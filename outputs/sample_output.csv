0,2015-01-01T00:01:05Z,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/01/uk-top-10-albums-2014-british-artists,UK top 10 albums of 2014 are all by British artists for first time,music,Music,The Guardian,"British artists have filled the entire top 10 bestselling albums chart for 2014 in the UK for the first time. Figures compiled by BPI, the trade body representing the British music industry, show that British artists have dominated album sales in the past 12 months, with the chart topped by Ed Sheeran whose second album X sold 1.7m copies – the highest album sales since Adele’s 21 in 2011. Sheeran was closely followed by the multi-award-winning debut from Sam Smith, In the Lonely Hour, which shifted 1.25m copies, while other big sellers of 2014 included George Ezra’s first album in third, Paolo Nutini, Coldplay and One Direction. Pink Floyd’s Endless River, the band’s first studio album in 20 years, also made it into the top 10. The only female artist to make it into the chart was the pop-soul singer Paloma Faith, with her album A Perfect Contradiction. This is the 10th year in a row that a British artist has topped the annual UK album bestsellers chart, following on from One Direction in 2013. Commenting on the notably strong year for British music, Geoff Taylor, chief executive of the BPI and Brit awards, described the success as remarkable and said the business was postitioned to expand further this year. “Our record labels are backing home-grown talent like Ed Sheeran, Sam Smith and George Ezra, who in turn are catching fire around the world.” But the success of individual artists was not enough to compensate for the continued decline in album sales overall, further confirming the predictions of industry pundits and even the head of music at Radio One, George Ergatoudis, that the format is heading towards extinction. There were 29.7m albums downloaded in 2014, down 9% on the year before, while 52.7m CDs were bought – a drop of almost 7%. The changing shape of the music industry was also underlined by the growing importance of streaming. The figures disclosed that the number of tracks streamed in Britain doubled in 2014, up from 7.5bn in 2013 to 14.8bn in 2014. Revenue from streaming in Britain this year was up 65% to £175m – overtaking revenue from single sales and downloads for the first time. This year was the first time that streams were included alongside downloads and physical sales in the Official Top 40 charts. One Direction were among the musicians who achieved 1bn streams on Spotify upon the release of their album Four in November, joining the ranks of fellow Brits Sheeran, Calvin Harris and Coldplay, while Mark Ronson’s track Uptown Funk broke the record for the most streamed track in a single week, with 2.5m plays in the final week of December. The shift in the way people are now consuming music could prove an interesting dilemma for artists such as Taylor Swift, who this year took her entire music back catalogue from the leading streaming service Spotify in protest that artists are only paid between around $0.006 and $0.0084 per song play. The increase in revenue from streaming was so great this year it almost completely offset the decline in album and single sales, ensuring that this year the total retail value of albums, singles and streams dropped by only 1.6% to £1.03bn. The streaming market is set to become more competitive this year with Apple launching its iTunes Beats streaming service and Google’s YouTube Music Key also set to launch, to compete with the likes of Spotify and Pandora.

1,2015-01-01T00:05:05Z,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jan/01/childcare-costs-nearly-half-average-salary-labour-analysis,Childcare costs nearly half the average salary – Labour analysis,money,Money,The Guardian,"Childcare costs have reached almost half of the average salary in some areas of the country, an analysis by the Labour party has found. Data collected from local councils found steep increases in the average costs of a 25-hour per week nursery place, with particularly high charges in London and the south-east. The highest figures quoted were in Bexley, south London, at £195 a week, and the highly marginal seat of Thurrock, Essex, at £185 a week. Childminder costs have also soared, with rates increasing particularly steeply in London – by more than £35 a week since 2010 in Croydon and Harrow. The highest weekly costs for childminders outside the City of London were said to be £200 a week in Barnet and £172.50 in Bexley. Overall, the cost of part-time childcare is now at least £100 a week in more than three-quarters of local authorities, Labour found through freedom of information requests. The party said this meant that in the vast majority of local areas, families were spending a quarter or more of their average weekly earnings on childcare. Alison McGovern, shadow minister for childcare, said the higher costs came at a time of fewer places and reduced government support. “Labour gets that increased help with childcare is good for families and good for the economy,” she said. “We would extend free childcare for three- and four-year-olds with parents in work from 15 to 25 hours, worth £1,500 per child, per year. We would also introduce a legal guarantee of childcare from 8am to 6pm, for parents of primary-aged children, helping families to balance work and family life.” The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, is intending to go into the election arguing that his party will best help families deal with the rising cost of living. Childcare is likely to be a big battleground issue, as the coalition parties have pushed through legislation to provide a discount of up to £2,000 per year per child, while Labour has pledged to extend the amount of free childcare for younger children. This week, a survey by the insurer Aviva found thousands of parents are in effect working for zero pay because of the high cost of childcare. This biannual report into family finances found that one in 10 working families with young children has an earner who brings home nothing after commuting, childcare and other work-associated expenses. The study also shows that one in four families include one parent who brings home less than £100 a month after costs, while 4% of women surveyed said they were actually paying to work because their costs were greater than their income . A separate report by employment consultancy The Jobs Economist highlighted the squeeze on some family incomes. It said the overall outlook for Britain’s jobs market in 2015 was the rosiest since 2007, but inequality in pay would increase as many people remained desperate for work.",profile/rowena-mason,Rowena,Mason
2,2015-01-01T00:05:05Z,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jan/01/david-cameron-ed-miliband-new-year-messages,David Cameron and Ed Miliband turn gaze towards 7 May,politics,Politics,The Guardian,"David Cameron and Ed Miliband have issued new year messages as they prepare for a flurry of general election campaigning in the first few days of 2015. With just over four months until voters go to the polls on 7 May, the leaders of the two main parties are expected to start spending much more time talking to voters around the country instead of working from Westminster. On Friday the prime minister is planning to launch his first campaign event of the year, and on Sunday he is expected to be interviewed on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. The Labour leader, meanwhile, is likely to start the year with a major speech early next week. Both parties have established what they call their narratives for the election. The Conservatives intend to focus on their economic record, while Labour will promise to address the cost of living and reduce inequality. With the polls continuing to show a lead for Miliband, the Conservatives are expected to start bombarding the public with their political messages over the coming weeks. The prime minister’s new year message continued the Tories’ familiar refrain of urging people “to stick to the plan, stay on course to prosperity, and keep doing the important, long-term work of securing a better future”. Cameron claimed there was good news on employment, lower taxes and a higher state pension, but warned that the global economy remained uncertain. “Britain has a choice,” he said, “between the competence that has got us this far, or the chaos of giving it up, going backwards and taking huge risks.”   David Cameron’s new year message  In an article for the Daily Telegraph today, he writes that the Conservatives are not just improving the economy, but “changing British values” in favour of hard work. Miliband’s message had a strongly positive tone, reflecting his intention to present his party as one of hope and change over the next few months. “This is the season for new beginnings and hopes for the future,” he said. “And Britain is ready for a new beginning. Because I don’t have to tell you that all over our country today there are people working harder and harder, but standing still; families struggling with bills that are growing faster than their wages; young people taking on mountains of debt to get a proper education, only to find themselves with no job at the other end; and an NHS where people are waiting longer and longer to get the care they need. “It doesn’t have to be this way. As this new year dawns, we have the chance to change direction; a chance to build a recovery for all of Britain … This year, we have the power to bring about the change working families all over Britain need. This isn’t about idle dreams or empty promises. It’s about a real, concrete plan: a plan for a recovery which reaches your kitchen table.” Jim Murphy, the new Labour leader in Scotland, and his deputy, Kezia Dugdale, also released a new year message. However, their outtakes video, which shows their human side as they mess around, giggle and forget their lines, attracted more attention.

The Rumour Mill’s had a few you see. But, don’t mess with fireworks kids. Or booze. Or Jim White. It won’t end well.  Speaking of things not ending well, Arsenal are in for Suárez again. Only this time it is Atlético Madrid’s Mario Suárez. A defensive midfielder. Yes, really. And the money on the table is not going to be £40m+£1. No, he’ll be much, much cheaper. Because he’s just OK. He’ll do a job. That’s it.  Arsène Wenger will have space in his squad for an average player if Lukas Podolski manages to jump the moat full of crocodiles surrounding the Emirates and shuffle off to Internazionale.  Oh, and it says here that Yaya Sanogo is going to Aston Villa. How’s that hangover feel now Villa fans? Ouch. Harry Redknapp is sniffing around for a striker. Harry Redknapp has been sniffing around for a striker since 1983. The QPR manager is not sniffing around for Peter Crouch though. No, the man doing that is Tony Pulis. Who else? Expect a couple of million quid to cover the costs of transporting Target Man down the M6 from Stoke to West Brom.  Brendan Rodgers has ruled out making any more signings in January. Well, Roma’s Radja Nainggolan and Bayern Munich’s Xerdan Shaqiri have made the decision for him after telling Liverpool to do one. And no, Divock Origi doesn’t count. They already own him.  Meanwhile, Mario Balotelli is off to Napoli if you believe some words written in an Italian newspaper. And MLS suits have got all hot and bothered after Rodgers said he wouldn’t stand in the way of Steven Gerrard if he wanted to say ta-ra to Anfield. The suit that is most hot and bothered is the New York Red Bulls one. That suit’s got a Thierry Henry-shaped hole to fill and Gerrard is just about the size and weight to fill it.

4,2015-01-01T00:35:43Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/01/kenny-lowe-the-man-leading-perth-glory-to-the-top-of-the-table,Kenny Lowe: the man leading Perth Glory to the top of the table,football,Football,The Guardian,"Kenny Lowe jokes that when he leaves Perth Glory, it’ll be the first club to ever give him the sack. It certainly won’t be under the same circumstances as his predecessor, Alistair Edwards, who was shown the door last season amid claims of favouritism involving the selection of his two sons. No, Lowe’s son, Rory, has found his calling away from football: stand-up comedy. “I’ve only watched him once or twice,” says Lowe senior, a tad awkwardly. “I’ll leave him to it. It’s probably good that me and the mum don’t go. We’d probably get hammered by him.” Lowe senior was around the same age as his son is now when he first came to Perth. The young midfielder from County Durham only stayed one full season, but it was the best year of his life. The America’s Cup was on, he was making lifelong friends, and trophies were piling up for him and for his state league side. The city has had a profound impact on Kenny Lowe. As an oil and gas engineer in his late thirties, he returned there with his family, and they found it impossible to leave. Twelve years later, he’s added two more to the clan - “our two little Aussies,” he calls them - and, almost from nowhere, he has become the hottest coach in the A-League. At least for now. The following week could be a defining one for the Westralians’ season. With back-to-back games against their biggest premiership rivals, Perth Glory could go into the Asian Cup break a good 10 points clear of the pack. Equally, they might spend January slumming it in third. The league leaders are at long odds for a win at Melbourne Victory on Friday night. It seems extraordinary, until you look at Victory’s home form. They’ve been almost unbeatable there under Kevin Muscat’s watch. It hasn’t happened since January, and their worst home result this season has been a solitary draw (though they did lose at Melbourne City). In Adelaide United, Glory will face the only side able to beat them so far this campaign. It’s something the Reds have managed twice: first in round three, and then again in the final of the inaugural FFA Cup. Yet Lowe sounds almost thankful for those results. “You have hardship. You have defeat. You have failure. That’s probably the best time in the world to learn about yourself and get better,” he tells The Guardian. “Because there’s things in that experience that you can actually analyse and understand to help make yourself become even better.” What he learnt from those games is that Glory needs to be better with the ball, and control the tempo of the game more effectively. “It’s not rocket science. I don’t want my goal-keeper having more touches than my creative central midfield player. We do need a balance.” He has another explanation for Adelaide too. “Yeah, they’ve got good players,” he laughs. “It’s not hard, is it. And they play a way that suits their good players.” Against the rest of the competition though, Perth have been so dominant they have spent barely 70 minutes - or 7% of the season - in arrears. So what’s been the secret to success so far this season? Lowe speaks in one breath about a blue collar work rate and the good character of his team, and then in the next about the importance of quality players. There’s Andy Keogh, for example, the new recruit whose form in front of goal is making it difficult for Ireland’s national selectors to ignore him. Lowe is a firm believer in the old maxim about great players making great coaches. “Why’s Mourinho good?,” he asks. “He’s good because he’s good, but it does help he’s got some of the best players in the world. Get him to Hartlepool on a wet night in the middle of winter in England and see how good he is then.” Lowe might have a minor obsession with the Portuguese. His name is scattered throughout the interview and a cursory glance of his Twitter account brings up more than the one tweet about his Chelsea counterpart. Might it explain why he likes to compare Glory with Atletico Madrid, Mourinho’s former crosstown rivals? All that said, as Perth’s youth coach, he was responsible for developing the likes of Fulham’s Adam Taggart, Holland-based pair Trent Sainsbury and Eli Babalj, and Roma-bound boy wonder Danny De Silva. “It gives you a real buzz to see those players doing really, really well.” Character and quality are both good, but Perth’s current success has arguably been shaped something more specific: set pieces. Exactly half of their goals have come from dead balls. No team has scored more goals this way. By comparison, Victory have scored barely one in three this way, Adelaide one in 5.  At the other end of the park, they’ve conceded just a quarter of their goals this way; Victory and Reds, the stingiest defences in the competition, have proved the league’s most vulnerable at set pieces. In other words, the longer Perth’s opponents this week can keep the ball the motion, the better chance they stand. For all the dangers Muscat and Gombau’s sides pose though, it’s a potential salary cap breach that could prove most damaging to Glory’s season. On that topic, the Perth coach is giving nothing away. “I won’t even speak about it,” he stonewalls. It’s one of the big unknowns in a season where nearly everything else has gone right, and could stop this season from being as fruitful for Lowe as his first in Perth was.",profile/jack-kerr,kerr,jack
5,2015-01-01T01:13:56Z,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/01/new-year-world-revelry-tragedy-fireworks-shanghai-london,Arrival of new year marked with revelry and marred by tragedy,world,World news,The Guardian,"Millions of people around the world lined waterfronts and filled city squares last night to welcome in 2015 with spectacular firework displays as well as traditional events – but celebrations in Shanghai were marred by tragedy, as dozens of revellers were killed and injured in a stampede. According to Chinese state media, at least 35 people were killed and 42 injured in the crush, which happened in the city’s Bund riverfront area at about 11.30pm local time. Emergency services soon arrived to aid the wounded in Chen Yi Square, an area that often becomes crowded during major events. It was not immediately clear what triggered the stampede. The official Xinhua news agency said many of the injured were students. Photographs on Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter, showed densely packed crowds of revellers along the Bund, which lies on the bank of the Huangpu river. In some photographs, rescue workers were seen trying to resuscitate victims on the pavement while ambulances waited nearby. Authorities had shown concern about crowd control in the days leading up to New Year’s Eve. They recently cancelled an annual 3D laser show on the Bund which attracted 300,000 people last year. New Zealand, the first country to celebrate the new year, celebrated with fireworks launched from Auckland’s Sky Tower, while in Australia an estimated 1.5 million spectators lined the harbour to watch the now renowned firework display on Sydney Harbour Bridge. The event, broadcast to an estimated billion people, featured a tribute to the two hostages killed in the December siege inside a cafe before seven tonnes of fireworks, including 10,000 aerial explosives and 100,000 pyrotechnics, went up in smoke. In Indonesia, celebrations were muted because of the recent loss of AirAsia Flight 8501. In Japan, people filled temples and shrines to pray for peace as bells struck 108 times to mark the number of temptations in Buddhism. Dubai saw hundreds of thousands of revellers watch fireworks launch from the Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building, which was wrapped with 70,000 panels to create the biggest ever illuminated LED facade. Meanwhile, a light show and fireworks marked the beginning of 2015 at the Olympic park in Beijing. Moscow was one of the first cities in Europe to mark the new year, with fireworks detonating over St Basil’s Cathedral and the Kremlin. In London, 100,000 people gathered on the banks of the Thames to watch an 11-minute firework display involving 12,000 pyrotechnics. This year’s event was ticketed for the first time, with revellers paying £10 each to access the fenced-off viewing area, after around half a million tried to squeeze into the area around the South Bank last year. “If you don’t have a ticket, the best place to watch the #londonnye fireworks will be live on the BBC,” the office of the London mayor, Boris Johnson, said on Twitter after telling the public that last year’s crowded conditions meant that a free event was “untenable”. However, he came under fire from opposition politicians over the ticketing and for the erection of mobile signs hammering home the message that the fireworks were being shown on the BBC. Fiona Twycross, a member of the London Assembly, described the signs as an insult to Londoners and visitors to the city and accused the mayor of privatising New Year by bringing in the ticketing system. Those who bought tickets, however, described the atmosphere as “electric”. In Scotland, Hogmanay celebrations on Stirling Castle’s esplanade were cancelled due to high winds. A live outdoor concert had been due to take place on the esplanade, with music from The Waterboys, Skerryvore, JJ Gilmour and Model Aeroplanes, followed by a fireworks display. However, the event was cancelled as high winds meant public safety could not be guaranteed, police said. Chief Inspector Paul Rollo, Stirling policing commander, said: “Hogmanay is one of the highlights of the year in the city, and the joint decision to cancel the street party was only taken after lengthy discussion and deliberation with the organisers. “We prioritise the safety of people attending an event and with the poor weather conditions right now with winds far stronger than expected, unfortunately this could not be assured.” Up to 75,000 people were expected to gather for the world-famous event in Edinburgh, which saw Lily Allen headlining the Concert in the Gardens. There were five live stages throughout the city, with 13 acts performing, including Soul II Soul and Twin Atlantic, plus four firework displays. Early celebrations included a torchlight parade when a cast of thousands carried flaming torches through the historic Old Town. Organisers said tickets for events have been bought by those in more than 70 countries, including Australia, Brazil, Mauritius, Slovakia and South Africa. Wilson Peery, 33, from Oregon, USA, travelled to Scotland especially to attend Edinburgh’s street party. He said: “I came here in 2008 and made a split second decision to come back this year with a group of friends. We all just decided to come. “I just really like the energy and the fact that there are so many things to do. The torchlight procession is something special.” As the new year reached Rio De Janeiro, millions flocked to Copacabana beach, where fireworks were launched from boats and artists and DJs performed on three stages for a traditional all beach party where many revellers wear white. In Havana, people roasted pigs for their traditional New Year’s Eve family dinners, often using a pit dug in the backyard. And in New York, thousands gathered in Times Square to see in 2015 and watch the traditional dropping of a giant crystal ball at midnight. Extra police were drafted in in case of possible further protests following the deaths of two unarmed black men at the hands of police officers in the city and in Ferguson, Missouri.",,,

At the end of an annus horribilis for bikies in the state, the demise of the Outcasts was held up as an example of a gang hounded out of existence by a regime that bans public bikie gatherings, clubhouses and recruiting. A Courier-Mail report credited the laws with forcing the departure of more than 20 members of the Outcasts, among a total of 317 bikies who quit clubs since the crackdown began in October 2013. This left only the self-proclaimed Queensland president of the Outcasts, likened by senior police to Monty Python’s Black Knight character, who famously dismissed his loss of limbs as “a flesh wound”. Former Outcast Russell “Camel” Wattie, a one-time federal Senate candidate, said the problem with this narrative was that the club had formally dissolved in Queensland more than a year before the laws were introduced. “The only thing I can call it is propaganda,” he said. “They’re using an internal thing in a club that happened 14 months beforehand as proof that the laws are working. It clearly had absolutely nothing to do with that.” Wattie said the national chapter of the club, based in Sydney, had taken back the Queenslanders’ colours in 2011 and the “Black Knight” was cut adrift. On the timing of the club’s split, the police agreed. They told Guardian Australia their records indicated the Outcasts had disbanded in Queensland in 2011, despite the remaining presence of its single member. But it said the Outcasts were considered a criminal gang in New South Wales and Victoria, so had been declared a criminal organisation in Queensland too. It said Outcasts members had been involved in drugs and violence offences and “demonstrated a willingness to obstruct, intimidate and assault police”. The new legislation had affected membership of bikie gangs in Queensland, the police said, “with members taking the opportunity to cut ties with the declared criminal organisations”. Public support has waxed and waned for a crackdown that has led to more than 4,000 charges against bikies and their associates, and police have vowed to press ahead with plans to wipe out the subculture in Queensland. In recent decades bikies in the state have handed hundreds of years’ worth of jail sentences for serious crimes including murder, drug trafficking and extortion. However, many bikies who do not have criminal records face a loss of livelihood as a result of bans from industries including the long-associated tattoo business. Criminologists have also challenged government claims that bikie gangs control the highly fragmented illicit drugs market. Wattie said bikies had resorted to gathering privately in homes and the subculture – which in his experience was not synonymous with organised crime – would survive underground. “So long as two blokes can ride together, they will,” he said.",profile/joshua-robertson,Joshua ,Robertson
7,2015-01-01T03:04:17Z,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jan/01/fgm-doctors-should-question-at-risk-women-during-prenatal-consultations,FGM: doctors should question at-risk women during prenatal consultations,society,Society,The Guardian,"Doctors have endorsed a call for questions about female genital mutilation (FGM) to be a requirement when they see women from affected communities for prenatal appointments. Khadija Gbla, a director of No FGM Australia, is due to give birth to her first child in February and struggled to find satisfactory medical care after disclosing she had FGM. She has now been classified as a “high risk” pregnancy and has a midwife to help her with her birth plan. Gbla, 26, who was born in Sierra Leone, was astounded she was not asked in her first Adelaide consultation if she had FGM, among standard questions on her family history of diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. “FGM made it quite difficult, it does have an impact on pregnancy and it’s been very negative from the get go,” she said. “In Adelaide there’s not a lot of knowledge in FGM so I have a lot of anxiety about it. I’m very stressed out. But I’m one of the lucky ones, what about the women who have it and don’t say anything? What about the women who don’t even know they have it? They need to be taken care of.” Gbla said women from FGM-affected communities, such as west African countries, Pakistan, Iraq, Egypt and Indonesia, should be asked if they had FGM when they first went to a doctor or midwife. Obstetrician Greg Jenkins, who conducts a weekly high-risk antenatal clinic at Auburn hospital in western Sydney, has treated many pregnant women with FGM and said it was certainly something doctors needed to know about. “We would take the view that those who are raised in communities where FGM is practiced, when they book into maternity unit they should be asked if they have a personal history of FGM,” he said. “It’s something we see reasonably often so we have a specific service to cater for it.” Jenkins said discussions about FGM should happen well before an expectant mother reached the delivery room, and doctors should be more aware of the risks it posed. “It definitely should happen ... overall increasing awareness is an important thing and then equipping people with information that they need in treating them is important,” he said. Jenkins said the risks associated with FGM could be greatly reduced with the right treatment before the delivery. His fellow obstetrician and former Australian Medical Association president Dr Andrew Pesce agreed that doctors needed targeted education campaigns.  “FGM was not on anyone’s radar of my generation when I was trained unless they were trained in an area of those communities, it was not something that they would ever give a thought to,” he said. “We need to have systems in place which alert midwives and doctors of these issues.” Pesce said the lack of data on how many women with FGM lived in Australia and how many girls were at risk of FGM was a big problem for doctors, who needed a system to obtain better data.  “Clinicians in all walks need to have some demographic data occasionally presented to them which makes them think about issues facing their community,” he said. “FGM comes up in hospitals when women are in labour and all of a sudden the doctor finds out when it’s too late to talk about. No clinic wants to be in that situation.” ",profile/bridie-jabour,Bridie,Jabour
8,2015-01-01T05:30:01Z,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/01/country-diary-in-the-bleak-midwinter,In the bleak midwinter,environment,Environment,The Guardian,"This was a day to raise the coat collar, hunch the shoulders and keep on the move, because the bare hedgerow offered little shelter from a bone-aching north-westerly wind. Fieldfares had stripped the last of the hawthorn berries long before Christmas. Now, apart from a solitary crow that flew away as I approached, the landscape seemed lifeless and bleak. But then there was a sudden flurry of activity amongst the tangle of branches and briars beside the footpath, and soon I was surrounded by a flock of long-tailed tits. I can think of few birds so certain to lift the spirits in midwinter. They bounded along the hedge beside me in a restless flock, hyperactive acrobats, each pausing for just a second or two to search for food morsels. It is a wonder that such waif-like birds, seemingly just ragged bundles of grey, black and pink feathers, survive winter at all. Even if I spent an hour scrutinising twigs with a magnifying glass, I doubt that I would be able to find more than a few insect eggs and perhaps a spider or two. Their survival seems to depend on constant movement, spending each second of the daylight hours in a relentless search of every nook and cranny. They flew on ahead of me but I caught up with them again on the edge of a wood, where they were foraging in the low branches of a sycamore. Part of the charm of these birds is that they are so fearless when they are intent on feeding. There were moments when I could have reached out and touched them. I could hear the scratch of beaks and claws on tree bark and the rustle of wing feathers. Sometimes they dangled below branches like trapeze artists, perhaps searching for aphid eggs on buds, using their long tails as counterbalances.

The minimum bet limit will be even higher for larger bookies, who will have to take any wager on a metropolitan race that pays out up to $2,000. Racing NSW implemented the new guidelines in September after receiving hundreds of complaints from punters claiming their online betting accounts were frozen or restricted after a string of successful bets. But the state gaming minister, Troy Grant, said some online bookies had “refused to express unqualified support for the new minimum bet rules”. It is understood that Racing NSW has continued to receive reports of internet bookmakers flouting the guidelines. “It is not fair to have wagering operators profit from punter losses but then bar or restrict successful punters in the amount they can wager on any one bet,” Grant said. “This is the same rule that applies to on-course bookies and maintains the integrity of thoroughbred racing.” Richard Irvine, from the punters’ lobby group Fair Wagering, claims companies such as Luxbet, Centrebet and Bet365 – all of which are based in the Northern Territory for tax reasons – actively discriminate against successful amateurs and professional gamblers. Five NT-based bookies have severely restricted or closed his accounts citing commercial reasons. He welcomed the decision by the NSW government, the first in the country to apply minimum bet laws to online bookies.  “Hopefully it will be adopted Australia-wide over the next year,” he said. “Government support is a huge advantage and also gives the cause the credibility it deserves.” Another online bookmaker, Sportsbet, successfully defended its right to reject bets in the Victorian civil and administrative tribunal in December 2013, after restricting the account of a Melbourne man who won $22,500 in just over a month betting on horse races. NT-based bookmakers oversaw $8.5bn in bets last financial year and the Australian industry has attracted heavy investment from foreign betting giants such as William Hill, which bought up Tom Waterhouse, SportingBet and Centrebet in 2013.

If fashion goes the way experts predict, you will no longer need something to carry that gym kit around with you. Because, get this, you’ll be wearing it all day. Athleisure is the buzzword of the fashion industry – a hybrid of sportswear and the rest of your wardrobe, it translates to clothes that look a bit sporty but don’t need to be accessorised with a yoga mat and a smoothie. This sector will grow by around 24% in the next five years, suggests Jessica Fioriti of retail analyst Verdict: “It used to be that only sportswear brands like Nike and Adidas were popular. We’ve seen a change recently where consumers are willing to buy fashion brands doing sportswear.” Alexander Wang’s collection for H&M, launched in November, is the kind of thing. Sure, leather joggers and six-inch-heeled boots might raise eyebrows on the cross-trainer but, out of a collection of more than 100 pieces, it was striking how much was gym-ready: sports bras, hoodies, vests, shorts and leggings. There was even a Wang boxing bag. “I live in gym clothes,” Wang told the New York Times. “When you go out on the street, it’s the uniform now.” He’s not the only one to think so. With Mary Katrantzou’s collection for Adidas, Richard Nicoll working with Sweaty Betty, posh gymwear brands such as Lucas Hugh and an upcoming collaboration between Nike and Japanese catwalk brand Sacai, athleisure is suddenly looking less a made-up word and more a real thing.    Mary Katrantzou’s collection for Adidas. Photograph: Publicity image   There’s definitely a case for clothes that respond to lives, that take in a morning gym session, a day at work and night out. They also fit well into a wardrobe in which sportswear has become a staple. “If in the 50s we all had pillbox hats and gloves, now we have trainers and sweatshirts,” says Natalie Kingham, buying director at matchesfashion.com. Kingham argues that the emergence of something like athleisure has been a long time coming. “I have friends who go from the school run to the gym, and that lifestyle hasn’t been serviced,” she says. Net-a-porter launched Net-a-Sporter earlier this year to fill that gap, and boasts an “après” area of the site with clothes that, says senior buyer (and qualified yoga instructor) Candice Fragis, cater to “women who want to be able to wear their fitness clothes after Pilates to lunch with a friend”. If that’s for the yummy-mummy crowd, Richard Nicoll worked with Sweaty Betty – hardly a brand on most London fashion week designers’ radars – to design something that fits in with the rest of us. “I would love to be able to run to work, do my day and run home without necessarily looking as though I have been to Niketown,” he says. “I think performance clothing will become increasingly stylish and less ‘sporty’-looking.” Nicoll might well be right. The biggest boost for athleisure came in October. Topshop announced that it would be working on a joint venture with Beyoncé to create a “global athletic streetwear brand” in autumn 2015. “We’ve been looking at that sector for a while,” Topshop owner Sir Philip Green told WWD. “It’s something we need to be in. Based on what she [Beyoncé] does, how she works out, the conversation got into that category.” Granted, not all of us can include a regime of dancing in high heels and working out five times a week in our schedule. But, increasingly, we want to look as if we can. Athleisure clothes, ultimately, fulfil that role. “Even if we aren’t going to the gym, we’re wearing pieces that look like we have,” says Kingham. “That lifestyle has aspirational status now.” Athleisure is the perfect solution, really – clothes that cater to a gym bunny’s lifestyle, whether you actually live it or not. Couch potatoes head-to-toe in Lycra could well become a familiar sight in 2015.

12,2015-01-01T06:02:38Z,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/01/snapchat-funding-valuation-investors-messaging-app,Snapchat reveals $485m of funding at a reported $10bn valuation,technology,Technology,The Guardian,"Messaging app Snapchat has raised its latest round of funding, $485.6m, which may value the US-based company at more than $10bn. The funding was revealed in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with 23 investors taking part in the round, which takes Snapchat’s total funding so far to just under $648m. The filing leaves those investors unidentified, but reports from Bloomberg and TechCrunch both suggest technology company Yahoo and venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers were involved in the round. Both reports also suggest that the round values Snapchat at $10bn, little over a year after the company rejected a $3bn acquisition offer from Facebook. The details of the funding round were revealed at the end of a year that has seen rapid growth for Snapchat, which is thought to now have 200 million active users sending photos and videos to one another – up from 100 million earlier in 2014. Snapchat has also made its first steps towards making money, launching its first advertisement – a 20-second trailer for horror film Ouija, paid for by studio Universal Pictures – in October. 2014 was a challenging year for Snapchat in other ways, however. The company eventually settled a lawsuit from ousted co-founder Reggie Brown, and faced scrutiny in October after explicit images sent by users were leaked in a breach nicknamed “The Snappening”. That turned out to be due to people using an external site called SnapSaved, which promised the ability for Snapchat users to save the pictures sent to them by friends, rather than have them self-deleted. Snapchat warned users not to log in to its service through third-party apps and sites as a result, although 2014 also saw US regulator the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reprimanding the company over its claims that users’ messages were guaranteed to “disappear forever”. The FTC recently reached a settlement with Snapchat that requires the company to put in place a “comprehensive privacy program” to protect its users, to be monitored by an external privacy and data protection expert for the next 20 years. Still, investors haven’t been put off the company, leaving it flush with cash to continue its growth in 2015. Besides growing its advertising business, Snapchat has ambitions to become more than just a messaging app for its predominantly young users. In November 2014, a report by Digiday claimed that Snapchat was in talks with companies including BuzzFeed, Spotify, Vice and MailOnline to add music, news and videos to a new section of its app called “Discover”. In December, leaked emails from Hollywood studio Sony Pictures – whose chief executive Michael Lynton is a board member at Snapchat – hinted at ambitions to turn Snapchat into a fully-fledged digital music service. The leaks also revealed Snapchat’s acquisition of QR code-scanning startup Scan.me and eyeglass video camera firm Vergence Labs. Snapchat chief executive Evan Spiegel subsequently revealed he was “devastated” by the leaks of the company’s plans. • Messaging apps’ next threads: encryption, payments, media, ads • Ten things you need to know about Snapchat",profile/stuart-dredge,dredge,stuart

Taking up his seat on the green benches of opposition, Ukip’s newest honourable member might even find himself squashed beside Caroline Lucas of the Greens, whose party split the Labour vote just enough to deny the new prime minister Ed Miliband a majority. And perhaps to the right of Salmond sits Boris Johnson, the newbie MP for Uxbridge and now clear favourite to win the Conservative leadership contest following the resignation of a defeated David Cameron. Nick Clegg and a couple of lonely Lib Dems loiter at the back, despondent at losing their space on the government side. That is just one fantasy parliament – among the most likely, if you believe the pollsters and the bookies – out of all the manifold combinations for the outcome of the election in just over four months’ time. Tory or Labour majority, Tory or Labour minority, Lab-Lib or Tory-Lib coalition, even Lab-SNP or Tory-Ukip coalition. Any of these are possible at a time when the previously inconceivable option of a multi-party rainbow alliance or Tory-Labour grand coalition has been mooted if Ukip pulled off a miracle. The point is that not even the most seasoned Westminster watchers feel confident enough to call the election for one side or the other.    Ed Miliband and David Cameron: just 66% of electors express an intention to vote for one of their parties. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images   And while clearly either Cameron or Miliband will find themselves walking into No 10 on 8 May, it may be hard to shake off the feeling that the victory for either man is one of accident rather than overwhelming popular support and ingenious political strategising. A major theme, therefore, of 2015 is going to be the weakness of the two major parties and how far the minor challengers can inflict damage on them. Both Labour and the Conservatives are going to be desperate to cast the election as a two-horse race, in which only one of their leaders gets the prize of premiership. But in reality, they are both going to be jostled all the way along a crowded electoral course by Ukip, the SNP, the Greens and even the deeply unpopular Lib Dems, who hold dozens of key marginals that could decide the outcome. It just depends which of the two key contenders is slowed down more by the other riders. It is a deeply risky situation for the two main parties that, with so short a time before polling day, this is set to be the year of their lowest popularity since the polling company Ipsos MORI began collecting records in 1978. In that year, known for its industrial disputes and the winter of discontent, 91% of people still identified with either Labour or the Conservatives. In contrast, just 66% of us today express an intention to vote for the parties of either Ed Miliband or David Cameron – the only two really feasible candidates to be the next prime minister. This is lower even than 1981, when Labour’s support was hollowed out by defectors to the newly formed Social Democratic party (SDP). With a similar turnout to last time, only around a quarter of the voting-age population will probably have backed the winning party on election day. Academics such as Dr Stephen Fisher of Oxford University still predict Labour and the Conservatives will take around 90% of the seats overall, because of the first-past-the-post system that hands victory to whoever is in the lead in each individual constituency. However, the minor parties have a huge ability to influence the final result, depending on whose vote they devour the most. Ukip is obviously causing the most high-profile squeeze on the two traditional leading parties, taking at least three times as many votes from the Conservatives as Labour. But the impact of the other challengers will also cause nail-biting in the party HQs. Labour has now identified at least 17 seats where it is at risk of failing to take the constituency because the Green party is chomping through their core leftwing support. Party strategists say Iraq – a decade on – is still an issue that is stopping leftwingers from returning to Labour. In Scotland, despite the election of a credible new national Labour leader in Jim Murphy and defeat of the yes campaign at the referendum, Miliband could be looking at the loss of more than a dozen of his MPs to the resurgent SNP. And while the Liberal Democrats’ national share of the vote has been severely hit under the coalition, the party is still clinging to the hope that it may hold on in its established strongholds. With this in mind, senior Lib Dem cabinet ministers are spending hardly any time in Whitehall, in favour of lavishing love on their constituencies. Polling by former Conservative donor Lord Ashcroft shows that support for the party has actually increased in seats such as Sutton & Cheam in south London and Eastbourne on the south coast.    Alex Salmond: soon to be seen in Westminster? Photograph: Ken Jack/Demotix/Corbis   In an election where a small number of knife-edge seats are crucial to the overall result, the tiniest swing will make a difference. Strategists estimate a good local candidate can give a 2% boost. So prepare for the contest to get hyper-local over the next few months. Senior Tory and Labour politicians will be obsessing about pot-holes, anti-social behaviour and dog poo on the pavement as well as the macro-issues of the economy, immigration and NHS. Leaflets from the 2015 slate of candidates have begun to drop through letterboxes and there is an evident trend already. Few and far between among the Tory and Labour specimens display photos of the parliamentary candidates glad-handing voters with their dear leaders in shot. Some have only the tiniest references to their own parties. There is plenty of “normalising” of CVs to stress real-world jobs and working-class roots when in truth they should be catalogues of lives lived in Westminster. It seems the traditional parties are a liability to the parliamentary hopeful, not an asset – something of which the new crop of MPs will be only too aware. To return to that fantasy parliament, it is likely to be a boisterous one. If its members end up owing little of their success to the merits of their respective Tory and Labour leaders, the Commons is bound for five years of rebellion.",profile/rowena-mason,Rowena,Mason

Four more years of austerity is “a price that works for our country”, Osborne said as he outlined his strategy. The Institute for Fiscal Studies responded by warning that “colossal” cuts to the state would take total government spending to its lowest level as a proportion of national income since before the second world war. By the end of the process, “the role and shape of the state will have changed beyond recognition”, the think tank said. So far, £35bn has been cut; the plan is to cut a further £55bn by 2019. If the chancellor remains in post after the general election, Britain will find itself halfway through a nine-year stretch of spending cuts, with the Conservatives determined to shrink and redefine the role of the state. The Liberal Democrats say the Conservative policy is aimed at creating “a smaller state, with many more cuts to come”, giving Britain “austerity for ever”; 2015 will be a pivotal year in the race to reshape the nature of the state. Even if they lose, difficult spending cuts look inevitable. Labour is also committed to ending the deficit, in 2017-18, provided the state of the economy allows it.    Protesters demonstrate against the bedroom tax. Photograph: Matthew Lloyd/Getty Images   For many publicly funded services and organisations, 2015 will be the year when their chances of survival become clear. There is an enormous range in the size and the function of services under threat, which makes tracking the scale of the cuts challenging. Here are just four examples – from the large scale to the tiny, of services that are set to go this year. In June, the Independent Living Fund, which provides funding for around 18,000 disabled people to work and live in the community, will be wound down. In Liverpool, there will be a decision in early 2015 over whether the council will close a possible 23 out of the city’s 26 Sure Start centres. On a smaller scale, organisations including the Islington Centre for Refugees and Migrants, in north London, which supports around 150 refugees and asylum seekers, providing English classes, faces closure because of cuts to education budgets. “These are people who come to us on a daily basis who desperately need some kind of support,” project manager Andy Ruiz Palma says. “I would lose my job, but I am more worried about the clients. There is nowhere else for them to go.” In Ealing, west London, parents are campaigning to save the lollipop crossing role, done for the past 20 years by Eileen Rowles, and now at risk of being discontinued because of council spending cuts. The Office for Budget Responsibility said in December that the chancellor’s plans would mean one million further government job losses by 2020 (a total fall from early 2011 of 1.3 million), representing a 20% fall in headcount. Over the past five years, there has been surprise and relief from politicians that public anger about spending cuts has been relatively muted. Aside from a few annual anti-cuts marches in big cities, Britain has not experienced the waves of protest seen in countries such as Spain. Given that those most affected by the cuts are the most vulnerable and disempowered people in society, it’s perhaps not surprising that the response has been muted. But that could change in 2015. The next stage of cutbacks is likely to be harder to ignore. The easy decisions have already been made; once the low-hanging fruit has been removed, finding new things to cut gets harder, which means the second half of the austerity era is likely to be much tougher than the first. By next May, government funding for councils will be 40% lower than it was in 2010; and a further 13% will need to be cut in 2015. “It is individuals who have paid the price of funding reductions, whether it is through seeing their local library close, roads deteriorate or support for young people or families scaled back. Further reductions without radical reform will have a detrimental impact on people’s quality of life,” the Local Government Association chair, David Sparks, says.    The 2011 campaign to save a London library from closure. Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian   The National Audit Office has warned that more than half of councils currently risk falling into serious financial crisis before the end of the decade. Some may struggle to provide services that they are legally obliged to offer, and this may become apparent in 2015 with more legal action by service users. Nicola Smith, head of economic affairs at the TUC, says: “The scale of the spending cuts that the chancellor set out in his autumn statement briefing is truly severe. The public sector has already experienced five years of austerity. The consequences for key services that people rely on are severe.” Osborne has said that if the Conservatives win the election he will want to cut a further £12bn a year from the welfare bill – on top of the £20m-£25m that has already been cut. He proposes freezing working-age benefits for two years, reducing the overall benefit cap from £26,000 to £23,000, and limiting access to housing benefit for people under 21. Professor John Hills, director of the Centre for Analysis of Social Exclusion at the London School of Economics, says that the impact of further cuts in this area would be very painful. “Both the political and public belief is that spending on out-of-work benefits is a large share of overall public spending; it is not. Trying to make large savings from what is really a small share of public spending will require increasingly harsh cuts. We have seen this already through things like the bedroom tax, the imposition of council tax on people with very low incomes, and the greatly increased use of sanctioning.

The Ma’an Network, an independent, non-profit media organisation that broadcasts across the West Bank and Gaza, will use a £730,000 grant from the UK government to air shows that tackle often taboo subjects, such as marital rape, over the next three years.  The programmes will be supported by a series of workshops in more remote, conservative areas to discuss violence prevention. The workshops will be aimed at women, men and children, and religious and local leaders will be encouraged to attend. Ma’an has already set up a gender unit, staffed by three people – a journalist, a lawyer and an education expert – to oversee content. The court room programme will use actors to simulate real-life cases of violence, which will be brought before a professional judge and lawyers. The comedy sketch show – Put yourself in my shoes – will have women and men switching roles. The sketch show is likely to be broadcast in the evenings during Ramadan, a time with traditionally high viewing figures. The network will also run a series of programmes profiling inspirational Palestinian women.  “Violence against women in my country is still widespread,” said Raed Othman, founder and general director of the network. “Women are still killed because of ‘honour’… if families think they have a sexual relationship outside of marriage. Still in my country there is significant violence against women – economic violence against women, social violence, verbal violence against women.  “So in the court we will choose real stories. Serious issues that don’t come up, like the rape of a wife. No woman will go to court and declare her husband raped her. What we will do is discuss these issues in court, let women in society understand their rights in law and how they can deal with it.” According to a report published by the Palestinian Authority in 2011, culture and tradition were often the main justifications for violence against women in Palestine. The continuing Israeli occupation was also having a disproportionate effect on women. “The occupation increases the burden on Palestinian women by destroying infrastructure and endangering their human security, further contributing to the denial of their basic rights,” said the report, which set out an eight-year national strategy to tackle the problem. A 2009 study conducted by UN Women, cited in the report, found that violence against women increased in the aftermath of military strikes on Gaza in December 2008. Surveys carried out by the Women’s Security Index Coalition, formed by Palestinian and Israeli women’s rights organsations, found that women living in Palestine feared rape, domestic violence, discrimination, economic uncertainty and intimidation by the police and the army. The Ma’an Network project is the first of its kind in this region, and aims to reach more than 4 million people. “It is the first time we have had this big media activity,” Othman said. “Normally, women’s organisations have something like this, but on a small scale. They have a TV spot for example, about not hitting your wife, or a talk show to discuss one issue. But this is the first time we’ve created a sustainable three-year project with a lot of activities.”",profile/lizford,ford,liz
17,2015-01-01T07:00:03Z,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/01/jamie-oliver-leads-drive-to-buy-misshapen-fruit-and-vegetables,Jamie Oliver leads drive to buy misshapen fruit and vegetables,food,Food,The Guardian,"Jamie Oliver, who has led the campaign for improved school meals, is turning his attention to a campaign encouraging shoppers to buy “crooked” carrots, knobbly pears and wonky potatoes, in an effort to reduce food waste. Misshapen but perfectly edible fruit and vegetables that would otherwise go to waste will be sold by Asda at discounted prices in a national trial starting at the end of January. The retailer – the UK’s second largest supermarket – said long-standing consumer resistance was about price and quality, but its research showed that 65% of its customers were now open to the idea of buying oddly shaped fresh produce, while 75% would definitely buy “wonky” if it was cheaper. The initiative was triggered by an investigation into the scale of the UK’s food waste carried out by the celebrity chef and farmer Jimmy Doherty. It features in the TV programme Friday Night Feast, which starts on Friday night on Channel 4. In the first programme, the pair meet farmers who tell them that they were unable to sell thousands of tonnes of their fresh vegetables to supermarkets because they were deemed imperfect. They approached Asda to suggest a small trial in store – filmed for the programme – to gauge customer perceptions of wonky produce and whether they would be willing to buy it at a discount. “If most Brits had half an idea of the amount going to waste, they’d be snapping up ugly veg by the trolley load,” Oliver said. “There’s no difference whatsoever in taste or nutritional value. This is perfectly good food that could and should be eaten by humans. When half a million people in the UK are relying on food banks, this waste isn’t just bonkers – it’s bordering on criminal.” Fruit and vegetables in Asda’s new Beautiful on the Inside range will be bagged separately and sold for 30% less than their “perfect” peers, as the supermarket hopes to educate shoppers on the benefits of “buying ugly” while also supporting farmers. The campaign and dedicated range will launch in selected stores from 26 January, with a view to being rolled out nationally. Shape up or ship out In July 2009, a controversial EU ban on fresh produce (26 types of fruit and vegetables) that failed to match standard shapes and sizes – such as bent carrots, curled cucumbers and knobbly potatoes – was lifted. Up to that point, an estimated 20% to 40% of UK fruit and vegetables was routinely rejected before it reached the shops. But an expected deluge of wonky veg onto supermarket shelves failed to materialise. The supermarkets blamed consumers for being obsessed with perfection, while farmers blamed supermarkets for sticking to rigid, high technical specifications. Retailers have gradually been relaxing these, and food banks and organisations such as Food Cycle have been grateful recipients of rejected produce. But successive reports on food waste in the supply chain show that much more could be done to make use of edible, if misshapen, foods. Ian Harrison, produce technical director at Asda said: “Even if fruit and veg have some knobbles and blemishes, this doesn’t affect the quality or taste – a carrot is still a carrot. Customers are simply looking for great-tasting, fresh produce at a value price. Our growers are savvy and already use a large percentage of this wonky crop for further processing, for things like ready meals and juicing, but we saw an opportunity to extend this even more.” In the first programme Oliver and Doherty meet farmers Olly and Kevin Hammond, who have been growing carrots and parsnips at Tattersett Farm in Norfolk since 1959. Doherty said: “Anything that doesn’t make the grade gets chucked. It’s a massive waste for farmers. Where ‘A’ grade carrots sell for £800 a tonne, they practically give the ugly ones away for animal feed for just £10.” The move is supported by the government’s food waste reduction advisory body Wrap, which has said that loss and waste in the fresh produce supply chain averaged out at less than 10% but could be as high as 25% for apples, onions and potatoes. Other large supermarkets such as Sainsbury’s and Waitrose have relaxed their specifications to sell some ugly and imperfect produce, but this is the first initiative to clearly identify and separate them from the mainstream alternative. Emma Marsh, head of Love Food Hate Waste, said: “Buying misshapen or blemished fruit and vegetables doesn’t mean you are sacrificing any of the taste. Food costs money and precious resources to produce, so we should value it.” Kiti Soininen, head of UK food and drink research at the market research company Mintel, commented: “It is clear that consumers are open to ugly produce, but where oddly shaped fruit and veg sits with mainstream offerings, it is at risk of going unchosen, even if subconsciously. Price comes across as a real consideration for many and positioning ugly fruit and vegetables as a tasty, low-cost option should help to reach this group.”",profile/rebeccasmithers,Rebecca ,Smithers
18,2015-01-01T07:10:49Z,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jan/01/mapp-and-lucia-review-richardson-chancellor,Mapp and Lucia review – beautifully tart one-upwomanship,tv-and-radio,Television & radio,The Guardian,"A seemingly impossible task lay ahead of The League of Gentlemen’s Steve Pemberton, judging by the number of people I’d seen expressing their terror at the thought of his new adaptation of EF Benson’s comic novels about Mapp and Lucia (BBC1), two 1930s society mavens engaged in all-out war for dominance of a picturesque Sussex town. They couldn’t possibly like it if it wasn’t Channel 4’s 1980s version starring Geraldine McEwan and Prunella Scales, they declared. Although McEwan and Scales were brilliant, that’s no reason to place the books under glass, never to be touched again. It’s a self-sabotaging approach to believe only one actor can play a particular part. Can’t both Jeremy Brett and Basil Rathbone (not to mention Benedict Cumberbatch) be great Sherlock Holmeses? Well, if you did stay away, you missed a truly delightful piece of television and two splendid performances from Anna Chancellor, as melodramatic widow Emmeline “Lucia” Lucas, and Miranda Richardson, who gloriously inhabited the hoisted bosom and toothy fizzog of Elizabeth Mapp. More on those teeth later. Pemberton’s nicely carbonated three-parter drew to a close, leaving me champing at the bit for more. More of Chancellor and Richardson’s beautifully tart one-upwomanship. More of the distractingly pretty Rye, its cobbles so perfectly suited to thwarting Mapp’s ungainly progress in low heels when trying to spy on her rival. More of the game supporting cast, including Felicity Montagu’s increasingly furious Diva, Mapp’s conscience and grudging ally. “One of us is going to have to dye,” barked Mapp at her friend when they turned up to a function in similar salmon pink frocks. And definitely more of Pemberton’s clearly affectionate dialogue, with its acute ear for Benson’s subtly devastating zingers. The subtle chill of the Channel 4 adaptation is replaced with something warmer, perhaps in the palette of the production design or the performances of the supporting cast, but it by no means dilutes the acid that pours forth whenever the two women are in a room together. Richardson completely transformed herself with the simple addition of some distractingly prominent teeth, as befits Benson’s description. Before seeing her in action, I couldn’t picture her in Scales’s shoes, but whereas Chancellor was riffing on a performance style she has used before, this seemed like something genuinely out of Richardson’s comfort zone. They contrasted each other flawlessly, one gliding over the cobbles while the other bobbed along clumsily, feeling every bump. Last night’s final visit to Tilling (Rye’s fictional alter ego) began with Lucia’s ludicrously self-indulgent musical recital, to which she had graciously invited Mapp after weeks of social stand-off. “Beethoven AND tomatoes,” beamed Mapp tightly. “Yum.” As their gossamer truce dissolved, Mapp engaged in a determined plot to prove that Lucia was not in fact able to speak fluent Italian. It was an increasingly deranged campaign that saw Mapp, wild-of-eye, hair in disarray, hanging off the church tower spying on her insouciant adversary as she performed physical jerks in a striped bathing suit “like a wasp” when she should have been in bed with flu. As if we hadn’t been spoiled enough for stunning female performances by the two leads, plus Montagu and Tuesday night’s excellent cameos by Joanna Scanlan and Katy Brand, the final episode was almost stolen by Frances Barber, who roared into town as Amelia, Contessa di Faraglione, to a suitably operatic change in the score. For a plot device brought in to merely disprove Lucia’s Italian hogwashery, Barber didn’t half make her mark. Meanwhile, as the briefly banished Georgie Pillson, Pemberton allowed himself a tiny self-indulgence when his character overheard the staff speculating on his homosexuality and hairpiece; a small glimpse of an emotional inner life in an otherwise comically focused performance. His adaptation paced the plot neatly over three hours, inserting a new character at just the right point in the story. As the episode reached its climax, a horde of extras took part in a behatted stampede, underscored by Zadok the Priest, when word got out that the Prince of Wales’s car was driving towards Tilling town centre. This flag-waving glee summed up the spirit behind the whole series. Everyone seemed genuinely, infectiously pleased to be there. With Lucia’s decision to settle permanently in the town, Mapp was left to grimace as she dug in for the battles yet to come. I very much hope to see these future rumbles on screen, as I’d sit through another dozen rounds at least. Not goodbye then, but au reservoir, as they say in Tilling.",profile/juliaraeside,raeside,julia

Mark Taylor, also known as Abu Abdul-Rahman, apparently deleted 45 longstanding tweets earlier this week after discovering they revealed his exact coordinates. Using some of the tweets, researcher Jeff Weyers, who runs the open-source intelligence group iBrado, was able to pinpoint Taylor’s location in early December to a specific house in al-Taqbah, a Syrian town near the Isis stronghold of al-Raqqa. Taylor, who slipped out of New Zealand in May 2012 despite being subject to travel restrictions, surfaced in Syria in June last year. “My current location is in Syria and my commitment is for jihad for Allah, and his Messenger,” he said in a Youtube video posted that month. He initially told New Zealand media that he would remain in Syria until he achieved “martyrdom”, but appeared to have second thoughts by September, claiming he had realised Syria instead needed humanitarian aid and support. Taylor proudly displayed his burnt New Zealand passport in a Facebook post in June, in which he declared his move to Syria was a “one-way trip, no going back”. He claims to have since been in touch with New Zealand’s passport office to secure a replacement, but hasn’t heard back. He was placed on a watch list after visiting another New Zealand radical, Muslim bin John, in Yemen in 2009. John was killed by a drone strike in Yemen in November 2013 along with an Australian, Christopher Harvard.

21,2015-01-01T07:30:04Z,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jan/01/mourn-death-wallet-phones-contactless-cards,Mourn the death of the wallet – it holds memories as well as money,fashion,Fashion,The Guardian,"Let’s start with a quick quiz that will establish, once and for all, whether you are old. I’m not interested in your age in actual years; this is about your age in pop cultural years. Which are a bit like dog years, in that you can go from prime-of-life to past-it really scarily fast. Question one: you are paying for a flat white on your way to work. Do you (a) count out £2.10 in coins, enjoying the familiar small but tangible sense of satisfaction at getting rid of your coppers, or (b) tap your contactless debit card against the reader? Question two: have you got a first-class stamp I could borrow, by any chance? Is the answer (a) yes, hang on a mo, I’ve got a book of six somewhere – look, here it is, it was hiding behind my National Trust membership card or (b) a stamp? For what? Hey, shall I download the Paperless Post app for you? If you answered (a) to both of the above then you, like me, are officially old. To take your mind off it, try this one: what do the following items have in common? Money, photos of your boyfriend/dog/baby, public transport pass, train and plane tickets, gym timetable, the phone number of that good plumber your colleague passed on, shopping list for the way home, a recipe clipping from a magazine. The answer? These are things that were once essential to carry about your person, now made obsolete by two physical objects – a bank card and a smartphone – which take up less space.    Contactless payment means carry cashing cash is not necessary. Photograph: Alamy   The result of all this is that the wallet, that great talisman of adult life, is heading for extinction. As a day-to-day essential, it will die off with the generation who read print newspapers. Most of us, as children, played shops with Fisher Price tills, counting out the plastic coins and swapping them for plastic tomatoes. And we have grown up, and continued to do real shopping, in almost exactly the same way. But that kind of shopping – where you hand over notes and count out change in return – now happens only in the most minor of our retail encounters. Buying a bar of chocolate or a pint of milk, from a cornershop or a train station kiosk. At the shops where you spend any real money, that money is increasingly abstracted. And this is more and more true, the higher up the scale you go. At the most cutting-edge retail flagships – Victoria Beckham on Dover Street, say, or Burberry on Regent Street – you don’t go and stand at any kind of till, when you decide to pay. The staff are equipped with iPads which they can whip out and use to take your payment while you relax on a sofa. Which is nothing more or less than excellent service, if you have the money. But across society, the abstraction of the idea of cash – the tap of contactless payments, which happen in less time than it takes your brain to compute the fact that you have just spent money – makes me uneasy. Maybe I’m just old-fashioned, I don’t know. But earning money isn’t quick or easy, for most of us. Isn’t it a bit weird that spending it, on the other hand, should happen in half a blink of an eye? Doesn’t a wallet – that time-honoured Friday-night feeling of pleasing, promising fatness; the flipside of a lean day – represent something that matters? But I’ll leave the economics to the experts. What bothers me about the death of the wallet is the change it represents in our physical environment. Everything about the look and feel of a wallet – the nooks and crannies, the way the fastenings and materials wear and sag and loosen with age, the diverse microclimate of plastic and paper and gold and silver, of braille-printed numbers and faded passport photos, of handwritten phone numbers and printed cinema tickets – is the very opposite of what our world is becoming. The opposite of a wallet is a smartphone, or a tablet. The rounded edges, cool glass, smooth and unknowable as a pebble. Instead of rustling through pieces of paper and peering into corners, we swipe the pads of our fingers left and right. No corners, no papercuts, no memories ambushing you as a forgotten restaurant card turns up like a lucky penny. No more counting out coppers; instead, Candy Crush. Show your wallet – if you still have one – some love, in 2015. It may not be here much longer.",profile/jesscartnermorley,Jess,Cartner-Morley
22,2015-01-01T08:00:04Z,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jan/01/nhs-emergency-care-wobbly-legs,NHS emergency care on wobbly legs,society,Society,The Guardian,"If the NHS’s recent performance underwent one of the service’s own health checks, the readings would have the doctor concerned prescribing urgent medical intervention. Almost every day brings new evidence of an increasingly worrying situation that looks ominously as if it is building slowly and relentlessly into a full-blown crisis. The three legs of the stool that is NHS emergency care – A&E, GPs and ambulance services – are all wobbling dangerously. Emergency departments’ ability to treat the required 95% of patients within four hours has declined sharply in recent weeks, with just 84.7% treated within that time – its worst ever level. Hospital-based A&E units have now missed the 95% target every week for well over a year while patients are spending more time on trolleys in corridors than they should or being shuffled from one A&E to another. GP surgeries are wilting under the strain of increasing demand and too few family doctors. The line of people pictured on the front page of the Daily Mail recently as they queued from 6.30am to get an appointment at their local surgery was a microcosm of a widespread problem. Ambulance services are also wobbling. Three of England’s 10 regional ambulance services are, or very recently have been, on a state of “critical” alert. Like their colleagues elsewhere in the NHS, their capacity to respond quickly enough to genuine medical need is fraying at the edges. In March, London ambulance service reached the target 75% of critically ill patients facing a life or death emergency within the maximum eight-minute response time in all 32 boroughs. By June, it did not manage that in any of them. In some boroughs crews reached just 48% of such patients on time. Surveying the NHS’s decline, one minister said privately: “One of the slightly scary things is that no one, including the best brains in the health system, really knows what’s going on. It’s a complex picture and there’s no one factor.” But one last statistic – that admissions to hospital via A&E have also hit a record high – is the most telling of all. In all 159,054 patients were admitted in the first two weeks of December. That underlines a simple fact: that more people are more unwell than ever before. Paradoxically, while Britain’s healthy life expectancy – the time people live free of disease or disability – is lengthening, it has also never seen more illness. The NHS is visibly struggling to respond to a growing burden of illness, especially given that its ringfenced budget has disguised the fall in health’s overall share of GDP under the coalition, just when rising need made that ill-advised. The ageing population is the main reason. More older people mean more broken bones, more dementia, more infections, more failing hearts and lungs, and much else besides. That trend will only continue. And the problem is compounded in the depths of winter, with colds and vomiting outbreaks common. There are other drivers too, none of which involves an easy remedy. Obesity, drinking and smoking are producing an ever-larger toll of lifestyle-related diseases such as cancer, diabetes and drink-related liver damage. Internal faults developing in the NHS are exacerbating the problem. A heavy price is being paid for the lack of health services outside hospitals to keep people healthier for longer at home – billions of pounds of NHS money have gone into this, with little return. Meanwhile heavy cuts to social care services have followed austerity’s deep cuts to local council budgets. Older and frail people not properly supported at home are more likely to come to grief, end up in hospital and probably need to stay there. When they get to hospital it becomes harder to discharge them without social care to look after them at home. People suffering mental health problems are also adding to the pressures on GPs and A&E units because support is not available in the community, as we report. Meanwhile there is a recruitment crisis in the NHS. Older GPs are retiring early to avoid burnout and too few newly qualified doctors are opting to join general practice. The result is long waits for appointments – meaning patients increasingly use A&E as their first, rather than last, port of call. More and more hospitals are pleading with patients to seek help elsewhere for less serious problems, but to no avail. Attendances keep rising. London ambulance service also says a shortage of paramedics is one reason why it is so stretched. So there is more demand, which means more pressure on increasingly stretched resources and the NHS is in trouble as a result. While we can identify the factors at play no one definitively knows what lies behind the relentless demand for care – or the best way to fix it. Both practically, for patients and NHS staff, and politically in the runup to the general election, this could not be more pressing. As things stand, 2015 will be a very bumpy ride for the country’s most cherished institution.",profile/deniscampbell,Denis,Campbell
23,2015-01-01T08:00:04Z,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/jan/01/miranda-ends-for-good-pratfalls-panache-mixed-farewell,"Miranda's pratfalls have been done with panache, and I will miss them",tv-and-radio,Television & radio,The Guardian,"The final episode of a hit sitcom is usually a lap of honour round the media: The IT Crowd, Friends and Gavin & Stacey were awarded some or all of the traditional valedictory gifts of extended episodes, background documentaries and celebs choosing golden moments.  But there is another sort of show for which the laments of the goodbye back-slappers risk being drowned out by the backlashers holding their own goodbye celebration. In a preview of what will happen to Mrs Brown’s Boys and Derek, this two-faced departure applies to Miranda. Miranda Hart’s self-starring, self-written and self-named comedy will leave TV in a final episode on New Year’s Day.  As Ricky Gervais has shown, it is not unknown for a performer to attract devoted fans and implacable detractors, and Hart at least has the consolation that her howl-mob is smaller than his. The reasons for the enmity are also very different. The controversy over Gervais most often involves suggestions that his performance seems inseparable from his personality and that his combative attitudes in standup and on social media escalate his enemies.  Hart, though, is openly (in the tradition stretching back to Tony Hancock and Mary Tyler Moore) playing a fictional alter ego with the same name on the chequebook and her public declarations, in interviews and on stage, have tended to be shy and anxious. In her case, the complaints of the opposition turn on the alleged retro nature of her comedy, with its reliance on slapstick (clumsy Miranda rarely stays on her feet for a whole show), catchphrases (such as the “what I call a” of the protagonist’s mother, played by Patricia Hodge) and a somewhat soppy romantic subplot, featuring her out-of-sync passion for the handsome Gary. The latter is where she most overlaps with Gervais who, although often accused of bleakness and bad taste, is a closet softy who had a Mills & Boon strand running through The Office, Extras and Derek.   Fans of Miranda – including me – would argue that retro done well is preferable to edgy done badly, and that each of the old-fashioned elements – pratfalls, signature sayings and love story – is handled with panache. And Hart is echoing TV comedy’s past not from conservatism or sloppiness but a scholastic fascination with these conventions. The key to her comedic instincts was a recent Christmas documentary in which Hart profiled Morecambe & Wise, more or less positioning herself as a female reincarnation of Eric: baffled, tactless, gangly. Her trademark direct address to the camera, or sideways glances at it, are also a version of Morecambe’s asides and double takes.  But, though following in a tradition, the show also contains originality, in such painfully funny sequences as Miranda pretending to be on an exotic holiday while staying in a hotel round the corner from her flat, and a weird storyline in which she and her mother are confined in the office of an almost-silent therapist.  Unless Hart changes her mind in the future, her eponymous comedy will consist of 20 episodes, a familiar sort of figure in contemporary British TV. Whereas hit American comedies have often run for a decade or more – partly because standard contracts there include long-term options, and re-run syndication is most lucrative with a large volume of episodes – the younger generation of UK comedians seem increasingly influenced by the example of John Cleese, who halted Fawlty Towers after only two series consisting of 12 episodes. Probably not coincidentally, Ricky Gervais stopped after 14 of The Office and 13 of Extras, while Gavin & Stacey (20) and The IT Crowd (25) also left the audience wanting more.  Another factor is that stars now tend to outgrow their sitcoms very fast. Actors in hit comedies have always done other things: the cast of Dad’s Army and The Good Life were routinely to be found in West End and regional theatres. But a successful peak-time half-hour can now be the foundation for an industry of arena comedy tours, bestselling books and even Hollywood or Broadway careers.  This model was established by Gervais (followed by his Office co-star Martin Freeman), then by Chris O’Dowd and Richard Ayoade of The IT Crowd and James Corden from Gavin & Stacey. And, while Miranda Hart hasn’t yet become a US star, she has accumulated all the other trappings of the portfolio comedian: standup tour (the cannily branded “What I Call My Tour”), books and other TV roles. Symbolically of her business, in a double rare since the days of Ronnie Barker, she appears in two shows back to back on Christmas Day, with the penultimate Miranda immediately succeeded by the tinsel special of Call the Midwife.  Detractors will hope that she metaphorically falls flat on her face with the festive closing episodes; admirers that she literally does so, at least once. But we will also expect more of the verbal and tonal invention that have made Miranda a big deal although, in the way of sitcoms these days, only a small part of Hart’s expanding career.",profile/marklawson,Mark,Lawson
24,2015-01-01T08:00:04Z,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jan/01/rugby-world-cup-2015-tournament-england-triumph,Rugby World Cup 2015: get ready for touchdown,sport,Sport,The Guardian,"Do you remember the frenzy that surrounded England’s rugby World Cup victory in Sydney in 2003? People who had never watched rugby union suddenly began to talk loudly about scrummaging technique. Thousands flocked to Trafalgar Square for the open-top bus parade. The landlord of our local pub even had a parrot that learned to shout “Jonny Wilkinson” at visitors. That’s when you know a sporting event has entered the public consciousness. So just imagine the potential for the nation’s parrots when the 2015 tournament takes place on English – and Welsh – soil in the autumn. Rugby is coming home, as you are sure to hear someone say on ITV in mid-September. It is the sport’s best opportunity in a generation to appeal to those neutrals unsure if Danny Care is a scrum-half or a new-fangled type of medical insurance. As the Olympics in London demonstrated, the country has a half-decent track record when it comes to staging high-profile sports events. It is no coincidence that many of the Locog staff who stage-managed London 2012 are involved again. Tickets to the bigger games have been in huge demand; one study suggests the event will boost the national economy by almost £1bn. Half a million overseas visitors are expected during the 44-day tournament, which features matches at 13 different venues in 11 cities. The Rugby Football Union hopes the tournament will play a part in helping to recruit an extra 25,000 adult players, plus thousands more kids, coaches and volunteers, to the sport in England by 2017. So what could possibly go wrong? Well, that depends on your nationality. Not many Welsh supporters will be broken-hearted if England fail to escape Pool A, where they find themselves, for reasons related to the draw being conducted years prior to the event, alongside Wales and Australia. Even Fiji, the hosts’ opponents in the opening game on the night of Friday 18 September (avoid the A316 through Twickenham if you want to get anywhere before Saturday lunchtime) cannot be entirely discounted. Ireland have a very promising draw and an artful coach in Joe Schmidt. South Africa will take some knocking over; even Scotland are improving this season. It is a rather tighter field than in 2003, when England secured a trophy they were widely tipped to lift, given the presence of all-time greats, including Martin Johnson, Lawrence Dallaglio, Richard Hill, Jason Robinson and Will Greenwood in the same squad. This time there is less certainty. Manu Tuilagi jumping into the Thames can be safely ruled out but, beyond that, no one is entirely sure. Even New Zealand, who will start as tournament favourites, know the margins are narrowing, particularly when they are playing in the northern hemisphere.    England’s Jonny Wilkinson kicking the winning drop goal to clinch the Rugby World Cup in 2003. Photograph: David Davies/PA   England will certainly be well organised under the command of head coach Stuart Lancaster this time. But what continues to elude them, pending a spectacular Six Nations, is the inner confidence to insulate them from the pressures of hosting what is sometimes called the third biggest sporting show on earth after the summer Olympics and the football World Cup. Lancaster hopes passionate home support will bridge the gap, citing the mood on the streets during the Euro 96 football championship as a precedent: “I remember Euro 96 vividly, particularly the sense of identity. We want to try and replicate that emotion and intensity. When I think of England at its best in sport – during Euro 96, or when they’re doing well in the cricket – there is no better feeling.” To that end, Lancaster has set great store in strengthening the bond between the team, its heritage and the country as a whole. If he needs the ideal template, he need only recall the fervid mood in the Millennium Stadium when England were thrashed by Wales in the decisive game of the 2013 Six Nations. England lost a rugby match but it felt as if they had tried – and failed – to take on an entire country. That is precisely the sort of atmosphere Lancaster is hoping will be recreated at Twickenham. “The sense of the country behind the team is a very powerful motivator. We’ll do our best to make sure we deliver in a way that will make the country proud.” If the hosts can top their pool, anything is possible; if not, they may well have to beat South Africa and New Zealand simply to reach the final. Either way, it is time to update our memories of that damp Sydney night in 2003, when Wilkinson’s extra-time drop-goal seemed to hang in mid-air for an eternity. The faces around the stadium at that moment could have inspired an HM Bateman cartoon entitled The Man Who Urinated In The Amber Nectar. Over the ball went and kids are still doing clasp-handed, clench-buttocked Jonny-kicking impersonations now. This is the year to locate some new heroes and give the nation’s parrots some fresh material.  Try this for size New Zealand’s All Blacks are the team to beat and their Sonny Bill Williams is likely to be a crowdpleaser – he’s quick, strong and great at offloading the ball.

Honestly, for the first part, I thought it was rubbish. I put off reading it over Trouble by Non Pratt and Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher. But I was forced to do what I usually do when I don't like the sound of a book, and that's literally to not judge a book by it's cover. My God, I am glad I did. Carey and Jenessa were kidnapped at a young age by their mother and sent to a camper in the middle of a forest they called the Hundred Acre Wood, partly because of their endless upbringing with Winnie the Pooh. They had only their drugged up mother for company and she would often go away for weeks at a time. Carey holds a dreaded secret that could destroy them forever, but if she doesn't tell, it will ruin her future. Then her father comes, and then a whole world comes. INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT NOTICE: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS THAT SADLY I NEED TO DESCRIBE THE BOOK IN THE BEST WAY. SORRY! I found it really fascinating actually how Murdoch managed to explore the adaptations that Carey and Jenessa had to take to adjust to normal life, and the threats that peers can sometimes pose. It gave me the sort of caveman impression. In fact, let's paint the picture for you. You build a time machine, and take modern life back to the cavemen times. These cavemen have just been taken out their environment and thrown into somewhere new and it's your job to teach them how to live your life. That's pretty much Carey and Jenessa. Then you expose these cavemen (Carey and Jenessa) to ugly stepsisters (ugly in a different sense of the word), falling in love with those who you want to keep secret and then someone getting hold of your past you want to forget. Do I have negatives? Firstly, I don't like the cover. It seems like a budget option and it's the reason that I was put off reading this novel for so long! Why do it? This isn't the first book I've had this problem with, but still! Let that be the lesson of that paragraph! Second, I don't like the layout. Parts are old fashioned and the way it's shown is a bit off. Italics confused me between the different parts of the tales that were being told. The fact that the story was told in first person throughout meant that Emily probably wanted flashbacks here and there. The way these were shown was horrible though. If there is a reprint, please sort this! Mainly editorial notes (I seem to like them for whatever reason) though. I really enjoyed this novel and want to read something from Emily Murdoch next. Fantastic work! • Buy this book at the Guardian Bookshop. Want to tell the world about a book you've read? Join the site and send us your review!",,,
27,2015-01-01T09:00:06Z,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/01/challenge-to-old-order-growing,"All over the world, the challenge to the old order is growing",commentisfree,Opinion,The Guardian,"A decade and a half into the 21st century, we’re still living through the aftermath of two epoch-making shocks. The first was the demonstration of the limits of US power in the killing fields of Afghanistan and Iraq – the war on terror that broke the spell of invincibility of the world’s first truly global empire. The second was the financial crash of 2008 and the crisis of the western-dominated economic system it unleashed, still playing havoc with economies and lives across the world more than six years later. That crisis will shape politics in Europe in 2015, from London to Madrid. But the impact will be felt first in Athens. The slump and stagnation that followed the crash has already fuelled the rise of the populist right. Now, after years of self-defeating austerity and falling living standards, the radical left has leapfrogged ahead to challenge for power in the most devastated eurozone economies of Greece and Spain. It was a backlash waiting to happen. In Greece the leftwing Syriza party, which rejects the austerity enforced across the eurozone by its unelected troika, is favourite to win the snap elections called for the end of January. Syriza may have stepped back from its one-time demand for unilateral debt cancellation, its programme to boost living standards in the wake of a 1930s-style depression may be modest, and mainstream voices across Europe may also be calling for a change of direction. But Europe’s governing elites will have none of it. Expect a ferocious campaign to terrify Greek voters, who have already been warned by the European commission’s Jean-Claude Juncker not to vote the “wrong” way. If Greeks still insist on making their own democratic choice, everything will be done to force Syriza to retreat. If all else fails, Greece will be punished for fear that others, such as Spain’s new Podemos party, might go down the same route later in the year. The powers that be in Europe are determined to prop up a failed economic model regardless of the cost – as they will be in Britain if Labour wins the general election in May. The aftershocks of the breakdown of that neoliberal regime are still being felt across the world economy – in falling commodity prices, capital flight, stagnation and recession. But the interests that depend on it won’t let go without a serious challenge. That’s just as true in terms of global power. The US and its satellites, including Britain, may have suffered a strategic defeat in Iraq and Afghanistan – symbolised by last weekend’s ceremony to mark the end of Nato’s combat mission, held in secret for fear of Taliban attacks. But they’re not letting go either. Some 13,000 troops are staying on as “trainers”, just as thousands of western troops have been returning to Iraq for the war against Isis – the al-Qaida breakaway spawned by their own invasion and occupation – with talk of a major assault in the spring. In the same spirit, every effort was made at the time of the Arab uprisings of 2011 to hijack, control or crush them. Some of the results can be seen today in the disaster zone across the Middle East, the growing power of the western-backed autocracies of the Gulf, the brutality of Egypt’s new dictatorship and the maelstrom in post-intervention Libya, whose civil war is likely to intensify in the coming months. Meanwhile, Russia’s challenge to untrammelled US strategic power, which began in Georgia in 2008 and intensified through Syria’s proxy war, has come to a head in the conflict in Ukraine. There has been much western crowing in recent weeks that the combination of collapsing oil prices with US and EU sanctions has plunged Russia into recession, while knocking chunks out of the economies of other independent oil states such as Iran and Venezuela into the bargain. It seems clear enough that the Saudi regime’s decision to boost oil output when prices were already falling was designed not only to protect market share and undercut fracking, but to punish Iran and Russia for their role in the Middle East and Europe to the benefit of Riyadh’s US sponsor. It is a form of economic warfare – hailed by President Obama this week as the fruit of “strategic patience” – the consequences of which will be felt across the world in the months to come. But along with the global power and economic shocks of the past decade, two other crucial shifts have defined the early 21st century: the economic rise of China, in defiance of market orthodoxy, and the tide of progressive change that has swept Latin America, opening up alternatives to neoliberal capitalism. Both have continued despite the backwash from the crash, which has taken its toll on the “Brics” countries and the wider global south. Progressive governments have carried on being elected from Bolivia to Brazil, while China’s slowing growth rate is still almost double that delivered by the US recovery. Political and financial pressure on Venezuela, which has been crucial to Latin America’s transformation and already faces serious economic problems, however, looks set to increase in the coming year. The key to riding the storm, as elsewhere, will be who is made to shoulder the burden of falling income and reform. What seems certain though is that, however much the west tries to recapture lost ground, the global order will not revert to the status quo ante. There may be growing conflict, but there will be no return to unchallenged US diktat or uncontested economic catechisms. Alternative centres of power are forming. Both internationally and domestically, the old order is coming apart. The question will be what replaces it.",profile/seumasmilne,milne,seumas
28,2015-01-01T09:00:06Z,https://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/jan/01/youtube-apocalypse-old-media-struggle-to-understand-web-stars-zoella,YouTube apocalypse: old media still struggle to understand web superstars such as Zoella,technology,Technology,The Guardian,"YouTubers, vloggers and Vine celebrities came above ground in a big way in 2014. However, in the same way that Taylor Swift already seemed pretty successful last January, so last year’s online video action will seem pathetically insignificant by the end of next year. Think of the past 12 months as a feasibility study. For instance, Australian YouTuber Troye Sivan released his first major pop single, which was a worldwide hit, ahead of a full album in 2015. In September, the likes of Zoella, Alfie Deyes and Joe Sugg took Amity Fest on a small tour, explaining that it was simply a test for a much larger event, also due in 2015. In August, Radio 1 – whose job it is to throw itself in the path of any passing youth trend – announced that more YouTubers would join existing crossover stars Dan and Phil on the station’s airwaves, their rotating slot being an ideal testing ground for the station’s future stars. There was housekeeping, too, and using 2014 as a proof of concept allowed boundaries to be established ahead of the takeover that is to begin in earnest. On YouTube, the likes of Sam Pepper were outed as deeply unpleasant people, while established media entities hoping to tap into online video LOLs for some quick and easy #content were given a stark warning when ITV2’s support of Vine-based dipstick Dapper Laughs came to a grizzly end that nobody (except anyone with half a brain) could have seen coming. But as 2014 drew to a close it was the furore surrounding Zoella’s debut novel that most effectively drew the battle lines for 2015. When it emerged that the popular – and unassumingly powerful – YouTuber had worked with a ghostwriter, the traditional media were up in arms. Her 6.8m YouTube subscribers, whose purchases ensured that the novel broke sales records, simply did not care. Zoe and her pals might represent the least diverse group of individuals this side of Stereo Kicks, but they’ve achieved huge success with little support or acknowledgement from the media establishment. During 2015, treatment of the young stars’ endeavours will fall into three camps. First, there are those in the media who will be confused or threatened by what is happening – they will choose to ignore impending YouTuber apocalypse with the same foresight one might employ when ignoring a chip-pan fire. Second, there will be those who are confused or threatened by what is happening, and who will opt to drag the scene through the dirt. That Zoella was pilloried while nobody seemed bothered about whether Joey Essex wrote Being Reem gives some indication of the disdain with which some commentators view YouTube stars, but then Joey Essex is not coming after anyone’s job. Finally, there will be those in the media who follow Radio 1’s lead and attempt to harness the phenomenon. But YouTubers don’t necessarily want to be harnessed. Nor, with audiences bigger than most terrestrial TV broadcasts and brands happy to throw thousands of pounds their way in an attempt to connect with teenage audiences, do they need to be. You might not read much about 2015’s biggest media trend, but what the over-20s do encounter will be the tip of an extremely fast-moving iceberg. Everything else will be happening in secret, to an audience of tens of millions.",profile/peterrobinson,robinson,peter

When I was an only child transplanted to landlocked Indiana from the shores of southern Maryland in the United States – a torture akin to, say, moving to Mars – I discovered Judy Blume. In Maryland, I had danced and painted and written stories. I didn’t play team sports and I wasn’t blond and petite and a cheerleader like the girls at my Indiana school. I never learned to cartwheel because I didn’t like being upside down. Judy Blume’s characters, more than my own parents, knew how I felt, what I thought, what I feared. In high school, I graduated to the Brontë sisters, whose dark, dramatic longing spoke to my ongoing sense of displacement.      Photograph: theguardian.com   Books reach into the darkest, loneliest parts of us and remind us it’s okay. I wrote All the Bright Places because I once knew and loved a boy. And then I lost him, and it changed my life. But I wasn’t sure anyone would understand me if I talked about it, so I wrote about it instead, knowing there are others like him, like me, who need to know that it gets better, help is out there, high school isn’t forever, and life is long and vast and full of joy. Whether dealing with loss, mental illness, suicide, addiction, bullying, self-harm, rape, or the feeling of not fitting in, young adult authors are addressing the deepest, darkest issues, and reminding us what it means to live. Here are ten lovely, tough, honest, and ultimately life-affirming books: 1. I’ll Give You the Sun by Jandy Nelson       Photograph: theguardian.com   Jude and Noah are twins. Artistic Noah is bullied and isolated. He’s also in love with the boy next door. Bold, outgoing Jude has sworn off boys forever. Three years later, the twins are broken and barely speaking. Noah has given up art and taken up cliff-diving, and brave Jude is paralyzed with fear. The early years are told from Noah’s point of view, while 16-year-old Jude narrates the current day. We know they’ve suffered a tragedy, but we have to rely on these two to separately and cumulatively reveal what happened. I’ll Give You the Sun is a vibrant, sparkling story that reminds you to follow your heart, face your fears, and live the life you were meant to live. 2. The Outsiders by SE Hinton       Photograph: theguardian.com   This classic, first published in 1967, is the bestselling young adult book of all time. It tells the story of Ponyboy, a greaser, or outsider, who lives in a world of us versus them. The “us” here are the outsiders, the “them” are those with money, otherwise known as the “Socs,” or “Socials.” The Socs beat up greasers for sport, but one tragic night, Ponyboy and his fellow greasers take their revenge, and someone is killed. The novel is as powerful today as it was forty-some years ago, and its message – being judged by what you are instead of who you are, and overcoming circumstance and prejudice – is timeless. 3. Fat Kid Rules the World by KL Going       Photograph: theguardian.com   When we first meet Troy Billings, he is standing on the edge of a New York City subway platform contemplating suicide. At 296 pounds, the 17-year-old is friend less and, recently, motherless. Part-time high school student and punk-rock guitarist Curt MacCrae comes to the rescue and saves his life. The result is an unlikely friendship, with the troubled, drug addicted MacCrae inviting Troy to join his band. The book is a rollicking, moving celebration of acceptance, diversity, new beginnings, self-discovery, and the outsider in all of us. 4. Saving Daisy by Phil Earle       Photograph: theguardian.com   Before he became an author, Phil Earle had a job as a care worker in a children’s home. There, he met people like Daisy, whose mother is dead and whose father has closed himself away. Daisy blames herself for her mum’s death, and tries to become invisible at school to escape notice. It’s a gritty story – Daisy struggles with self-harm and a second tragedy, which leaves her completely alone. Earle tackles bullying and depression, but in the end the book is about learning to live, and it’s Daisy who is finally responsible for her recovery. 5. Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson      Photograph: theguardian.com   There’s a reason why Speak is so beloved. Few YA novels are as powerfully affirming in their message: find your voice and use it. High school freshman Melinda is an outcast in the aftermath of a single incident – she busted an end-of-summer party by calling the cops. She finds herself isolated and turned on not only by her classmates but by her closest friends. As the isolation grows more pronounced, she finally stops speaking, and only through work on an art project is she able to face what really happened at the party. Melinda represents too many alienated, victimized teens, and when she at last finds her voice, it makes you want to find and use your own. Loudly. 6. Before I Die by Jenny Downham       Photograph: theguardian.com   Tessa is 17 and dying of cancer. Instead of shutting down and waiting for the inevitable, she creates a list of things to do before she dies: have sex, say yes to everything and everyone for an entire day, try drugs, fall in love. Her parents are separated, her dad hovers, her mom is estranged. Tessa struggles with depression, falls in love with the boy next door, and discovers what it really means to be alive. Downham’s prose is exquisite, and her poignant story breaks your heart at the same time it makes you grateful for even the smallest moments. Like another very famous teen cancer novel, it’s actually more about life than death. 7. It’s Kind of a Funny Story by Ned Vizzini      Photograph: theguardian.com   Craig Gilner always thought he was brilliant and exceptional. Until he’s accepted at Manhattan’s elite Executive Pre-Professional High School, where he finds out he’s actually pretty average. Life as he’s always known it is over – suddenly his perfectly planned future seems improbable, maybe impossible. Craig stops eating and sleeping. And he tries to kill himself. He’s so rattled by the near-death experience, he checks himself into a mental hospital, where he attempts to put the pieces of himself and his life back together. Ned Vizzini tragically died of suicide in 2013, but what he’s created on these pages is a reassuringly funny, human, and touching tale of hope. 8. The Beginning of Everything by Robyn Schneider       Photograph: theguardian.com   Ezra Faulkner has it all – he’s junior class president, varsity tennis champion, and he drives a BMW. He’s even dating the most popular girl in school. Until she cheats on him. And then, the weekend before his junior prom, Ezra is brutally injured in a hit-and-run accident, which turns his entire life upside down. For Ezra, it’s the end and the beginning of everything. He meets new girl Cassidy Thorpe, who has her own scars to bear, and he is forced to face who he was, who he’s expected to be, and who he’s going to become. As Cassidy says to Ezra, “Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?” Inspiring. 9. Stargirl by Jerry Spinelli       Photograph: theguardian.com   Susan Caraway is better known as Stargirl. She’s the eccentric new girl at a high school that prizes conformity. She’s kind to everyone – remembering birthdays with songs and cards – dresses colourfully (kimonos, pioneer dresses), plays the ukulele, dances even where there isn’t any music. Sixteen-year-old narrator Leo Borlock doesn’t understand her any more than anyone else does, but he falls hard for her. When he finds himself alienated from his classmates because of it, he tries to change Stargirl, who becomes a cheerleader and sheds her magical nickname for “Susan.” It’s a sweet, haunting book about being true to who you are in spite of everything and everyone else. 10. Wonder by RJ Palacio       Photograph: theguardian.com   Although it’s technically a middle grade book, Wonder speaks to anyone of any age who’s ever felt alone. I won’t describe what I look like. Whatever you’re thinking, it’s probably worse. Those are the words of fifth grader August “Auggie” Pullman, who was born with a facial difference. This is his first year in a mainstream school, and what he wants most is to be treated like any other kid. Except that his classmates, unable to get past his face, see him as a freak. RJ Palacio describes her book as “a meditation on kindness,” and it is. But Auggie and Wonder will not only make you “choose kind,” they will remind you that it’s oh-so important to stand out.

But truth be told, the region is more unstable, more conflicted and more unpredictable than at any time in recent history. The hazards posed by this violent volatility are global in reach and rapidly intensifying. They menace us all, although, as is the case now, Muslims and most particularly Arabs will bear the brunt in the coming year. It looked different six years ago, after Barack Obama came to power promising a resolution of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In a celebrated speech in Cairo in June 2009, Obama promoted “a new beginning” with the Muslim world “based upon mutual interest and mutual respect”. The west and Islam need not be in competition, he said. “This cycle of suspicion and discord must end.” It never happened. Differences deepened in the ensuing years, the Arab spring – and the west’s ambivalent response – revolutionised regional dynamics, and the gulf of distrust identified by Obama widened dramatically. Many in the Middle East blame this chronic state of affairs on continuing foreign (meaning western) intervention. Yet, conversely, increased foreign intervention – military, diplomatic, financial and humanitarian – may now be the best and perhaps only way of tackling the multiple, connected crises in Syria, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Israel-Palestine and north Africa. Pressure on the western powers to get more directly involved may increase exponentially in the next 12 months. This could bring the region to boiling point. Of course, it could all work out for the best. More likely, 2015 will be the Middle East’s year of breaking bad. The jihadist threat    The aftermath of a suicide attack carried out by Islamic State in northern Iraq. Photograph: Safin Hamed/AFP/Getty Images   The biggest single danger, by some measures at least, is that the threat posed by Islamic State (Isis) jihadi terrorists to the political and geographical integrity of Iraq, including the southern oil-fields and the energy-rich Kurdish region, will provoke another full-blooded US military intervention, including the return of significant numbers of combat troops. Obama has repeatedly ruled out putting “boots on the ground”. But he is politically weakened and will face a hostile rightwing Congress in 2015. Obama has already sent some troops back to Iraq, and has left himself wiggle-room to send more, including the option to widen the fight beyond Iraq and Syria. The Pentagon and America’s generals agree air strikes alone cannot defeat Isis. Regional allies, Kurds excepted, show no sign of providing surrogate ground forces in either Iraq or Syria, where Isis has its strongholds. Various manifestations of Sunni extremism, represented by groups such as the al-Qaida-linked al-Nusra Front, threaten a spreading, contagious destabilisation of Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey and worsening, linked security crises in Libya, Yemen and Somalia. If the US does escalate its military involvement in 2015, Britain will face pressure to follow suit – in what could become, in effect, the third Iraq war. Isis has already threatened retaliatory attacks on the home soil of countries in the US-led coalition. The presence of foreign jihadis in its ranks, including hundreds from Britain and Europe, make another 7/7-style terrorist atrocity more feasible. Britain’s security services know this, hence their current “severe” threat alert. The Isis threat is rendered more formidable by several factors. One is its propaganda skills and astute use of modern media platforms. Another is the group’s readiness, ever more pronounced, to ignore mainstream Islamic teaching and interpretations of the Qu’ran. No matter how strenuously the top muftis condemn beheadings or rape, they are contemptuously ignored. The bigger context framing this failure of religious and moral leadership is the “war” within Islam between Sunnis and Shias, which in theory pits Pakistan and the Gulf Arab monarchies led by Saudi Arabia against Shia-led Iran, Lebanon’s Hizbullah, and their Alawite allies in the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad. The continued financing by wealthy Qataris and Saudis of Isis and jihadist groups in the wider Middle East and north Africa is another aspect of the Sunni-Shia schism, of which the terrorists are direct beneficiaries. Meanwhile, jihadist violence overall is taking an ever bigger toll, according to recent research. More than 5,000 people died worldwide last November. The Isis insurrection is the linear successor of the al-Qaida-led Sunni insurrection in Iraq in the mid-2000s, only this time it spans more than one country. US general David Petraeus’s famous troop “surge” was needed to defeat Sunni extremism in 2007. Obama and allies may decide something similar is required in 2015. The Syrian catastrophe    Displaced Syrian children in a camp on the border with Turkey. Photograph: Baraa Al-Halabi/AFP/Getty Images   Syria’s civil war will enter its fifth year in 2015. The human cost is appalling, and rising. About 200,000 people have died. More than 3 million refugees have fled to Turkey, Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan. About 6.5 million people are internally displaced. There is no peace process to speak of. Fighting continues unchecked. The UN, launching its biggest ever aid appeal for 2015, says it can no longer feed many refugees. This situation is unsustainable. While that has been said before, 2015 may be the year when something finally breaks. Syria has been called Europe’s equivalent of the Rwanda genocide – and as was the case in Rwanda, not nearly enough is being done to help. Fewer than 150,000 Syrians have been granted asylum in the EU. Most member states, including Britain, are shutting out all but a handful. Of 33,000 new asylum places in 2015, 85% will be in Germany. The remainder mostly prefers to send humanitarian aid, but this, too, is insufficient, given the scale of the catastrophe. Syria’s neighbouring countries, their resources stretched beyond limit, are wilting under the strain. In Lebanon, there are fears that 2015 could bring social breakdown, an upsurge in sectarian tensions, even a return to the civil war that tore the country apart in the 1980s. A trigger could be further cross-border spillovers of factional fighting, as happened last October. Jordan faces similarly unsupportable strains. The UN maintains there are 640,00 Syrians in the country. The government says the true figure is double that. Demand for water, electricity and food supplies vastly outstrips supply. Domestic rents have soared, health and education systems are overwhelmed. There are no jobs for young people. The story is much the same in Turkey, although, as a much larger country, it has more capacity to cope. Like Israel’s leadership, the Ankara government of President Tayyip Erdoğan reviles the Assad regime. Both countries have engaged in sporadic clashes in recent months with Syrian forces. This risk of a wider conflict is exacerbated by determined Iranian backing for Assad, who knows he is in a fight to the death, and Syria’s ongoing support for extremist Palestinian elements, whose primary target is Israel. Worse still, in a way, is the possibility that Assad actually does fall from power. The ensuing, likely descent into internal anarchy, and the permanent break-up of Syria as a distinct sovereign entity, could presage even greater horrors. Wild cards    Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu: in talks with Iran over its nuclear programme. Photograph: Jim Hollander/EPA   The Middle East in 2015 features several other dangerous tripwires that could tip the region into sudden chaos. The most obvious is the standoff over Iran’s suspect nuclear programme, which Israel regards as an existential threat. Long-running talks again ended without agreement in November. A new deadline of July, 2015 has been set. Opinions differ whether a deal can be reached. If it is, Iran could come in from the cold for the first time since 1979. If not, the possibility that Israel, led by prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu, will take matters into its own hands and launch military strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities is very real indeed. Whether that happens depends, to some extent, on the outcome of general elections in Israel in March. Netanyahu, the conservative Likud leader, is fighting a centre-left bloc led by former foreign minister Tzipi Livni and Isaac Herzog. The poll will offer Israelis a real ideological choice. Rightwing extremists “are turning this country into an isolated, closed and alienated state”, Livni said in December. The future of stalled negotiations with the Palestinians, and the avoidance of a much-predicted “third intifada” in 2015, also partly rests on the result of the poll. The stability of Egypt, where the military-dominated regime that ousted the elected Muslim Brotherhood continues to crush political dissent, is another key question. So, too, is growing neo-Islamist authoritarianism in Turkey, now seen less and less as a reliable western ally. The slow-motion disintegration of post-Gaddafi Libya, beset by rival governments and warring militias, is an explosive problem all by itself. Upheavals there could have a knock-on effect in Sudan, which is also entering an election year. Highly relevant, in this frenetic context, is the strength of leadership and vision shown by western leaders who, for whatever reason, may seek in 2015 to intervene to save the Middle East from itself. After his mid-term poll humiliation, Obama is in many ways a busted flush. David Cameron faces a May election that could consign him to political oblivion. François Hollande in France and Angela Merkel in Germany may soon be pre-occupied by a new eurozone crisis and more trouble with Vladimir Putin’s Russia. If the Middle East breaks bad in a big way in 2015, increased foreign intervention may ultimately be deemed impractical and unwise. “Sauve qui peut” – save yourself if you can – could become the guiding principle for the west’s weakened and blundering leaders.",profile/simontisdall,Simon,Tisdall

Pollock was a reference for Alexander McQueen’s spring/summer 1999 catwalk show, in which two robots fired paint onto a dress being worn by Shalom Harlow.

The 45-year-old evangelical preacher from the Nuer community has just made the three-hour walk from the banks of the Baro river, where he tends to his large family’s small plot of corn. His daughters are preparing cabbage and cobs to be cooked on an open fire. In the opposite direction, across the asphalt road that leads to South Sudan, lies the farm of BHO Bioproducts, an Anglo-Indian company growing rice and cotton on the 27,000 hectares (67,000 acres) it has leased. Pouch says the company doesn’t care about the people of his village, Wath-Gach. Grazing land has been lost, and BHO has built a wooden cage around a water pump to prevent locals using it. “From the beginning we did not have a good relationship,” he says. “It was given without consultation. There has been lots of negative impact.” The company didn’t respond to a request for comment.    Harvesting rice at Saudi Star’s farm investment in Gambella. The company says it is trying to ensure that local communities benefit from the operation. Photograph: William Davison   BHO’s operation, which began in 2010, is one of many concessions Ethiopia’s government has granted in Gambella, including one plot leased to the Indian company Karuturi Global of 100,000 hectares. Commercial farmers are expected to bring knowhow, technology and jobs to one of the country’s poorest and most remote regions. By converting uncultivated bush into productive farms, officials believed food security and export revenues would improve in a country dominated by subsistence agriculture. But despite those worthy ambitions, progress has been hampered by Gambella’s logistical difficulties, and a failure to ensure local communities benefit. The village of Ilea is home to people from Gambella’s other main indigenous group, the Anuak. It’s also been the headquarters of Karuturi’s operation for the past five years. In the village, a group of men shelter from the afternoon heat, passing round a tobacco waterpipe. Behind them, women draw water from a well built by the government. Karuturi’s project has stalled after managers discovered that four-fifths of the land is in a floodplain. The firm also failed to build relations with residents, according to the elders. Complaints include reduced land for farming and hunting, no promised health clinic, cattle dying from ingesting pesticides, the burning of unwanted maize, and only a handful of jobs for villagers. “The government benefits from the tax but the community does not benefit,” says Obang Wudo, one of the elders.    Jakob Pouch says his community in Gambella hasn’t benefited from a nearby commercial farm. Photograph: William Davison   The gripes of Ilea’s residents about Karuturi are compounded by their concerns about nearby land parcelled out to Ethiopian investors from outside Gambella. They say they frequently lobby the regional government to act, but nothing has been done. That region’s president, Gatluak Tut Khot, expresses support for investors engaged in “very difficult work”. The regional government can’t force companies to pay more, he explains, but his administration has held meetings to improve relations. “They have to respect the interests of the community and those who need jobs from them,” he says. Gambella has been the focus of a political fallout between the central government and advocacy groups such as Human Rights Watch and the Oakland Institute – with donors uncomfortably positioned in the middle. The critics claim that a resettlement programme to move scattered rural populations to larger settlements was coercive and designed to clear the way for investors. Ethiopia says rights groups from the global north are ideologically opposed to its state-heavy development model and that the voluntary resettlement programme was to make public service delivery more cost-efficient. The UK’s Department for International Development and the World Bank are facing legal inquiries for funding the salaries of civil servants who staffed the enlarged villages. Bikrum Gill is studying the impact of Indian investors on Gambella’s people for his doctorate, with a specific focus on Karuturi. He found that locals had hoped to access more food and better farming technologies, but were often disappointed. Instead, communities lost land and flooding worsened. Speaking specifically about the Karuturi investment, Gill says: “It’s difficult to ascertain, what, if any, benefits this project has brought to affected local people.”  Karuturi farm managers at the site referred inquires to the company’s head office, which didn’t respond to attempts to contact it. One farmer from Ethiopia’s highlands, who did not want to be named, tells a different story. He thinks the wave of commercial farming will transform an economic backwater. “They were sitting on the side of the riverbank,” he says about locals. “If investors are coming, their life has changed, they are operators, technicians.” He pays 50 birr (about £1.60) a day – above the average for manual labour in Ethiopia – and provides transport for his workers. Eight houses have been built for teachers, he says, and 25 hectares cleared for the community to plough. Some larger enterprises are also reaching out. At the request of the regional administration, Saudi Star Agricultural Development’s four-year-old rice farm in another part of the region has hired 40 local professionals, while district governments will each get two tractors for young people to use.  “We know we’re creating job opportunities, transforming skills, training locals,” says the firm’s chief executive, Jemal Ahmed. “The community has to profit from the project and we have social responsibility.” He is fully aware of local sensitivities about the company’s work. The farm, bankrolled by Ethiopian-born Saudi billionaire Mohammed al-Amoudi, was attacked by gunmen two years ago and has been criticised as a land-grab. Ahmed says no one was displaced from Saudi Star’s 10,000 hectares, which were earmarked in the late 1980s by the previous government for large-scale agriculture. “It’s not part of any villagisation, it’s not been grabbed – that’s a fact,” he says. “But people who have their own agenda, – Oakland Institute and Human Rights Watch – fabricated stories and campaigned against this project.” Gill says part of the problem is that investors are “not seeing the people on the land … It precludes the possibility of engaging with locals. To succeed you have to build out of local diversity and knowledge.”",profile/william-davison,davison,william
33,2015-01-01T09:00:06Z,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/01/comfort-soups-nostalgia-in-bowl-magic-medicine,Comfort soups: nostalgia in a bowl or magic medicine?,food,Food,The Guardian,"There’s a chill in the air, the usual coughs and colds have started to make the rounds, the scarves are out and the idea of salad for lunch is a long-distant memory. Celebrate all ye lovers of the warming and fulfilling lunch: it’s full-blown soup season. Whether it’s because the weather has turned or because you’re feeling under the weather, a hot bowl of steaming soup can provide solace, and no doubt you have a clear idea of what your own ultimate comfort soup is. At a guess, it’s probably influenced more by what your mum made you when you were little than the potential health benefits. But some would argue that the soups we turn to for digestive consolation are much more than just nostalgia in a bowl. Instead, perhaps they’re centuries of received wisdom and hedge-medicine distilled into soup form and culturally enshrined. Is it possible to put your finger on what makes classic winter soups like chicken soup, miso soup and daal so nourishingly good? Mark Ogus, the brains behind Jewish street-food stall Monty’s Deli, Japanese chef Yuki Gomi, who’s worked with Miso Tasty, and Selina Periampillai from the Taste Mauritius supper club each state their case for their favourite. Mark Ogus – chicken soup Chicken soup is one of the obvious infusions for the peely-wally. “It’s so good,” says Ogus. “Growing up in a Jewish family, your grandmother’s and your mother’s chicken soup was this mysterious wonderful thing. We love it, although we don’t know why it’s so good.” The secret to good chicken soup is fiercely guarded, and everyone has their own version. Traditionally, it’s a fixture starting Friday night’s dinner in Jewish households. “It has a smell that gives me a hit of nostalgia and makes me feel instantly comforted,” says Ogus. There’s more to it than nostalgia, though. Broths made from bones are a good source of amino acids. “You boil off the impurities to make something delicious, and there’s something satisfying about making things out of bones and gristle.” Of course, you don’t need to be Jewish to favour chicken soup. “Chicken is a ubiquitous meat that even people who don’t like meat much will eat. You use the carcass, and when everyone’s feeling hard up it feels good that you’re not wasting anything. It’s a very traditional way of getting the most out of your food.” Yuki Gomi – miso soup    An inviting bowl of miso soup. Photograph: Alamy   In Japan, a bowl of miso soup is what makes everything better. “It’s mummy food,” says Gomi. “Every time I have miso soup it feels like home. Whether in Japan or away, even the smell of miso soup reminds Japanese people of their mummy.” Miso is a core Japanese ingredient, made from fermented beans and then mixed, depending on the region, with rice, wheat or beans. “Where I’m from in Yamanashi prefecture, near Mount Fuji, our miso is made from a mix of rice and wheat and is quite pale. We use the paste to make hōtō noodle miso soup with thick, handmade wheat noodles, mushrooms and pumpkin, slow-cooked for a long time. You eat it in a big bowl and it’s really good.” Like lots of fermented foods, miso is rich in amino acids and complex proteins. The fermentation process also means miso contains lots of probiotics, making it easy to digest. “My grandmother’s generation had miso all the time, as much as we drink tea in Britain. I learned how to make it from her and from my mother, but once you’ve got the basics you can use different miso soups as a base and add in whatever you feel like: pork belly for energy and extra-rich flavour; root vegetables for the comfort of carbohydrates. There are no rules.” Selina Periampillai – daal    Felicity Cloake’s perfect dal. Photograph: Felicity Cloake   “In autumn and winter I make daal at least once a week,” says Periampillai. “It’s a really substantial meal, a warm bowl to have when the weather’s like this. It’s quite like a soup, but more robust than those other, watery soups.” Daal is a staple in Indian and Mauritian cooking, consisting of lentils of all kinds boiled down into a mush that’s seasoned with spice. “There are so many different types of daal. I like chana daal, yellow split peas flavoured with turmeric and salt, boiled and blended smooth. I cook up onion, garlic, ginger, chilli and curry leaves in olive oil and mix it in afterwards. When the weather is cold outside and I need something warming, it’s great. And it’s healthy.” A lot of the spices used in daal are linked to ayurvedic remedies. “Turmeric is an anti-inflammatory, and garlic, chilli and ginger are all traditionally linked to warding off colds and illnesses.” Like miso, there are different kinds of daal, and there’s no rules about what you add. “It’s really versatile – at this time of year I add kale, pumpkin and squash, but you can add roast veggies, toasted cumin, spinach or caramelised onions. I sometimes stir in coconut milk to make it feel really indulgent.” What do you think? Are comfort soups merely nostalgia in a bowl, or is there some nutritional basis in what we choose to eat when we’re under the weather? What do you like to fill a bowl with when you’re wrapped up under blankets at home?",,,
34,2015-01-01T09:39:58Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/01/manchester-united-consider-aston-villa-ron-vlaar-transfer,Manchester United consider Aston Villa’s Ron Vlaar for potential transfer,football,Football,The Guardian,"Ron Vlaar is under consideration by Louis van Gaal as the Manchester United manager seeks to strengthen his defensive options, though there is yet to be any contact with Aston Villa regarding the player. Vlaar’s experience and pedigree has made him a potential target for Van Gaal, with the 29-year-old Dutchman in a third Premier League campaign at Villa while being a seasoned Holland international who impressed during the 2014 World Cup. Vlaar was managed in Brazil by Van Gaal and, with the Villa captain out of contract in the summer, he would represent a comparatively cheap transfer if the manager did decide to move for him in the January window, which opens on Saturday. While making any signing in January inevitably forces the price of a player up, Villa will be conscious that Vlaar could leave for nothing in the close season, as he is understood to be reluctant to agree fresh terms. Van Gaal’s inaugural campaign at United has been plagued by injuries, particularly in defence where Chris Smalling, Jonny Evans, Phil Jones, and Marcos Rojo, the manager’s four frontline centre-backs, have all been ruled out at various times. This has exasperated Van Gaal, who is continuing to try and address the issue.   Related: Manchester United identify Everton’s Seamus Coleman as transfer target   It also now unlikely that the 63-year-old will take his squad away this month for a warm-weather break unlike Manchester City, who are to fly to Abu Dhabi on 18 or 19 January to play Hamburg on 21 January in a friendly. If Van Gaal was to decide on a break it is likely he would only do so if United had been knocked out of the FA Cup and had a free weekend when returning, the scenario in which the club travelled to Dubai in February last season under his predecessor David Moyes.",profile/jamiejackson,jackson,jamie
35,2015-01-01T10:00:07Z,https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/jan/01/picture-books-stories-images-pre-literate-children,"Just-picture books don’t need 1,000 words to be worthwhile",books,Books,The Guardian,"The idea of wordless picture books might seem slightly baffling – even a waste of time – to adults keen to draw children higher up the literacy ladder. But the best just-picture books require a deeper, more intent commitment from the adult who shares them than the well-worn story whose words patter from grown-up lips without pause for thought. For me, leafing through a wordless or near–wordless book in the company of a curious child prevents my mind detaching and wandering off to check the stove. Perverse as it seems, the fewer words, the more entirely present I am as reader.  Children, too, are adept at spotting the nuances of meaning in wordless books; often more so than adults, since they’re accustomed to transporting themselves deep into the small worlds opened up by a picture book’s panels. The playing field is not simply levelled – it now favours the sharp-eyed and imaginative spinner of wild yarns, meaning the pre-literate child will usually win over their word-bound elders. Just-picture books also welcome children who struggle with reading, or find it boring or intimidating. What draws me to them most strongly, though, are the subtleties of emotion that words can’t capture simply enough for a child to understand, but that images can, and do. Here I Am by Patti Kim and Sonia Sanchez, which will be published here by Curious Fox in February, is a brilliant evocation of a boy’s confusion and fear as he leaves his old home and settles in the bewildering new environment of New York. From the first page, in which we see him peering glumly from an aircraft window down at the darkly bustling city, then passing airport signs which spell out strident gibberish, we share his sense of profound alienation. His resolutely smiling parents can’t make a dent in his depression; nothing does, until he drops the cherished red seed he’s brought with him as a talisman from home, and is obliged to go out into his baffling, colourful new world to retrieve it, making friends, and sense of the city, as he does so. Like Shaun Tan’s The Arrival , Here I Am does a superlative job of conveying the immigrant’s yearning to belong, to shuffle together the new and old cards of identity into a coherent pack. The three words of the title on the last page, floating above the boy’s reflection in a pool of Monet-green water, are both an affirmation and a satisfying full stop. Aaron Becker’s Caldecott-winner Journey is another silent beauty, in which a bored, lonely little girl draws a doorway on her bedroom wall and emerges into a lantern-lit forest; then she draws a boat and sails down a river into a soaring city, full of playful steampunk touches and intricately imagined architecture. But it’s not the tense storyline, in which she must rescue a purple bird from an evil emperor, that grips the reader closest – although the plot is taut and well-conceived – it’s the tender, subtle touches which evoke her emotions, unique but instantly recognisable, on every page of the book.   Journey by Aaron Becker  Magical companions pair especially well with wordless picture books – this is a theme that won’t date, so long as children invent adventures and comrades-in-adventure for themselves. I loved Raymond Briggs’s The Snowman as a child; 30 years later, the copy in my daughter’s school library is worn to tatters, and only rarely seen on the shelf. Briggs’s wordless gift is in the everyday detail of dressing gown, slippers and clothes-horse, which makes the intrusion of the extraordinary – the snowman turning to greet the boy, the impossible leap into the cold air – somehow well-earned, and still more breathtaking.    No prints in The Snowman by Raymond Briggs Photograph: PA   Just-picture books can also be dryly hilarious and full of challenge. I thought my pre-literate daughter would be baffled by David Wiesner’s near-wordless Mr Wuffles!  – a miniature epic about a spoilt cat who rejects his owner’s toys in favour of war with the ants and ladybirds inhabiting the crannies of his home. When a tiny spaceship crash-lands there, however, Mr Wuffles is tail-flickingly delighted to pursue the aliens instead. The aliens’ alliance with the ants, their ladybird-borne flight, the curious languages – dots for the ants, triangles for the aliens – in which they speak, and the ultimate escape of the spaceship, has enraptured both of us. It’s fetched out again and again, with both of us making new discoveries every time.   Mr Wuffles!  The biggest ideas, too, are sometimes best conveyed in the fewest words. Jeannie Baker’s Window uses a single framing image throughout: a window on to a wilderness, with a mother and baby looking out of it. The view changes as the birthday cards on the windowsill chart the child’s age, moving towards adulthood – and the wilderness changes, little by little, to developed land, until the grown child moves to a new home and a new window with his own baby, to look out on a new wilderness. But there is already a shiny city encroaching on the corner of this one, and a sign reading “House Blocks for Sale”. A gentle, but urgent reminder, rather than a strident harangue, this endlessly absorbing book guides the reader to remember that small, apparently benevolent actions can coalesce, all of a sudden, into huge ineradicable change.

36,2015-01-01T10:00:07Z,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/jan/01/six-resolutions-for-aid-workers,Six resolutions for aid workers,working-in-development,Working in development,The Guardian," It’s that time again! Our opportunity to reflect on the year and commit to concrete goals for improvement in 2015. I’ve been thinking of simple changes that development workers can make that are good for them and for their work. These are not radical suggestions, but if practiced earnestly, I think they truly can improve an aid worker’s performance as well as an organization’s impact. No excuses this year! 1. Be the best manager ever.  Too often, supervision evolves to nothing more than signing forms, dealing with HR issues, and barking out orders. But helping people learn and grow is at the root of what development should be about. In 2015, I am going to commit to making time for discussions about growth, giving feedback, understanding people’s goals, and guiding them. The world needs more changemakers and inspired leaders, and we can help cultivate them.  2.  Read.  How often do you get an email with an article that sounds really interesting, that just sits in your inbox unopened for months? It’s hard to find time for reading at work, but it’s dangerous to spend all your time focused just on the work you’re doing. There are hundreds of smart people working on development from all sides - research, implementation, policy, and more - and it’s likely that you and your organisation can benefit significantly from what else is out there. Find 20 minutes a day to skim through key blogs or publications that relate to your work, and better yet, encourage others to do the same. For those that prefer books, Bill Gates posts his reading list and so do I! 3.  Write.  On the whole, development workers fail at knowledge management (institutionalising the experiences, relationships, and information about past and present activities). Everything seems to exist in someone’s head, but never on paper. This greatly reduces our ability to learn from each other, or even from the history of our own organization! Cultivate a practice of documentation. Schedule an hour each month to sit down and write down key learnings on a new project.  Focus on questions including: What failed? What improvements have you made? What surprised you? What is working and why? How would you improve it if given the opportunity? Share it with others that you think can benefit from your insights, and encourage them to share their own reflections. A private blog can work well for this, but an email chain is a great way to get started. I’ve written about effective ways my team tries to collectively learn and write. 4. Spend more time in the field.   All of us believe that spending time in the community and talking with clients is valuable, but somehow it finds itself as a last priority. Meetings, conferences, seminars, and other responsibilities stack up, and before you know it months have passed since you went out to the field. But in many ways, these visits are the most clarifying and enlightening experiences you can have. So set a goal for yourself--a number of days that you’ll spend engaging with clients and frontline staff. Talk about your target with your boss as well, so that you have her support and can prioritize it. 5. Walk the walk.  So many organisations doing great work expect employees to work themselves to the bone under tough conditions. Unfortunately a good number of organizations fail to establish or blatantly violate standard employee benefits or expectations, in areas including maternity leave, sexual harassment, and even regular payment schedules. Why should development workers be expected to work for sub-standard employers in the name of the larger mission that they serve? Increasingly, I believe that organizations need to exemplify the change that they are trying to make in society--the behavior and attitude changes that they are encouraging others to adopt, as well as high ethical and moral standards. Alignment between organisational practices and stated goals undoubtedly increases staff commitment and probably effectiveness in spreading messages to others, both at home and formally.  What compromises do you see in your own leadership or organization’s policies? How can you change them? Even if you’re not part of the leadership team, you can change your own behavior, raise awareness among your colleagues about the issue, and potentially approach HR and your own supervision to try and stimulate more discussions at the top. It can start with little issues, like ensuring that everyone washes their hands after going to the bathroom, or conversations, such as asking other staff about the organization’s values and what they mean. Commit to noticing instances where your organisation’s internal values don’t reflect its values in its work and speak up about them regularly. 6.  Renew yourself.  Development work can be stressful, intense, and at times overwhelming. It’s easy to burn out, especially if you find yourself putting in long hours and a lot of emotional investment into your work. Burned-out staff are not particularly productive or happy. There’s a lot of research that shows that carving out even small bits of time (20-30 minutes) for renewing activities--listening to music you love, going for a walk, reading poetry, or spending time with a loved one--can help you maintain your energy and passion over time. What else? I’d love to hear other ideas that are out there, goals you have for 2015, and how accomplishing them will yield rewards to you, your organization and the world.

In March, the #nomakeupselfie campaign emerged and raised £8m for Cancer Research UK in six days. In August, the #icebucketchallenge – where, you guessed it, people threw buckets of ice and water over themselves all in the name of charity – raised £7m for MNDAssociation.  Charities of all sizes have tried to harness social media to fundraise – some more successfully than others. But what is coming next? What will be the next social media phenomenon? Our experts share their predictions; tweet us your ideas @GdnVoluntary, or post them in the comments below.  1. #Growvember by Naomi Marek, chief executive at Sky Badger For me, Movember is a bit out of date. So, how about us girlies getting hairy? #Growvember could be a competitive leg hair growing month. A winter month, obviously, to allow opaque tights for first dates and black tie shindigs.  2. Vlogging for good by Kirsty Marrins, content and community manager at JustGiving I predict that 2015 will be the year of successful charity and celebrity vlogger collaborations. Back in 2012, Refuge and make-up vlogger Lauren Luke collaborated on Don’t Cover It to highlight domestic abuse and this year Zoe Suggs (aka Zoella), has announced that she’s an ambassador for Mind. If charities want to reach out to new and younger audiences, then working with vloggers will be essential. 3.#Mycommunity by Zoe Amar, director at Zoe Amar Communications #Nomakeupselfie and #icebucketchallenge were big campaigns with a global reach, dominated by large charities. But, there are huge opportunities for charities in hyperlocal social media. I’d like to see smaller charities run local viral campaigns. As local authority budgets are cut, communities will need to support each other and rely more on charities. I’d love to see a #mycommunity campaign that raises funds for local charities. 4. #Bellfie by Matt Collins, managing director at Platypus Digital The big craze for 2015 will be the #bellfie. The concept will really chime with the public, who will take selfies of themselves next to any kind of bell, be it doorbells, hand-held bells or even bluebells. This will signify ‘ringing the changes’ in their chosen campaign. The craze will kick off in London on New Year’s Eve with a record number of selfies taken with Big Ben (the #belfryselfie). 5. #ImSpartacus by Alex Swallow, social entrepreneur  An awareness-raising campaign, “I’m Spartacus” is where people rally around on social media to support an individual. If someone experiences an injustice, other people who feel their pain/have experienced a similar situation show their solidarity by using the hashtag #ImSpartacus and linking to the website of a relevant charity that supports that issue.

There weren’t many Hackney Parrots, tracks that could unite the overground and underground in cheek-chewing, gunfingering abandon. Miss Modular’s Reflector Pack was one, though – its “4/4” incarnation showed off the steady power of the on-beat, a totem pole around which the rest of the track capers. Percussion and one-note melodic stabs rang with soca energy over the bass drum, in a lizard-brained command to lose your shit.    LNRDCROY – I Met You On BC Ferries Two of the most heartening stories in 2014 electronics have been a) the rise of the 1080p label, putting out lo-fi, dubby, mould-spore disco and rap, and b) Vancouver defying its “No Fun City” cliche to become an outpost for Balearic groove. They dovetail with LNRDCROY, whose 1080p release Much Less Normal can, at its best, go toe-to-toe with Boards of Canada and early Aphex in terms of poignancy. I Met You On BC Ferries is the high point, a repeated four-bar organ jam hoisted into transcendence by an almost Tony Allenesque polyrhythmic backbeat. A good percentage of its 1500 Spotify plays have been from me, and here’s hoping it gets a bigger audience as it’s reissued on vinyl by Firecracker early next year. He just pips Pender Street Steppers and Jack J to the 2014 Vancouver disco crown.    Joey Anderson – It’s a Choice There’s another wisp of Tony Allen in this incredibly atmospheric highlight from Joey Anderson’s After Forever LP. At the back of the track, the beat is anxious, with a churning, totally unknowable sound behind it, as if wind is rushing past rusted harp strings; at the front, jazzy acid stabs raise the confidence, only to be undone by the vocals, a panicked, preoccupied man repeating the title over and over. What is he deciding between? Caught in eternal equivalence, he takes the mystery with him as the track fades to the shuffling beat. The year’s best dancefloor psychosis.    Traxman – Let It Roll Geto One of the saddest losses in 2014 was DJ Rashad, who gave so much body and direction to Chicago’s juke sound – but his legacy is being honoured, with the style’s innovation still as propulsive as its hi-hats. DJs Earl, Spinn and Taye continue to evangelise with DJ sets that feature as much cardio as a spinning class, while the Next Life compilation showed juke could sit with junglism, chiptune and glitch. But for me it’s Traxman who is making the most jawdropping work. His nearest analogues are probably Madlib or J Dilla, with their soul collages like torn billboards with the old ads glinting through. But where they lazily bump, Traxman bops with antic energy. On Let It Roll Geto, a fragment of Sweet Dreams, deranged with cold, shivers itself first into a waltz and then to relentless 4/4 ghetto house – this is funk at its most brittle and daring.    Austin Cesear – 1 Year This, from Brooklynite-via-California Austin Cesear, is my favourite electronic track of the year, and joins Belfast and Do It Now as one of the all-time great sunset anthems. There are simple congas, melancholy chords, and true surf guitar – not twangy 60s pop, but the sound of crashing waves put into strings. As these elements build, you expect them to cohere smoothly when the kick drum kicks, but instead chaos reigns: horns blare in, vocals garble, snares double pace. This white water, overwhelming and inexact, is the exact opposite of the “deep house” that paired with thigh gap pics on YouTube – where those tracks merely signify bliss, Cesear fully enacts the troubling and confusing reality of (perhaps chemically-assisted) joy. It’s a state we all strive for, but when you get there, you can’t bottle it; instead it has you asking more questions than you can answer. Here, then, is the beauty and terror of pure happiness.

Goth is a fabulously edgy beauty: the lashless, Elizabethan majesty of Lily Cole, the space-cadet sensuality of Lana Del Rey, the tomboy sass of Sissy Spacek in Badlands. Oh, and with the rosebud lips of Lindsey Wixson thrown in for good measure (like I said, we’re obsessed already). She made a bold entree onto the silver screen with her debut in Lars von Trier’s five-hour epic Nymphomaniac, playing Charlotte Gainsbourg’s sadomasochistic, hypersexual mini-me.

She’s got really good hair – if you’ve been watching The Legacy and admiring Gro’s swept-back platinum elegance, you are going to LOVE Silvia – and she knows how to work a black trousersuit with a simple pair of stud earrings.

FIFTY! So I think it’s fair to say: the lady’s gonna have a moment. In fact, she’s already having one. Her 1997 song, Hunter, was the soundtrack for the recent Dior catwalk show in Tokyo, while the models wore looped braids of the kind Björk made hip in the 90s. Our all-time favourite Björk look remains the cover of 1993 album Debut – mohair grunge knit, stringy bob, prayer hands – but next year’s look is as yet unveiled. Can she top the swan dress? Leandra Medine    Fashion blogger Leandra Medine. Photograph: Vivien Killilea/Getty Images   Reading Leandra Medine’s blog, Man Repeller, is like reading the fashion industry as a screenplay by Lena Dunham. The name was born from Leandra’s conversations with friends about how the best fashion is always the stuff boys totally don’t get. Medine is now a front row fixture, and a street style superstar, who nails the way we want to look right now. Example: see her blog for a video on how to do the perfect imperfect hair-tuck in a turtleneck sweater. She will matter in 2015 because she is one of the few voices in the fashion industry engaging in discussions about feminism and female conformity. One of her most popular posts was “Why I Don’t Wear Make-Up” and in a recent post, “Why I Wear Bad Pants” she writes that she likes high-waisted, crop-length trousers because: “I know they don’t look good but I think they’re cool. They make me feel like a more interesting version of myself and that, to me, is what style is about.” Rihanna    Rihanna. Photograph: Marc Piasecki/GC Images   2014 was – by RiRi’s standards – a quiet year. Taking a six-month sabbatical from her hugely influential Instagram account between May and September, after a row over topless pictures, effectively ceded huge swathes of pop cultural territory to Kim Kardashian, whose wedding photo – three weeks after RiRi’s self-imposed Insta-exile – became the most-liked picture on Instagram, ever. (Right now, Kim has 24 million followers to RiRi’s 14 million.)

41,2015-01-01T10:09:29Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/01/tony-pulis-appointed-west-brom,Tony Pulis appointed West Brom head coach on two-and-a-half-year deal,football,Football,The Guardian,"Tony Pulis has been appointed as the new head coach of West Brom on a two-and-a-half-year deal, the Premier League club have announced. Pulis will begin his new role after Thursday’s Premier League match at West Ham, with his first game in charge the FA Cup third-round game against Gateshead. “Every successful club is built on unity and that is what I shall strive to help bring to Albion,” Pulis told the club’s official website. “We need everyone together from top to bottom – the supporters, all the staff, the players, everyone who has an interest in the club’s welfare. With that, we can go forward together and hopefully take this club up the Premier League.” In what was a two-horse race between Pulis and Tim Sherwood from the moment Alan Irvine was sacked on Monday, the Albion board decided Pulis, who was named the Premier League’s manager of the year after turning round Crystal Palace’s fortunes last season, was the outstanding candidate. Albion felt his experience, including a record of never being relegated in 22 years of management, could not be ignored and are confident the 56-year-old will secure their Premier League status for a sixth successive season.   Related: Survival instincts made Tony Pulis obvious choice for West Brom job | Stuart James   Any concerns Pulis had about working within Albion’s continental structure have been allayed, with the former Stoke manager assured he will have full control of the first team and the final say on transfers in and out of the club. Albion maintain that has always been the case in the past. “We are delighted to secure a man of Tony’s calibre and proven ability,” said the club’s technical director, Terry Burton. “He made it clear that this position excited him and that he was eager to get back into the business of winning Premier League points - and there are few who know how to do it better.”",profile/guardian-sport,sport,guardian

He was once a confident and able man. A man who might have been a little anal retentive, but also someone who could do things. A former railroad engineer, a builder and a planner and someone who left a solid, well executed mark on the world. But as Jonathan Franzen’s The Corrections begins, we quickly see that Alfred, although “still an imposing” figure, is in trouble. He is succumbing rapidly to Parkinson’s disease and dementia. Soon, he’s reduced to having conversations with hallucinatory faeces. Lots of faeces. Faeces that are conspiring against him. For a good part of the rest of the book he sits in his basement, where he has gathered all the things that he has saved and fixed over the years. Things that he thought he would be able to keep on saving, and fixing, but which are all beyond him now. In a moment of lucidity, he sees that he has lost his grip on this accumulation of a lifetime and ought to just “pitch the whole damn lot of it”. Which is horribly poignant. But it’s not so much of a punch in the guts as his other big moment of clarity. This is when he tells his daughter Denise: “Just have fun and be careful.” The situation is awful. He is naked on a bed. He has been talking nonsense: strange confused memories and jabber. He has just wet himself - and also wet Denise, because he lost control of his bladder just as she was gripping his leg. She is about to clean the mess but he says: “Leave that to your mother … I never intended to involve you in any of this. You have your own life. Just have fun and be careful.” He says it again to show it was no fluke: “I want you to go and have fun. And be careful.” And oh sweet lord. It is moments like this one that cut through the hype and hot air, the nonsense and impossible expectations surrounding Jonathan Franzen. This is why his novels will be read for decades to come and will matter for decades to come. He understands something fundamental. He knows how a father feels for his daughter, and he is able to boil it down to one beautiful, heartbreaking end-of-the-tether cry: “Just have fun and be careful.” It is almost every parent’s dearest wish and deepest longing for their child: Please don’t get hurt. Please be happy. When it arrives in the book, it is an extraordinary moment. And all the more so because it is a quiet one - a space of steady calm amidst all the fizz and babble of the rest of this gigantic book. In one quick instant, the wee-stained, shaking, naked, pathetic old man is made noble. He has done terrible things in his life. He has been a generally inadequate father and an abusive, appalling husband. Even in this finest moment he still thinks his wife should be made to clean up urine. And yet he also takes this chance to express a deepest sentiment of humanity, the ultimate expression of familial love. He latches onto the thing I’d hope I could also cling to, and pass on to my own daughter, if I had lost everything else. I find it hard to think of any one individual scene from a modern book that I have found as moving. It helps that his shot the heart comes amid all the other sound and fury of The Corrections - the moments of non-communication, hundreds of the messages that don’t get through or are wilfully ignored. All of which also certainly adds to the truth of his portrayal of the dysfunctional family - adds to the notion that this is one of the truest books about family we have. It’s notable that when Time magazine produced their list of the All Time 100 Novels, “family” was the thing they immediately went for, in the first line of their review of The Corrections : “If family is a machine for making you crazy, has there ever been a machine better oiled than the Lamberts?” Superficially, this is bang on. The novel reads like a catalogue of the faults and problems of the Lamberts and all the ways they wind each other up. Alfred the brute turned turd-man. Enid who doesn’t want to know about anything that challenges her view of the world. Their variously messed-up children, lost in their own mistakes, trying not to come home for Christmas, arguing incessantly. Yet I’m wary of suggesting that the family in The Corrections is simply about madness and disaster. On a deeper level, Franzen also brings out the most endearing qualities of the Lamberts. Yes, we get to see them at their lowest ebb and know them at their very worst - and yet somehow this helps us appreciate them more deeply. Franzen has made the Lamberts real and allowed them sympathy, while moments like that exchange between Alfred and Denise are electrifying. We come to know that in spite of everything, there is also good in these people. We see how they are redeemed by each other. We are shown, in short, into the heart of a family.",profile/samjordison,jordison,

According to a police spokesman, the incident happened after Taliban fighters attacked an Afghan army headquarters in Sangin, an embattled district in Helmand province where US and British troops were involved in years of fierce fighting. When the army retaliated, the insurgents hid out close to the wedding party, which a rocket then accidentally struck, the spokesman, Fareed Ahmad Obaid, said. However, according to the local governor who visited the scene, eyewitnesses disagreed on events. Some villagers confirmed the police’s claims that it was the Taliban who initiated the clash by attacking an army outpost. Yet relatives of the dead denied that the Taliban had engaged in fighting, as did Qari Yusaf Ahmadi, a local Taliban spokesman. The incident happened while guests were awaiting the arrival of the bride at the home of her cousin, Abdul Haleem, in the village of Bayam Zoi in Sarwankhala district. The rocket hit a building where women and children were gathered. At least 45 wounded were transported by ambulance to Lashkar Gah, the provincial capital where the Italian organisation Emergency runs a surgical centre. Geicomo Menaldo, a senior hospital staff member, said every one of the victims they received were women and children. The death toll remained unclear last night, but at least 20 are known to have died. Abdullah Jan, 12, told the Associated Press he still does not know where his mother is after being knocked unconscious while running to welcome the bride, and waking up hours later in the hospital. “We were ready to go to sleep when my auntie came and said the bride had arrived. My mother went out to see the bride and I was running after her, toward the door when I heard the sound of a blast and some bright flash like a fire hit me,” Abdullah said. Both his legs were broken and he suffered burns to his belly. “Then I couldn’t see anything. I heard people shouting and after that I didn’t know what happened. The next time I opened my eyes I was here,” he added. The Afghan government has announced that it is launching an investigation into the incident. The head of the army in southern Helmand province, General Sultan Mahmoud, told the Associated Press that an early investigation indicated that the army had used artillery that travelled three kilometres, much longer than would have been necessary, had it wanted to target the Taliban’s outposts. “We are seeing no evidence that the Taliban can fire from that distance, and as the Taliban positions were only one kilometre from the checkpoint,” Mahmoud told AP. He added that the house seemed to have been attacked from two opposite directions, prompting questions about whether the house had been targeted deliberately. On Sunday, at a ceremony in Kabul marking the end of Nato’s mission, General Hans-Lothar Domröse, a senior Nato official, commended the Afghan security forces for demonstrating “time and again their ability, willingness and confidence to defeat the enemy and provide a secure environment for the Afghan people”. However, the tragedy on Wednesday is a poignant reminder that, although western leaders have hailed the military transition as the end of the war in Afghanistan, for Afghans, the conflict is far from over. The Afghan security forces assume control at a time when war rages in many parts of the country. More than 3,000 civilians were killed in 2014, with the total number of casualties surpassing 10,000, according to a recent UN tally. That is a 19% jump from 2013, and makes 2014 the war’s bloodiest year on record for Afghan civilians. This year also saw an increase of 33% casualties among children, and 12% among women. Whether the Afghan army and police will be able to secure peace in the country depends not only on their ability to suppress the insurgency, which has reignited particularly forcefully in Helmand. They also need to gain the trust of the Afghan people. While insurgents are responsible for the vast majority of civilian deaths, stories of abuse and corruption have marred the reputation of government forces. Sangin district has remained a hotly contested area since the early days of the war. During the past year, insurgents have challenged the government’s security to the point where some fear the district might fall completely to the Taliban.    The area where the wedding attack occurred is one of many Taliban strongholds in the district. At the moment, the army’s front line against the insurgents is barely 300 metres from its headquarters, according to Helmand’s provincial governor, Mohammad Naim Baloch. The provincial security forces are unable to clear the area, he said. He has asked the central government in Kabul and the country’s intelligence services for air support and engineers to detect improvised explosive devices. “So far we have received nothing,” he said. During the past year, Afghan forces have asked Nato for air support approximately 400 times, according to Brian Tribus, the director of public affairs for Nato in Kabul. Only 7% of the requests were met. Under its new mission, Resolute Support, the remaining 18,000 US and Nato forces will primarily train, advise and assist the 350,000-strong national forces. Roughly 5,000 of the American soldiers will retain a limited fighting role to conduct force protection and counterterrorism. But they will only be able to directly assist Afghan forces in what is termed “extreme circumstances”. With the unstable security situation, uncertainty keeps growing as newly elected president Ashraf Ghani and his chief executive, Abdullah Abdullah, struggle to form a cabinet. As a November deadline for ministerial appointments came and went, the prolonged election crisis seems set to bleed into the government’s first term. The political tussle is thought to be particularly over the bodies concerned with security: the ministry of defence, ministry of interior, as well as top posts in the intelligence agency National Directorate of Security.",profile/sune-engel-rasmussen,Sune,Engel Rasmussen

Entitled Only One, it’s a far cry from his previous album’s gnarly, angry sensibility. Over jazzy organ chords, he channels his late mother, hearing her speak from beyond the grave. Ahead of a tender organ solo from McCartney, she movingly tells him to “tell Nori about me”, referring to West’s daughter North - though this being Kanye, she also tells him how great he is: “The good outweighs the bad even on your worst day.” There may be more work to come from West and McCartney - earlier this year, the New York Post reported that they were working on a song called Piss On My Grave. As well as touring Yeezus around the world, West had a busy 2014, fitting in a campaign for Balmain and trainer designs for Nike and Adidas around the recording of his new LP, which he has postponed after previously saying it would arrive in the autumn. In May he married Kim Kardashian, famously spending days tinkering with their official wedding photo on Instagram. McCartney, meanwhile, recently released Hope For the Future, a new song written for the soundtrack to the videogame Destiny.

After more than a year in jail, Canadian-Egyptian Mohamed Fahmy, Australian Peter Greste and Egyptian Baher Mohamed now face several further months behind bars, with no date for a new hearing set. Fahmy and Greste could still be deported under the terms of a recent presidential decree that allows foreign nationals to serve sentences in their home countries, but President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi’s office did not respond to a request for comment about his intentions. The hearing spanned two sessions that lasted for a total of less than 30 minutes, with both the defendants and reporters barred from entry. Defence lawyers were given just minutes to explain their clients’ innocence, with one calling the prosecution’s evidence “laughable”.  After the verdict, the families and lawyers of the detainees reacted with disappointment, having earlier expressed hope of a conditional release.  Greste’s mother, Lois, was initially lost for words, saying simply: “I can’t believe it.” His father, Juris, said: “I’m shocked, I’m shocked.” Later, Lois said: “We need some time to process this. It is not as positive as we had hoped for.” In the corridor nearby, Fahmy’s brother Adel said Mohamed “will be very disappointed. We knew a full release was impossible, but we had high hopes of a release on bail.”  #AJ3: Last year's trial was in a prison. Today's is in the centre of town, at the much sleeker Court of Appeal pic.twitter.com/oCe7AF19Q6— Patrick Kingsley (@PatrickKingsley) January 1, 2015  Greste had been in Egypt for a fortnight when he was arrested in late December 2013 along with his two colleagues, as well as several students accused of aiding them in a terrorist plot. They were convicted in June 2014 of aiding terrorists, belonging to the banned Muslim Brotherhood, spreading false information, and undermining Egyptian national security. Outside Egypt, observers saw the case as a politicised attack on freedom of expression that ignored due process, and formed just one part of a rampant crackdown on all forms of opposition in Egypt. But within the country, where the coverage of AJE’s Arabic sister channels has strongly favoured the Brotherhood, many government supporters saw the journalists as a legitimate target. With no foreign passport, Baher Mohamed’s only remaining hopes of freedom are in the retrial, with foreign observers expressing hopes that it would be fairer than the first trial. “We had very serious concerns about the first trial,” said the Australian ambassador to Cairo, Ralph King, after emerging from the Cairo courtroom. “So it is very encouraging that a retrial has been ordered but still we maintain that journalists never be on trial.” But Fahmy’s family said they had lost faith in the legal process after an initial trial that used, among other incongruous items, a song by the Australian singer-songwriter Gotye as evidence. “This is really bad, we were hoping they would be released,” said Fahmy’s fiancee, Marwa Omara. “The only way out now is the deportation law. We hope that the prosecution will approve our request to transfer Mohamed to Canada.” While the Grestes have portrayed the trio’s plight as one solely connected to freedom of speech, the Fahmys see them as pawns in a cold war between Egypt and Qatar, the owners of al-Jazeera and key supporters of the Brotherhood. Relations are gradually improving between the two countries, culminating in Qatar’s closure of the Egypt-based wing of al-Jazeera last month, raising hopes that the trio might be released in a reciprocal gesture. “I hope things keep on getting better between Egypt and Qatar as it’s totally unfair that these poor journalists should be subject to their disagreement,” said Adel Fahmy, as he left the courthouse.  #AJ3: @MFFahmy11's brother Adel giving statements outside court pic.twitter.com/0JN5q4dHTc— Patrick Kingsley (@PatrickKingsley) January 1, 2015  Egyptian officials publicly maintain that their judiciary is strictly independent of any executive authority, and say the case is not politicised. The trio are among at least 16 journalists and up to 40,000 political prisoners currently detained in Egypt. In a statement, an al-Jazeera spokesman said: “The Egyptian authorities have a simple choice – free these men quickly, or continue to string this out, all the while continuing this injustice and harming the image of their own country in the eyes of the world. They should choose the former.” Additional reporting: Manu Abdo",profile/patrick-kingsley,kingsley,patrick

In the feature race at Southwell today Dungannon, a horse with no experience of the surface, looks a favourite worth taking on. Poyle Vinnie (2.40), who has form on Fibresand, has posted two good performances on his most recent outings over course and distance and looks set to take advantage if Dungannon doesn’t run up to his best on his first taste of the Southwell sand. At Musselburgh in the televised handicap chase, Viva Colonia (1.35) looks to have been trained with this race in mind and should give a good account of himself. He was runner-up last year and is on a 4lb lower mark and while there’s not much to shout about with regard to his recent form he is a dual course-and-distance winner and a return to this track could well bring about the required improvement. You can read my round up of the action at Cheltenham here and while Ptit Zig is the likeliest winner of the novice chase he is a short price and I think Little Jon (1.20), who was going well until running out four from home in the race won by Champagne West and who will be well suited if this becomes a test of stamina, will run a big race. He is the each-way call at the prices available this morning.

The UK passed “emergency” legislation, referred to as the Drip Act, expanding mass surveillance powers in the wake of European court judgments. In the US, modest reforms to domestic mass surveillance failed to pass Congress. Ireland retrospectively made legal UK mass surveillance efforts related to the country, while even Germany – one of the most outspoken nations on surveillance – has challenged Der Spiegel’s reporting of the tapping of Angela Merkel’s phone. On surveillance, 2014 was the year the administration struck back. But while the Conservative party in the UK has made it clear it would like to further extend surveillance powers, both sides of the Atlantic might find next year a closer fight than they would think. Two key pieces of legislation authorising surveillance are coming up for renewal. Most important is the Patriot Act, which must be renewed by 1 June, or else go out of force – taking with it the NSA’s collection of US phone details. In the UK, the major parties have pledged to re-examine the critical Ripa legislation, which authorises most UK mass-surveillance programmes, after the election – and have to renew the Drip legislation by the end of 2016. The other key place to watch will be the courts: there are multiple challenges in UK tribunals, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the European court of justice, and several cases attempting to get the US supreme court to make its first surveillance rulings since Edward Snowden’s leaks.    Participants at the 31st Chaos Communication Congress demonstrate with posters of Edward Snowden in Hamburg.  Photograph: Malte Christians/EPA   The technological backdrop is similarly mixed: in the immediate wake of Snowden, a flurry of new companies promising privacy arose, but there’s not yet a definitive app, while incumbents such as Tor have revealed several attacks and security breaches (since fixed). Conversely, though, major players are starting to regard privacy as a selling point: Google and others are encrypting ever more of their traffic, and even enhancing privacy controls over which information the search and social giants store. So it’s all to play for in the year ahead. Against a backdrop of high-profile hacks and terror attacks in western cities, it’s conceivable that surveillance powers will be strengthened. But the post-Snowden reform movement still has momentum, and there’s every chance that documents from Snowden or some other whistleblower could influence the debate in 2015.",profile/jamesball,James,Ball
48,2015-01-01T11:20:38Z,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jan/01/the-breakdown-dylan-hartley-england,England must decide whether Dylan Hartley is an asset or liability,sport,Sport,The Guardian,"DECISION TIME FOR LANCASTER England, it has been reported, will not hold Dylan Hartley’s red card last month, for elbowing the Leicester centre Matt Smith, against the hooker when the management amends its senior squad this month. The coaches, so it goes, regard the incident as petulant rather than violent, never mind that a broken nose could have been the outcome, and will not be carrying out last year’s threat of the head coach Stuart Lancaster. Then he warned Hartley, who had been sent off in the Premiership final that May against Leicester, earning his third ban in two seasons, that his discipline had to improve otherwise England would have no use for him. “We thought long and hard about leaving out Dylan,” said Lancaster in August 2013. “I had a long chat with him after I returned from Argentina, wanting to be reassured he understood where the line was and what was right and wrong in terms of discipline. What we have always talked about since I have been in charge is that if you don’t have a rigorous approach to being disciplined then you hurt yourself because you concede points and go down to 14 men that makes it very hard to win international games.” A few weeks later, at the Aviva Premiership launch, Hartley said he knew where he stood: “I sat down with Stuart and we had a chat. It wasn’t about him telling me, but I understand that he can’t keep giving me a chance. I’m basically on my last chance in the England set-up. That’s fully understood.” It was not the first time Lancaster had had cause to speak to Hartley about discipline. Before England left for the 2012 tour to South Africa he said: “We will be sitting down with Dylan and explaining to him exactly what is required to be an international player. We have to be able to trust the players. If we can’t trust a player on the field then he won’t be selected. We will have a pretty strong conversation and he has to prove to us he is ready to come back into the Test arena. We will make sure he gets the message.” Last year’s warning was delivered after a petulant, rather than a violent, act: Hartley was dismissed in the final for swearing at the referee Wayne Barnes and calling him a cheat, although in his defence the forward maintained his words had been addressed to the Tigers’ hooker, Ben Youngs. The disciplinary hearing did not believe his account and he was given an 11-week suspension. He received three weeks for elbowing Smith, two for the offence, which was put at the low end of the scale by Jeremy Summers, the judicial officer who heard the case, and one for his poor disciplinary record. Had he not pleaded guilty, the ban would have been higher, as it would had Smith been injured. An unnamed source in one newspaper said that the incident had in no way put Hartley’s international career in jeopardy, despite the warnings he received from Lancaster about the need for discipline in 2012 and 2013. The notion that the elbow on Smith was an act of petulance is risible: had he shoved the centre, it perhaps could have been described as such. Smith had been seeking a reaction by holding on to Hartley after clearing the hooker out of a ruck, and the one he got was far more violent than petulant. Anyway – and if the England management had anything to say about Hartley’s Test future it should surely have been public – it was a non-violent act that earned the Northampton captain his “last chance” warning in 2013. If the report is true, it amounts to an act of contortion because England need a player who was not only their most capped in the autumn but remains their leading set-piece hooker whose throwing in to the lineout is superior to that of Tom Youngs and Rob Webber. Lancaster will not have been amused, and not just because when he next faces the media he will be asked how many final warnings Hartley will receive. England’s opening match in the Six Nations is against Wales in Cardiff, and while the hooker was the subject of a wind-up by Warren Gatland ahead of the 2011 match between the sides at the Millennium Stadium, the target was how Hartley handled pressure rather than provocation. Wales will goad Hartley from the start, and so will every other one of England’s opponents right through the year, which ends with the World Cup that the Rugby Football Union is hosting. Northampton got away with going down to 14 men so early against Leicester, but it is not a handicap Lancaster will want to experience. Hartley said after his dismissal in the Premiership final that he had no intention of consulting a sports psychologist, but if his international career is to end naturally – and by signing a new contract with Northampton he declared his intent of playing for England beyond the World Cup – he will need to find another way of releasing frustration. His director of rugby at Northampton, Jim Mallinder, said his captain was someone who lived on the edge, and Hartley is far from alone there, but four suspensions in three calendar years and an accumulation of bans in his career that is only a few weeks short of a year suggest he too often falls off it. The question for Lancaster is whether Hartley is an asset or a liability. The head coach was unimpressed in November when Hartley was sent to the sin-bin for trampling on Duane Vermeulen as the No8 slowed down the home side’s ball at a ruck and with him went England’s comeback. Hartley was left out of the next match against Samoa, which he may have been anyway, only to return against Australia the following week. It may come down to what takes longer to crack: making Hartley’s temperament on the field as equable as it is off it or getting Youngs’s line-out throwing to the standard of his rival’s. • This is an extract taken from the Breakdown, the Guardian’s weekly rugby union email.

49,2015-01-01T11:30:09Z,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/01/sleep-new-years-resolution-success,Sleep your way to new year’s resolution success,commentisfree,Opinion,The Guardian,"A few years ago I tracked over 3,000 people attempting to achieve a range of new year’s resolutions, including losing weight, exercising more, stopping smoking and drinking less. At the start of the study, 52% of participants were confident of success. One year later, only 12% had actually achieved their goal. So what can you do to increase your chances of making your 2015 resolutions a reality? It might be as a simple as getting a better night’s sleep. Last month I asked more than 1,000 people to rate both the quality of their sleep and how successful they were at achieving their resolutions. The results revealed a strong relationship, with 60% of people who slept well saying they were able to achieve their resolutions, compared to just 44% of those who slept poorly. These findings build on previous work showing that sleep deprivation disrupts self-control and willpower. So, if you want to increase your chances of achieving your aims and ambitions this year, here are five scientifically proven ways to improve the quality of your sleep: 1. Avoid the blues Research has shown that light towards the blue end of the spectrum is especially effective at keeping you awake because it disrupts the production of the sleep hormone melatonin. Unfortunately, computer screens, tablets and smartphones all emit large amounts of blue light. If you must use these devices late in the evening, try turning down the brightness. Better still, avoid them for an hour or so before you head to bed. 2. Busy your brain If you find yourself lying in bed unable to sleep, tire your mind. For example, think of a category, such as countries or fruit and vegetables, and then come up with an example of that category for each letter of the alphabet, for example, A is for Albania, B is for Bulgaria, or A is for Apple, B is for Broccoli. 3. Get up If you wake for more than about 20 minutes during the night you might start to associate your bed with wakefulness. Instead, get out of bed and spend about 15 minutes or so reading a book or doing a jigsaw.    Solving the sleep puzzle.  Photograph: Dimitri Vervitsiotis/Getty Images   4. Fake it When you behave as if you are sleepy you become tired. To take advantage of this strange effect, let your eyes droop, your mouth hang open, and your arms and legs feel heavy. Sink into your bed as if you have had a long and tiring day in the office. Even fake a yawn or two. In short, fool your body into thinking that it is time to go to sleep. 5. Remember the 90-minute rule Throughout the night you pass through several “light sleep – deep sleep – light sleep” cycles. Each cycle takes 90 minutes and you will feel most refreshed when you awake at the end of a cycle. To maximise the chances of this, figure out when you want to wake up, then count back in 90-minute blocks to find a time near to when you want to go to sleep. So, if you want to wake up at 7am and go to bed at around 11pm, chunking back in 90-minute segments would look like this: 7am, 5.30am, 4am, 2.30am, 1am, 11.30pm, 10pm. And so you should try to fall asleep at around 10 pm or 11.30pm. Sleep well, and hopefully you will find it much easier to make your dreams a reality in 2015.    Try and avoid tablets at bedtime.

Nor had I ever visited North Wall before, and the place proved instantly likable, with a galleried upper tier of seating that made the theatre space reminiscent of some sort of 17th-century coaching inn where they happened to be throwing on a play. This defiantly non-standard adaptation is the latest effort from kids’-theatre specialists Creation, and at 2 hours 10 minutes (including a 20-minute interval), this is not for those with a short attention span; though my four-year-old sat through the whole thing with her eyes glued front – perhaps helped on her way by the half-time strawberry ice cream. Parents should probably be aware, though, that this is a slightly more grownup-type theatre experience than, say, Angelina or Peppa Pig. As for the play itself: well, we all know the story, right? Messing about in boats, Toad, poop-poop, the Wild Wood, secret tunnel, weasels and almighty dustup to finish with. Creation embellish this venerable narrative framework with a blizzard of novelties – from the opening scene in which a group of hikers stumble over a book in what seems like an abandoned building, to self-referential meta moments when the actors step out of character to squabble among themselves. (Well, I’m assuming that it’s in the script, unless they decided mid-show to stop Rhys King from doing his Gypsy woman speech.) Written and directed by Gari Jones, the show generates non-stop energy from its six-strong cast – of which special mention must be made of assistant director Dave Burn, who stepped in to play Mole at the last minute, after Claire Andreadis dropped out due to illness. The main heavy lifting was done by Georgina Strawson as a jittery Ratty and Will Norris as Toad, channelling Alan B’Stard-era Rik Mayall. Clare Humphrey and the above-mentioned Rhys King adroitly took care of multiple characters, while Thomas Richardson lumbered heroically about in a fat suit as Badger. As for the embellishments: well, some were better than others. I liked the stress on the eco message of the piece, a plea for the countryside to remain undisturbed, as well as the funny songs and the contribution of a quartet of kids from the drama groups that the company run. On the other, I wasn’t entirely sure that Toad needed to be a rock star, or that it was necessary for one of the weasels to talk in urban patois. But nothing really got in the way of the show’s tremendous verve and high good humour. • Until 10 January. Box office: 01865 766266.

Figures published by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) show that the average time people spent waiting in a phone queue to HMRC was 10 minutes and 53 seconds – more than double the wait from a year ago. The figures also showed 34.5% of calls were cut off, significantly up from the 20.5% recorded last year, and less than one in 10 calls about tax credits were answered in under two minutes – down from one in three a year ago. The average waiting time for tax inquiries rose from four minutes 42 seconds in 2013 to almost 12 minutes in September 2014. For tax credits the wait doubled from seven minutes 13 seconds in 2013 to 14 minutes 28 seconds in 2014. The figures were released by HMRC last month, and first highlighted in the Daily Mail. Shabana Mahmood MP, Labour’s shadow exchequer secretary, said that the figures were “unacceptable”. “At a time when people are paying more in tax and have seen their tax credits cut, it simply isn’t good enough. “Long waits and poor service are particularly frustrating when many people are facing difficult times for the personal finances. Overall, the proportion of calls to HMRC actually handled fell from 79.5% a year ago to 65.5%. “Ministers need to get a grip on this chaos and ensure HMRC is providing a decent service for taxpayers. The government shouldn’t be leaving people hanging on the telephone,” said Mahmood. HMRC said: “We are working hard to improve our handling of customer calls and are moving up to 1,500 extra people on to the phones during January, as the self-assessment deadline approaches. “HMRC receives around 70m calls a year and we know that some of our customers can struggle to get through on our helplines at very busy times. “This year we are introducing new technology to help us answer more calls quicker at busy times, and we are improving the digital services we offer so that more customers can find all they need online.

Independent security researcher Brian Krebs claimed the arrested man was Vinnie Omari, posting what appeared to be a copy of Omari’s bail notice after having alleged that the 22-year-old was part of the Lizard Squad hacking group. “Sources tell KrebsOnSecurity that Vinnie is one of many individuals associated with this sad little club who are being rounded up and questioned,” said Krebs in a blog post. “They took everything, Xbox One, phones, laptops, computer USBs, etc,” Omari allegedly told the Daily Dot in an email revealing the search warrant issued by Reading magistrates court but failing to elaborate on the charges and alleged crimes in 2013. The Lizard Squad, described as “a band of young hooligans” by Krebs, has been linked with a series of high-profile distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. These attacks prevent legitimate users of services such as Sony’s PlayStation Network from connecting to them by bombarding them with bogus connections, overloading the service and effectively taking it offline often until the attack ceases. The group recently launched a DDoS tool that could allow anyone to conduct similar attacks on targets of their choosing, costing between $6 (£3.85) and $500 per attack paid via the bitcoin cryptocurrency. • PlayStation Network back online, while Lizard hacker group basks in limelight",profile/samuel-gibbs,Samuel,Gibbs

Daughter of Smoke and Bone is by Laini Taylor, and is, without a doubt, one of my most favourite trilogies ever! It's suitable for girls and boys aged 14 and up, and it flawlessly combines high fantasy with romance, edge-of-your-seat-thrill and a general (for a lack of a better word) Laini-Taylorness. Set predominantly in the magical streets of Prague, blue haired Karou is a seemingly ordinary art student. Yet, at a moments notice, Karou could be away for days at a time, disappearing through the doors that lead to the inexplicable 'Elsewhere'; only returning when she completed her errand, with her pockets full of teeth and wishes. Now, black handprints are burning the doors to her family, the doors to her second life. The doors to 'Elsewhere' are closing, and they're leaving Karou behind. Karou is thrust into a heart-wrenching journey of love, loss and magic. Note: It's not as soppy as I have made it out to be! All will be clear once you read the book!! Daughter of Smoke and Bone is beautifully written and Taylor's story telling is breath-taking and intricate. I was immersed into the beautiful world Taylor has built, and the character and world building is rich and detailed. The book itself is funny and witty, the ponderings of Karou leaving me in giggles, and I found myself often rereading paragraphs because they were just that good!! Zuzana and Mik, Karou's human friends (that are literally the coolest, cutest couple ever. I totally 'ship' it), helped to ground the book, and make it easier to understand and lighten it. This series is something I am definitely going to reread in the near future, and Laini Taylor has won the crown of one of many favourite authors. I can't praise this book (and series) highly enough without toeing (more like calf-ing) the fine line of rambling, but read this and you'll definitely thank me. • Buy this book at the Guardian Bookshop.

While that might not be a good thing, bringing your own packed lunch certainly is. Unlike everything else in life, you get out of it what you put in. And if you’ve got something good to look forward to at lunch, it’ll brighten up your day. In 2015, not buying takeaway packed lunches will save you money in the long run, as well as keeping you healthier (if you’re making it, then you control what goes into your lunch), and saner (no one likes a shop sandwich let-down, or spending half your break queuing for an overpriced cheese roll). Crucially, it also enables you to make your favourite things, rather than relying on what’s left in the meal-deal section at 1.30pm. With all this in mind, here are some tips on getting started for the novice packed-luncher. • If you didn’t get a fancy or novelty packed lunch tin for Christmas, then take a trip to the local pound shop (where nothing, mysteriously, is ever £1) or Robert Dyas (when did this shop become so enjoyable to browse in?) and purchase three Tupperware containers for your packed lunches: small, medium and large. • Map out the office territory – is there a microwave? A fridge? Cutlery? Without a microwave a Thermos flask is your friend. If there is no fridge, don’t despair. Just eat lunch on time, and use cool spots such as window ledges to avoid your sandwich dying a slow, sweaty death sitting in a tote bag by a radiator. • Keep a tub of salt and one of those picnic pepper grinders at your desk. Expand your condiment selection according to what you most enjoy: keep a squeezy tube of Colman’s in your bag or invest in a refillable sriracha keyring (we can’t believe this exists either). John Lewis sells colourful little pots that are great for decanting and transporting small quantities of salad dressing - or use a mini jam jar (we stash these away whenever we have a B&B breakfast). • Be creative with your packing: if you’re a sandwich fiend and find yourself going through metres of pricey aluminium foil, try greaseproof paper double-wrapped around your baguette and sealed with a rubber band or two. Or invest in a sandwich tin. Caroline Craig and Sophie Missing are authors of The Little Book of Lunch (Square Peg) • This article was amended on 2 January 2015. We recommended Muji’s “brilliant array of little pots intended for toiletries that are great for decanting and transporting small quantities of salad dressings”. However, product information on the Muji website says they are “Not suitable for alcohol, petrol or solvent based products of any kind, including perfumes & vinegar”.

This year, Thomas Piketty’s Capital in the 21st Century taught me more than a thousand digital quick takes, while the first volumes of Karl Ove Knausgård’s My Struggle offered more psychological insight than the whole of Twitter. Instead of frying my brain with monkey-at-typewriter thinkpieces affixed with click-chasing headlines (the wonderful Guardian, of course, never stoops so low), in 2015 I’m committed to slowing down my information intake – and accepting that the codex, with no disruptive hyperlinks and no panoptic Chartbeat trackers, is actually a superior form of information technology. Jason Farago (@jsf) I’m absolutely committed to reading all of Elena Ferrante’s Neapolitan novels this winter ... an Italian escape into the power and constructs of female friendship seems like just the thing to help sustain me until the warmer temperatures return. Jennifer Gerson Uffalussy (@jennyalyse) To try to experience art and theater in smaller venues where assignments don’t necessarily take me. There are revolutionary things happening in smaller opera venues like the Industry in Los Angeles that have strong implications for the future of the art form. Jordan Riefe (@jriefe) My new year’s resolution is to watch more movies when they are in theaters. I tend to see films on Netflix, HBO, or airplanes months after everyone has already seen them, which leaves me open to spoilers. Plus, when I admitted to Jim Jarmusch that I had seen his film Only Lovers Left Alive on a plane, he gave me the dirtiest look ever. Next year: watching movies in the theater, FTW.  Melissa Locker (@woolyknickers)    The Americans: Alison Wright as Martha Hanson as and Matthew Rhys as Philip Jennings. Photograph: Craig Blankenhorn   I promise that in 2015, I am finally going to watch The Americans. I was sceptical of the first season, but now that all the critics are loving this show, I just feel woefully behind. I see a giant binge in my future where I mainline the first two seasons of this FX show about Russian spies in 80s America before the third season starts on January 28th. Brian Moylan (@BrianJMoylan) My cultural new year’s resolution is to see more live theatre, and I’m going to start by following Sheila Heti’s All Our Happy Days Are Stupid to New York to watch its off-Broadway debut in February. Canadian theatre is something I love, but at the moment I support it more in theory than in practice. This year I’d like to skip buying a few boring drinks out and save some of my meagre income for a good theatre ticket every now and then.  Monica Heisey (@monicaheisey) Life is beginning to seem too short for any number of long novels, but Robert Musil’s The Man Without Qualities is my project for 2015. Also quitting social media. Wait, I already did that a few weeks ago. I guess rejoining social media, so I can quit again by midsummer. Matthew Specktor (@matthewspecktor) I ramped up my freelance career and in the process, I lost time to simply relax with a good book. I used to read one to two books a week, but these days I’m lucky if I can squeeze that many in a month. But I’m not interested in stuffing myself with the latest releases. This is the year to finish reading the rest of Toni Morrison and Colette’s catalogue.  Britt Julious (@britticisms) To find censored versions of all my favorite rap songs, so my three-year-old can enjoy them as much as I do. Plus, the censored versions can be more fun, like “I’m not a player I just crush a lot” or “Shame on a Nuh.” My wife should be happy. Just don’t quote me, boy, I ain’t said nothin’ yet. Ben Westhoff (@ben_westhoff) To see every Oscar-nominated movie so I can school (and then lord my victories over) anyone who’s ever beat me in the Oscar pool. Watch yourselves. Anne T Donahue (@annetdonahue) I’m going to watch more foreign films. I don’t like reading subtitles, which has led me to avoid them. As a result, I’m rather horribly ignorant of great works of art spoken in languages other than English and French. It’s time to fix that. Michelle Dean (@michelledean) Social media is like a swarm of termites chomping through the wood that is my time. I must get this under control before I lose my mind. I need to learn how to dip my toe into Twitter and Facebook maybe once or twice a day, engage with whatever is happening, and then get out. It isn’t just that hashtags anger up the blood and cloud the mind; there are real consequences. One direct result of wasting hours arguing with strangers (and, to be fair, punning with friends) is that I’ve read fewer books in 2014 than in any of my post-Dr Seuss years. This needs to change. It will change. There’s no reason why I can’t maintain a busy job as a film critic and also maintain my literacy. There are too many Penguin Classics I bought as an undergrad with their spines unbent on my shelf. That ends in 2015. Jordan Hoffman (@jhoffman)",profile/jasonfarago,Jason,Farago

In fact, there’s a case to be made that bachata megastar Romeo Santos shattered multiple sales records in part because he has never bothered pandering to what the music industry carefully calls “mainstream” audiences.  Santos, a New Yorker of Puerto Rican and Dominican descent, achieved the nearly unprecedented feat of selling out consecutive shows at Yankee Stadium this year. Even more impressively, he has managed to bridge the rarely-ventured-across divide between mostly Caribbean east coast Latinos and the more Central American and Mexican populations on the west, playing sold-out stadium shows in Los Angeles and Houston. The New York Times called him “a beacon of reverse crossover”, noting that Santos’s new album, Fórmula Vol 2, features hip hop/R&B stars like Drake and Nicki Minaj trying their hands at Spanish. On the suggestion of his own record company that he could do better if he sang in English, Santos says, “No! I have nothing against crossing over, but I don’t need to change to cross over. I’m not just selling out Yankee Stadium; I’m selling out stadiums in Mexico, in Argentina — with my bachata. I try to stay true to what I do.”  Meanwhile, the CW’s breakout hit Jane the Virgin has been taking the TV world by storm. The one-hour nighttime drama, loosely based on a Venezuelan telenovela, is hilarious and heartbreaking by turns. The quirky twists of Jane’s life are delivered in a whimsical, self-aware narrative voice, a direct shout out to the French film Amelie.  Amidst a groundswell of rave reviews, Jane the Virgin has been described as “one of the most authentic things on TV.” Lead actor Gina Rodriguez called it her dream role.  “My household is very similar”, Rodriguez said. “As an actor, it’s very hard to find a story like yours unless you write it yourself … I read this script and thought OK, here we are giving so much more. We are the heroes.”  Rodriguez, who turned down a role in Lifetime’s Devious Maids because it reinforced stereotypes, points to the bilingual intergenerational banter in Jane the Virgin: “The concept of my mother speaking to me in Spanish and me responding in English – that is my upbringing to a T.”  That aspect jumped out at me when I first started watching. As Backstage notes: “the show includes Spanish dialogue with subtitles but without issue or apology.” Watching it, I feel like I’m at one of my tíos’ houses in Miami: layers of language and meaning intertwine with family history and the complicated, hilarious tangles of today.  Like Jane the Virgin, Romeo Santos jumps freely back and forth between English and Spanish, drawing on whichever idiom can best describe what he’s speaking of. The question of translation here isn’t so much about picking one language or the other as it is about voice. Both Santos and Jane the Virgin have found a voice that speaks directly to the 54 million Latinos in the US without condescension or pandering.  That honesty, of both language and experience, are what propel the work beyond even their target audience, drawing in global attention. And it’s deserved. Art is at its best when it refuses to translate itself or cater to the lowest common denominator. As Santos has said about his own desire to take over the world: “Even if they don’t like it, I want them to know who I am.”  This article was amended on 25 May 2014; Romeo Santos was born in New York, not the Dominican Republic.

The issues debated and decisions made this year will determine how we are governed, and who by, until 2020. This is the first general election in which I will be able to vote – I am 20 this year – and I am looking forward to finally having my say. Having been studying and writing about politics since the last election, I am more than ready to do so. Many others are not. I am lucky to be studying politics at university; it means I am surrounded by people who care a great deal about what is happening in the world around them. Many of my peers are activists for parties and campaign groups, or, like me, write on issues we care about. Whether chatting before lectures or having a drink in the evening, there is always the possibility of discussing current affairs. Heated attempts to put the world to rights are not uncommon. And yet so many young people are disengaged. While apathy is spreading across countries and demographics, the problem is most acute in young adults. According to an Ipsos Mori poll, just 44% of 18- to 24-year-olds voted at the last election – fewer than any other age group. There is little to suggest that the figure will improve this time round. Even on campus, many react to my degree choice with a declaration that they “don’t do politics”. And across the country as a whole, young people have lost interest, at once apathetic and disenfranchised. Not caring, yet feeling neglected by those in power.    ‘Russell Brand is in a privileged position; his wealth and fame afford him influence whether he votes or not.’ Photograph: James Shaw/REX   It shouldn’t be so. Russell Brand may speak to young people’s disillusionment with his claims that there is no point in voting, that the parties are all against us, and that we need a revolution which he can’t describe. But his is a privileged position; his wealth and fame afford him influence whether he votes or not (how else did he make it on to Newsnight?), and most young people possess neither of these attributes. He also misses the critical rationale and benefit of democracy: that expressing your opinion can create change. As long as you actually express it. Young people, in fact, have more reason to vote than most. We are the generation saddled with £27,000 of student debt for degrees taken in vague anticipation of jobs that don’t yet exist. When we graduate, it’s into a lacklustre job market where skills are undervalued (many are expected to work for free), with the daunting prospect of struggling to pay the rent for years to come – if we can afford to leave home at all. We are the generation who in 20 or 30 or 40 years’ time will have to deal with the effects of climate change, poverty, mass depletion of resources. Forget the financial crisis, we will be living with housing, food and energy crises all at the same time, because politicians are not acting now to prevent them. Still think we don’t need to vote? If it bothers you that Nick Clegg was able to backtrack on the infamous tuition fee pledge, or that pensioners are insulated from austerity while young people bear its brunt, ask yourself why this is the case. The answer is simple: pensioners vote, and we all know that politicians are merely vote-counters when it comes to election promises. As long as young people remain disengaged, it won’t pay politicians to answer to our issues. Turn up on 7 May, and lend political currency to your opinions.    ‘If it bothers you that Nick Clegg was able to backtrack on the infamous tuition fee pledge, ask yourself why this is the case.’ Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA   Voting is, however, simply not enough, especially if the “X” in the box is assigned at random. In order to make an informed choice, young people need to be better educated – both at school and of their own accord through engaging with the media. We are in the historically unique position of having every conceivable piece of information at our immediate disposal, and yet we share more funny videos of cats than comment pieces. We should be harnessing the power of social media to have a generation-wide conversation about how to answer the future’s problems. That way, when we go to vote, we’ll be expressing well-thought-out opinions. Because until we take ourselves seriously, and act like it, politicians won’t either.",profile/lucy-webster,Lucy,Webster

They are all Good Vibrations. I wondered last year why Jeff Beck of all people was on tour with Brian Wilson. I had him down as a denim-clad blues guy. He is so much more than that. Listen to Nadia played live, a delicate recreation of Nitin Sawnhey’s song from the 1999 LP Beyond Skin. Beck’s use of the vibrato bar on his Fender Stratocaster (having abandoned use of the plectrum in the 80s) is exquisite. All Indian singers look up to the great Lata Mangeshkar who recorded more than 5,000 songs in a long career matched only by her sister Asha Bhosle. Her vocal technique is stunningly expressive here sympathetically joined on Wada Na Tod (Don’t Break Your Promise) by shimmering strings, wavering flutes and quivering organ work.  Luther Vandross’s finest performance is probably his cover of the Bacharach tune A House Is Not a Home. The quivering plea for his lover to be at home makes my eyes water every time I hear it. I have heard very few singers utilise vibrato with such taste.  In the late 50s and early 60s is was illegal to record a tune without a guitar twanging around with vibrato. On the Everly Brothers’ Price of Love from 1965 we get harmonica, guitar reverb and two voices singing so clearly and with such harmony that a kind of natural vibrato occurs between all four instruments. Magic.  Vibrato singing is treasured throughout the Mediterranean, transcending cultures, borders and religions. Mor Kabasi is of Moroccan and Persian heritage, born Israeli, currently living in Spain and singing in the Sephardic tradition – the music of the exiled Jews of Spain, in a language called Ladino.  Looped guitar, fuzz, tremolo, phasers set to stun. My Bloody Valentine layered guitar effects on top of guitar effects to create the classic shoegaze wall of sound adored by the post-punk generation. A revelation to me, as I’d never really listened to them properly before.  More recent guitar shudder echoes from my headphones as Radiohead thunder into Planet Telex and a shiver goes down my spine. What a thrilling song this is. You can force it but it will not come. Everything is broken … Radiohead made prog rock acceptable, where Pink Floyd once ruled. From their magnum opus Dark Side of the Moon comes On the Run, genius early electronica that goes from speaker to speaker, like the music accompanying a nightmarish video game. This is an instrumental that tells a story. LFO were formed in 1988 when Mark Bell and Gez Varley met in Leeds. The Low Frequency Oscillator – a synthesiser function – dominates their early rave techno hits including the Leeds Warehouse Mix of their first single LFO. Mark died in 2014 having worked on seven of Björk’s albums as well as his own electronic music. Mongolian throat singing is quite extraordinary. Its human mimicry of nature’s sounds is essentially overtone technique – singing two notes at the same time, one vibrating deep in the throat. Check out Khusugtun and their recent song Mongol.  No track made me happier this week than John Martyn’s Small Hours, taking me back to student life in late-70s London. I chose the live version because there is a wonderfully captured warmth in the room.  And finally yet another discovery – the English singer Kathleen Ferrier. Das Lied Von Der Erde (6th mvmt pt 3), written by Gustav Mahler in 1909 is such an extraordinary piece of music that it melted me.  So many more superb nominations. Shame I couldn’t choose them all.

59,2015-01-01T12:09:23Z,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/01/new-year-political-messages,New year: the season for grandstanding,commentisfree,Opinion,The Guardian,"Something strange has been happening with new year. The midnight toast was once an occasion for personal resolutions, honoured as much in the breach as in reality. With the advent of broadcasting, the turn of the year was embraced by leaders as an annual excuse to connect over the airwaves with their people. I remember when the Queen's Christmas broadcast enjoyed a monopoly of seasonal communication in the UK and the Commonwealth. The religious, not the secular, holiday took precedence. In the UK, set-piece salutations from the prime minister, leaders of political parties, the Archbishop of Canterbury and so on, are a relatively recent phenomenon. Still more recent, though is the way new year messages across the world are increasingly treated as a pretext for international initiatives and grandstanding. The growing international significance attached to the holiday (which is not a holiday everywhere) may have something to do with the competitive edge satellite broadcasting has brought to national festivities, with the ooh-and-aah factor of fireworks almost a gauge of global standing. This year a Sky News presenter said of London's pyrotechnic celebration: ""London stands shoulder to shoulder with some of the greatest cities of the world."" (Come on, only ""some of""?) Woe betide any country that does not have an instantly recognisable national symbol (the Sydney Harbour Bridge, St Basil's Cathedral, the Brandenburg Gate or Edinburgh Castle) to provide a distinctive backdrop. In London for some reason – perhaps safety? - the incomparably recognisable Big Ben has ceded its place as the fireworks scene-setter to the upstart Eye. But then London has underestimated its global appeal for almost as long as I can remember.  The new element is that leaders of pretty much anything – nations, churches, political parties, you name it - seem ever more reluctant to leave us alone with our champagne for the duration. Not only do they feel the need to make statements, they have also become less and less satisfied with mouthing the same old platitudes. They actually want to say something. So instead of waking up to a blank morning of non-news, today we were yanked into consciousness by a host of voices all vying for our attention. There was David Cameron warning of the ""choice"" Britain had, between ""the competence that has got us this far or the chaos of ... going backwards and taking huge risks"". There was the Archbishop of Canterbury, miraculously transported from his sick-bed to the National Arboretum, to pay tribute to fallen soldiers, but also to plead for more national generosity to the suffering, not just at home but abroad. In Germany, Angela Merkel used her message to deliver a fierce attack on the growth of anti-Islam sentiment, while Vladimir Putin gloried in Russia's ""recovery"" of Crimea, but in a more conciliatory note also harked back to the spirit of the second world war alliance with the US and the UK. From Australia, Tony Abbot promised better roads, more jobs, and a fitting commemoration for the centenary of the Gallipoli landings.  And there was a surprise in store from, of all places, Pyongyang. Not only was the world treated to a transmission of North Korea's national firework display, but also to a message from a very much alive Kim Jong-un to the effect that he sees 2015 as a year of domestic reform and wants fresh talks with the South. We shall see what we shall see. But with Cuba, and now North Korea, perhaps coming in from the cold, there is promise, amid the gloom, for 2015.",profile/mary-dejevsky,,Dejevsky
60,2015-01-01T12:30:10Z,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/oliver-burkeman-column/2015/jan/01/detoxing-debunked,'Detoxing' has been debunked. Maybe it's time to debunk that,commentisfree,Opinion,The Guardian,"A few years ago, probably the most irritating thing about New Year’s Day was running into people who couldn’t resist telling you about their January detox plans: how they’d decided to spurn alcohol for a month, eat only raw foods, undergo a juice cleanse, subsist entirely on superfoods or expel liver toxins by means of special yoga poses. These days, though, there’s a competing source of irritation: people gleefully informing you that detoxing isn’t really a thing. Surely you’ve heard the news? It’s been debunked! We live in the Age of Debunking: no sooner has somebody made a false or hyperbolic claim online (resulting in clicks) than someone else announces, with an air of triumph, that they’ve debunked it (resulting in clicks). I plead guilty. And often enough, debunking is a noble pursuit: the idea that we only use 10% of our brains, to pick one example, is flat wrong, and people who believe it ought to be corrected. No convincing evidence of a Benghazi conspiracy has ever been unearthed. Marie Antoinette almost certainly didn’t say “let them eat cake”. But the internet’s enthusiasm for a vigorous debunking now frequently spills over into what you might call the pseudo-debunk. Sometimes, this involves cynically claiming you’re debunking when you’re really just disagreeing – thereby implying that your opinion is more than mere opinion; it’s “the facts”. More common is the debunking of claims subtly different from those originally made. You may have learned, in recent months, that you can’t actually become a world-class expert in anything you like, merely by putting in 10,000 hours of practice. But do you realize that nobody really said that in the first place? Which brings us to detoxing. It’s a tricky one, since there’s undoubtedly a lot of poppycock here and the occasional bit of truly dangerous advice. Your intestines aren’t coated with hardened plaque made of feces, so you shouldn’t get a colonic irrigation to flush it out. Extreme fasts can be hazardous. It is indeed “medically futile” to go liquor-free for a month, if you imagine that this will remove toxins from your liver for the long term. (In any case, flushing toxic substances from your body is pretty much your liver’s job description.) There’s little evidence that specific “superfoods” combat specific diseases. And sorry, but yoga won’t “rinse your spine”, whatever that means – though, now I dwell on it, my spine is starting to feel like it could do with a rinse. So far, so debunked. But there’s a risk of throwing out the baby with the toxin-infested bathwater. After all, what proportion of New Year detoxers seriously believe you can coax nasty chemicals from your body by means of special detox foot-pads? Every “dry January” proponent I’ve ever spoken to, meanwhile, was doing it to prove to themselves that they could make a decision about alcohol consumption, then stick to it. (When I’ve given up caffeine for weeks at a time, it hasn’t been out of a conviction that coffee pollutes the temple of my body; it’s because it heightens the pleasure of drinking it again afterwards.)  And while disease-specific superfoods might be a myth, nutrient-dense “powerhouse foods” like watercress and chard aren’t – though, shockingly, research suggests that blueberries aren’t on that list. Eat more of those very-healthy foods, and fewer fast-food cheeseburgers and potato chips, and you’ll probably be better off. But don’t forget to refer to it as “clean eating” in order to drive the debunker in your life into an entertaining rage.  Even if the only thing your January detox delivers is an empowering sense of being a person capable of making choices, rather than being enslaved to impulse, it might be worth it. You can certainly take things too far: believing that your environment and the contents of your fridge are out to poison you is a pinched and miserable way to live. But at its best, the age-old religious tradition of renunciation – found everywhere from Ramadan to Lent to Buddhism’s “five precepts” – isn’t about neurotically regarding pleasure as dangerous or shameful. Instead, it’s about voluntarily deciding to deny yourself certain easy forms of escapism and distraction, in the belief that facing up to reality without them, for a short time at least, might prove beneficial.  Don’t be an idiot: there’s no reason to start trying to survive on sunlight alone, or anything like that. But at the same time, don’t let yourself be debunked into abandoning your plans for a January light on beer and heavy on kale, celery and ginger. And whatever you do, please don’t try to debunk this column, which has been an effort at debunking debunking. If you do, you’ll be guilty of debunking a debunking of debunking, which, according to Mayan astrology, may trigger the Apocalypse. Happy new year!",profile/oliverburkeman,burkeman,oliver
61,2015-01-01T12:39:37Z,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jan/01/what-students-want-from-government-2015,What do students want from the government in 2015?,education,Education,The Guardian,"It seemed like the government was giving students an early Christmas present last month, when George Osborne announced the introduction of a postgraduate loan system. Of course, it’s a Christmas present that’ll help just a fraction of the student population - and it’s one they’ll have to pay back, with interest.  With lots of talk about the power of the youth vote in the run-up to May’s general election, politicians should be wondering what political gifts the rest of the student population would value. Here’s what students have told me is on their wishlists: Cheaper housing Benedict Churchus, a student at the University of Birmingham, wants rent control on student houses. “So much of people’s loans doesn’t go on living, but rather on just having a house,” he says. “University tuition fees are bearable because the student loan pays for them directly. The bigger problem is day-to-day living. I feel like I get a bit ripped off. In Birmingham, it seems there are several big companies that thrive on student rent.” Churchus wants a student rent package to be introduced that would include fixed prices for rent and utility costs, making housing more affordable.  Hannah Davenly, a student at SOAS in London, also highlights housing as a major issue, particularly for students in London. “My rent for a quite-nice-but-small box room in a shared house is £540 per month – which is an extremely good price for London.” To help with housing costs, Davenly says the government should build more affordable housing, and increase the maintenance loan, or subsidise housing to cover the cost of rent. “Certainly in London, it’s impossible to find accommodation that’s cheap enough for you not to have to work long hours while you study,” she says. Student finance reform  Jess Rome, a student at Durham University, says student loans need overhauling this year. “The system needs to be changed so that everyone going to university can access enough money in a way that doesn’t leave them with unpayable levels of debt. “Everyone should be allowed to access the highest level of maintenance loan. Rather than capping the amount you receive, the government could cap the level at which you can receive the low interest rates, using the current qualifying system.” At present, maintenance loans are means tested. While all students living away from home are entitled to a maximum of £5,555 per year, or £7,751 in London, those whose household income is less than £25,000 qualify for a government maintenance grant of £3,387, which doesn’t have to be repaid. Beth Vincent, a student at the University of Bath, agrees that the system needs reforming. “The way maintenance loans are decided seems a little unfair. I’m entitled to the minimum loan, but this doesn’t even cover my rent. “My parents aren’t super rich so don’t support me with extra money, other than the odd thing like a bus pass or gadget insurance. This means I have to be very careful with money, work through years of savings, and end up being among the worst-off people at uni,” she says. Free education For others though, free education is the key demand. Elliot Folan, a student at the University of East Anglia, says the cost of university is the most important policy that needs changing. “I’d ask the government to abolish all charges for higher education, including tuition fees and taxes, because education is a right that should be available to all – not a privilege that should be available only to the rich,” says Folan. Fairer admissions Katie Maloney from Norwich, who has just sent off her Ucas application and hopes to study sports science at university this year, thinks the university admissions process needs changing. “If the government wants people to apply to university, they shouldn’t make us pay to apply, on top of the extortionate amount for tuition fees. It’s simply unfair, especially since your application doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll be accepted by a university.”  Applying to study one course via Ucas currently costs £12, while applying for up to five different courses costs £23. Make universities democratic Hannah Forsyth, a student at the University of York, wants the government to help make the higher education system more democratic. “Abolish vice-chancellors and senior management and replace them with elected posts that are paid a reasonable wage – not £250k a year. “We also need to give students majority representation on all university committees.” This article was changed on 05.01.15 to remove gender-specific pronouns from references to Elliot Folan.

I used to think that was a bad thing. But then I encountered a horror while rummaging through my hallway closet last week: tucked behind a ski jacket and a crate of files was a collection of my journals from sixth grade through college. And each year, sometimes at the instruction of a teacher, I had written a letter to “Future Mary”. Reading them now felt as though my chubbier and more insecure teenage hand was reaching out to grab me as I lunge toward 2015. My journals were a chronicle in pink ink, accented by skull doodles, of my angst, my hopes, my observations, for just about every pubescent year onward. Teenage Mary’s world consisted of a usually rainy, multi-block radius around a small Oregon bedroom. She didn’t even know that high school was survivable. Every little thing marked the end of the world: the outcomes of crushes on boys whose faces I now struggle to remember, my parents never seemed to get it and an imperfect quiz result soured my shot at getting into college (and out of my hometown). Even the letters to myself, which were supposed to be filled with my hopes and dreams and the things that I thought I needed to remember forever were just a list of banal goals – “read more”, “be nice”, “world peace” – that I don’t remember caring about and probably discarded by Valentine’s Day, anyway Reading the letters and journals now, I feel a delicious irony. They weren’t about the future but were snapshots of me then, a glimpse into a frozen reflection pond. They are as emotionally evocative as Jack Handy sunsets and my grandmother’s abandoned embroidery projects. But confronting your past self in written form can deliver more personal insights than any platitudes can provide. Remembering who I was when I wrote them, how I was feeling, and how much I was grasping for depth and optimism taught me more than I thought it could. Uncertainty is difficult to embrace at any age and so our resolutions for the future are often just mushy platitudes for self-improvement that we easily abandon in that uncertain future. For the most part we get fatter and poorer in spite of our pledges to lose weight and stuff our savings accounts; we work too hard and take our loved ones for granted despite promising ourselves otherwise; we stay home and watch terrible television and wait for that unexpected thing to happen that will change us. Maybe, Teenage Mary was right, all along: rather than trying to improve myself now by looking forward, I’d be better off, every year, by looking back at where I’d been. So in lieu of New Year’s resolutions, I’m reclaiming my old tradition of writing a letter to my near-future self. I’ve taken stock of what 2015 promises: I’m grateful for friends, family and the opportunity to travel. My job is changing. I’m embarking on my first book tour. I’m going to paint my bedroom lime green. The plan is to jot all of that down on paper, seal it in a little envelope and shove it in a desk drawer. And then I’ll go to the gym.",profile/mary-pilon,pilon,mary

The feature pins what Twitter considers to be the best tweets to the top of a user’s timeline the next time they open their Twitter app or browse the website. It works in a similar manner to Facebook’s news feed, which presents status updates and posts in a ranked manner, not necessarily in chronological order. It is the first major Twitter feature beyond promoted tweets and adverts to sort tweets in a non-chronological fashion. “Every time you open the Twitter app, you’ll see something great,” Twitter said when it announced the new feature as part of its “Timeline Highlights” improvements. The “while you were away” feature is designed to preserve important tweets that could get drowned out by the rapid flow of tweets on a daily basis. More than 500m tweets are sent a day, with many users following hundreds of accounts, making Twitter timelines a torrent of rolling thoughts. User reactions range from delight and demands to get the feature sooner to confusion and frustration. A gradual rollout to more users is expected.  ""while you were away...""

First you argue that Labour will lose if Ed Miliband rejects the third way. You fear a situation “in which a traditional leftwing party competes with a traditional rightwing party, with the traditional result”. But then you say you have been misinterpreted. The words, though, seem pretty clear and you were always so good with words. And, apparently, at winning elections. But we both know it’s not quite that clear or that simple. The truth is that any Labour leader could have won in 1997 – by then the nation was heartily sick of the Tories. It was time for change. Your great fortune was that the leadership came up just when most of the Labour party was desperate enough to accept victory at any price. If he had lived, John Smith would have won in 1997 – not by as much as you, granted – but then your majority was too big, wasn’t it? I well remember crunching my way up gravel drives past BMWs in Enfield the day Stephen Twigg ousted Michael Portillo – oh, how we cheered later that morning. But in hindsight the wrong people were voting Labour. The tent was too big and you spent the next 10 years trying to keep the wrong people in it: the very rich, for example. What meaningful project includes everyone? It took me a while, but I eventually realised that you were scared of the electorate and the British establishment. Your New Labour clique always acted like gate-crashers at a party – waiting to be turfed out of office. Despite all the bravura performances, you were uncomfortable with power. It was as though if one seat or one newspaper editor were lost, the whole game would be up. There were two problems with your New Labour project – it wasn’t new enough and it wasn’t Labour enough. All you did was mash up the bureaucratic state (at least 100 years old by then) and the free market (even older). You were barely committed, if at all, to the politics of equality and solidarity – or, come to think of it, liberty – given the attempts to lock innocent people up for 90 days without trial. You were about one thing really, Tony – winning. Winning at any cost. And being a winner meant being on the side of other winners. Bush, the bankers, Murdoch. These were the people on top – so all you had to do was be on their side. And therein lay your biggest problem: the limited scope of your ambitions. Not for you the challenge of reshaping the world in line with a new vision for society. Not for you the job of shifting the centre of gravity by detecting and riding new waves of political and cultural energy. Instead, all you did was to focus-group middle England and give a few swing voters more of what they already had. You remark, almost with pride, that the population hasn’t shifted to the left – well, what exactly was your job as a political leader supposed to be about then? Had you not been so disdainful about anything remotely old Labour there would probably be much less support for Ukip now. True, you sneaked in some transfers to the poor in the shape of tax credits, and you introduced the minimum wage. But never with a political flourish, never with a sense of moral purpose. It was all stealth and no one knew why they were better off. As a result, the Tories could turn the clock back once they were in control again. Of course, this isn’t all your fault – it’s the fault of people like me and many others who let you get away it. British politics is now crying out for a real choice. A society that is more equal, sustainable and democratic. Miliband’s problem isn’t that he is too leftwing or not leftwing enough. His problem is that he is not yet as modern or as hopeful as he needs to be. However his leadership might need to change, it’s madness to think that a return to 1997 is the answer.

The Central Methodist Church in central Johannesburg became a haven for people fleeing political violence, especially in neighbouring Zimbabwe, but caused resentment among city authorities who blamed it for encouraging crime. Bishop Paul Verryn, who turned the church into a sanctuary for the destitute and homeless, denied that he had been ousted after 18 years. “Nothing has been forced upon us,” he said. “This is a decision I made under no external pressure whatsoever but I felt the time is right to move on to something different and new. It’s been a huge part of my life for a long time but I’m not bereft. A season comes and a season goes.” In 2000 the church began to take in a few dozen people who were too vulnerable to live on the street and soon attracted undocumented migrants from countries including Burundi, Rwanda and Zimbabwe. In 2008 xenophobic attacks against African immigrants and political turmoil in Zimbabwe saw the numbers of refugees in the church swell to more than 3,000 including over 100 unaccompanied children. “Many of them were quite desperate and despondent,” Verryn recalled. “That is what opened the doors. Many would come to this place having been tortured and seriously violated.” They slept in slum-like conditions on floors, stairs and pews amid broken windows and the stench of urine. Alcoholism, gang crime and diseases such as cholera were a constant threat and deaths not uncommon. But there were also notable achievements including a clinic, adult training workshops, fitness classes and a school which began in 2008 and last year achieved a 100% pass rate in every subject. The school will continue and is now seeking alternative accommodation. The number of refugees was around 460 on Christmas Eve, according to Verryn, and since then has dropped substantially, with the remainder being “asked to leave” rather than forcibly evicted. Many have moved to the nearby Soweto township or made other arrangements, he added. Verryn, 62, will continue to be a church superintendent in Soweto and work as an anti-poverty campaigner, while it is hoped the church he leaves behind, which never ceased running Sunday services, will undergo a renovation likely to cost millions. “It couldn’t just carry on indefinitely, forever. There’s no doubt the building has taken a hammering.”",profile/davidsmith,Smith,David
67,2015-01-01T13:25:31Z,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/01/serial-adnan-syed-exonerated-new-trial,Will Serial's Adnan Syed ever be exonerated or get a new trial?,commentisfree,Opinion,The Guardian,"Everywhere I go, I’m asked whether I think that Adnan Syed “did it”, whether he received a fair trial and whether he has any chance of getting his conviction and life sentence reversed. The answer to the first question is “I don’t know”; to the second, “no”; and to the third, “it will be an uphill struggle, but it is possible – largely due to the podcast itself”. So many people ask because they’re all talking about the remarkable podcast Serial, which documents the factual weaknesses – and strengths but mostly weaknesses – in the prosecution and conviction of Adnan Masud Syed for the murder of his former girlfriend, Hae Min Lee, in 1999 when they were both high school students in Baltimore, Maryland. Sarah Koenig, who narrates and co-produces the podcast, turned her reporting about the case into a worldwide conversation about justice, doubts and the limitations of the American legal system.  Koenig, who has re-examined almost every aspect of the prosecution’s case from multiple angles, came to an uncertain conclusion: she believes Syed is probably not guilty, but she can’t swear to it. The evidence she presents raises considerable doubts about the prosecution’s case, but also leaves open the possibility that Syed committed the murder for which he is serving time in prison. The facts of his case are fairly representative of several dozen homicide cases I’ve handled over my 50 year career. Several weeks after Lee went missing, her strangled body was found in a shallow grave in a wooded area. There was no obvious physical evidence pointing to a particular suspect, so the police turned to her ex-boyfriend, Syed, and her then-current boyfriend. The latter had an air-tight alibi, but the former, who’d never been in trouble with the law, also seemed like an unlikely murderer. Then the police got a break. One of Syed’s acquaintances – a marijuana dealer named Jay, recently identified as Jay Wilds – claimed that Syed killed his ex-girlfriend out of revenge for the break-up she initiated. Wilds’ detailed account – which included the claims that Syed told him that he was going to kill Lee, that Syed then showed Lee’s body in the trunk of her car to Wilds, and that Wilds then helped Syed bury her – seemed to be corroborated by cell phone records. Though the specifics of Wilds’ incriminating account varied over time, the essence of his story remained constant: Syed said that he would kill Lee, admitted he killed her, showed Lee’s body to Wilds, and then buried Lee’s body together with Wilds. It was enough to secure a conviction, especially since Syed’s trial lawyer did a poor job of investigating the evidence and defending him at trial. For instance, she failed to interview a potential alibi witness and she didn’t press for forensic testing of hair and skin found on the victim’s body – either of which could’ve proved potentially exculpatory. The vital question for listeners now is whether the evidence discovered in the course of reporting the podcast – including some new evidence not known to the defense lawyer at trial – will get Adnan a new trial at which he could be well-represented and armed with evidence that could help him contest the prosecution’s case.  The answer is that current law is very much against him.  Once a trial is over and the jury has found a defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, it is very difficult to secure that person a new trial unless there were serious legal mistakes at the original trial. New evidence that casts doubt on the reliability of the conviction is viewed with skepticism – especially when the case has been unsuccessfully appealed and challenged in other post-conviction proceedings, as Syed’s was.  For example, there are even judges on the US supreme court, led by Justice Antonin Scalia, who seem unwilling to reverse even death penalty convictions even in the case of clear evidence of innocence. In the 2009 case of Troy Davis, Justice Scalia wrote:  This court has never held that the constitution forbids the execution of a convicted defendant who has had a full and fair trial but is later able to convince a habeas court that he is ‘actually’ innocent. Quite to the contrary, we have repeatedly left that question unresolved, while expressing considerable doubt that any claim based on alleged ‘actual innocence’ is constitutionally cognizable  It is doubtful that Scalia’s extreme view would command a majority of votes on the current supreme court, but it does illustrate the difficulty of re-opening legal cases in which there was a conviction based on new evidence. It’s even more difficult if that new evidence doesn’t clearly establish the innocence of the defendant, as, for example, new DNA evidence that points to another killer might. (A Virginia Innocence Project is now trying to have an analysis performed on hair and skin found with Lee’s body to determine if there is DNA that point to a different suspect.) In this case, the new evidence uncovered in the course of reporting the podcast in combination with the inadequate performance of his trial lawyer has raised doubts about Syed’s guilt in Koenig’s mind, in my mind and in the minds of many, but certainly not all, listeners to the podcast. Were I a juror at trial hearing this evidence, I would probably vote to acquit based on the totality of the evidence now available. But “beyond a reasonable doubt” – which is the standard for conviction at trial – is not the standard for granting a new trial based on newly-discovered evidence. The standard for granting a new trial varies from state to state, but is fairly daunting in Maryland – where the defendant has the burden of proving both that he could not have discovered the new evidence with due diligence at the time of trial, and that the evidence is likely to result in an acquittal in a new trial. So, unless more and better evidence of actual innocence can be found, I doubt that Syed will get a new trial based on the current challenge, which is currently on appeal. That’s a tragedy because, were Syed to be tried again with a good lawyer and the new evidence assembled, he might well be acquitted. But courts are often influenced by public opinion, and in the “court of public opinion” – as distinguished from the court of law – Syed is widely, though not universally, seen as the innocent victim of shoddy police work, overly aggressive prosecutorial conduct (and perhaps misconduct) and an inadequate (perhaps even unconstitutionally ineffective) defense. That widespread perception could lead the courts to resolve any legal doubts in Syed’s favor.  For many listeners there is enough doubt – both factual and legal – to raise serious questions about whether Syed’s continuing imprisonment is just, even if the legal system considers it “justice”.

So when an entire city centre had to wait for four minutes for a tram driver to get out of the way before festivities could start, it got slightly awkward. Deemed “excruciating” by one spectator, the lag in Manchester to join the rest of the UK in welcoming in 2015 followed a well-timed countdown aided by a giant clock in the city’s Piccadilly Gardens. “Five, four, three, two, one. Let’s have the fireworks!” ordered the show’s host, but after a massive roar, nothing happened.    In footage of the event, people in the crowd can be heard wondering where they are supposed to look, and sarcastically remarking: “Interesting fireworks!” At about 90 seconds past midnight, the host tells the 15,000-strong crowd there is a small problem. “Right folks, just a small hitch,” the announcer says to the sound of booing. “We’re just waiting for a tram to go out.”  Only in Manchester would you need to do three countdowns coz the tram was in the way of the fireworks lmao Happy New Year everyone!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉— Natalie Mallalieu (@Nathers_) January 1, 2015  He added: “Get out of the way of the fireworks, Mr Tram.” Organisers later confirmed that the tram had pulled into the firework “fallout” zone just at the wrong moment, halting the display for safety reasons. After another failed countdown and more booing, another person in the crowd can be heard saying: “It’ll be another three hours before this stupid tram moves.” Dan Thompson, an investigative journalist at the Manchester Evening News (MEN), described the wait as excruciating before the display, set to a soundtrack of Take That’s Greatest Day, finally got going in earnest.  So here in Manchester, the celebratory fireworks were delayed because a tram came into Piccadilly at midnight. *slow handclap*— Lynsey Spence (@Sidekick28) January 1, 2015  It is only the second year the city has held a pyrotechnic display in its centre. The council’s city centre spokesman Pat Karney told the MEN: “It was a fabulous Manchester crowd, the biggest we’ve ever had for a firework display. The tram delay added extra excitement and suspense to the occasion. I’ll leave it to the transport authority to check what happened.”",profile/shiv-malik,malik,shiv

I witnessed this firsthand about 20 years ago, when – after I’d already been helping to build responsible businesses, large and small, for some 20 years – I saw the creation of a special business focus called sustainability. Then came corporate citizenship and other labels.  The organizations I had worked to develop had never separated out – and, as a result, fragmented – the work of doing business responsibly. Responsibility was part of how they did everything, not a sideline. I think separating responsibility from business operations, while well-intended, ultimately caused setbacks.  But I finally see that well intended sidetrack reversing: 2015 is looking bright for responsible entrepreneurship. Three big shifts in particular that should give us hope:  1. Less counting, more caring Until recently, most reporting, consulting and corporate programs have used metrics to leverage responsibility. Managers figure out a way to count everything, believing a metric is the golden ticket to getting things done. The misguided notion of “what you measure is what you get” has been the mantra for decades. I don’t think it’s true. My mantra is: “What you get is what you care about.” Google, for instance, is making headway in changing our relationship with food. Instead of focusing on metrics, it’s finding ways to make people care about the impact of their food choices on farming, health and climate.  Via global dialogue and multidisciplinary projects, it aims to create food experiences and knowledge that brings those impacts to life in a more effective and powerful way than simply by sharing abstract numbers and statistics.  This approach has already born fruit: Google has set up its own community-supported agriculture deals directly with local farms in Northern California. If Google and other companies can get more people to care, that could make it possible to scale for organic farming, resulting in real systemic change. 2. Less copying, more innovating The sustainability movement unwittingly has borrowed many bad ideas from the traditional business world. Chief among them is the idea of “best practices.” Copying others’ practices has the tendency to commoditize the same approaches rather than creating unique ones that are relevant to each situation and business. For example, most companies have separate programs and standards for goals such as water conservation, fair trade, green building, energy efficiency and more. But focusing on the individual numbers in each category isn’t enough to make a business create real change. Being a fair trade brand is a baseline for being a good business; not a differentiator.  What I hope to see more of in 2015 is the shifting of entire systems through innovation. I’m already seeing some signs this trend is growing: take Merida Meridian, a small US textile design company that has been changing the rug industry with unique designs and products that exceed sustainability and fair-trade standards.  The company creates healthier communities in places – such as Brazilian villages – where it sources woven, dyed materials. It supports the unique artisan skills that were being lost to commodity sourcing. And the designs themselves stand out: Merida Meridian is now considered a “go to” source for top interior designers around the world.  It would have missed all that commercial and social success if it had simply pursued the best practices in its industry.  3. Fewer substitutions, more game changing  2014 may have been the year of the social enterprise , but many social enterprises operate on a small scale. If we want to see true progress, these companies will need to think bigger.  While most social ventures offer product substitutes for conscious consumers, they leave more than 97% of the market to more irresponsible options. Or they focus on solving a single problem rather than changing the system that produces the problem. Most, so far, haven’t been disruptive enough to change their whole industry. But that transformation, I hope, is coming.  Community Sourced Capital of Seattle, Washington, is changing the financial system that affects small business investing and local economic vitality in its area. In particular, it’s taking on the impersonal relationships banks often have with their communities.  Here’s how it works: local residents make interest-free loans to local CSC-member businesses – which are vetted by CSC – to buy equipment and grow. The investors are investing in the neighborhood, as well as the business. They are deeply connected to the neighborhood businesses and care if it is succeeds. CSC is changing both an industry and a social system.  If more social enterprises find innovative ways to change systems, they could end up doing far more good.

The reason for the change of plan is simple: its audience has hit its lowest point since 2005 and it finished third in cable news behind Fox News and CNN. The decline in tradition television audiences across the board has been affecting cable and network channels since the turn of the decade with former nailed-on winners such as ABC’s Modern Family losing viewers. But the one advantage MSNBC has over its competitors is its ability to attract a diverse audience, and especially Latino viewers. Latino viewers are an increasingly important demographic for all networks. The Nielsen Company found that Hispanics in the US have over $1 trillion in purchasing power and represent more than half of US population growth between 2000-2010. Bi-lingual homes where both Spanish and English are spoken currently watch about 50% Spanish-language television, while English-dominant Hispanic households watch a mere 3% of Spanish-language TV. In other words, television networks need to win over this audience if they want to make up the shortfall left by formally loyal absconders. But at the moment few networks are catering for Latinos specifically. “Everybody – cable or broadcast, news or entertainment – lacks the same thing,” says Alex Nogales, president of the National Hispanic Media Center (NHMC), a media advocacy and civil rights organization for the advancement of Latinos. That “thing” is Latino executives who can guide and drive programming and talent decisions to best reach that specific audience. Nogales believes that while every network genuinely wants to have a foothold among Latinos, they continually fail to deliver the type of programming that those audiences want.  “I know they want to do the right thing for the business reasons behind it,” he said. “They see us, they know the numbers – but they haven’t really executed in terms of programming for Latinos.” And the business reasons Nogales alludes to are significant. Hispanic women in particular represent a particularly sought-after advertising demographic. A 2013 Nielsen report shows that while Hispanics in general represent $1.3 trillion in purchasing power, it is the female members of Hispanic households that are driving purchasing decisions. That purchasing power is expected to reach $1.5 trillion in 2015, with Latinas expected to be 30% of the total female US population by 2060. Latino viewers are not just critical for cable news, but for scripted programming as well. ABC’s overt attempt to target a Latino viewership with the sitcom Cristela has seen a major ratings win for the network. The show, helmed by comedian Cristela Alonzo, is the number two most-watched new comedy of the fall TV season. (Interestingly, it is ABC’s Black-ish, an attempt to speak directly to African-American viewers, which is the season’s top new comedy). As a result of the NHMC’s Memorandum of Understanding signed by the networks, they are now required to publish annual statistics on diversity and employment. The NHMC also published report cards each year, grading the networks on the presence of diversity shown in scripted and reality programming, as well as in writing, directing, and producing positions. According to the data gathered by the NHMC, Latinos made up 8% of regular characters on primetime broadcast scripted new and returning series in the fall 2013 television season. Furthermore, Latinos were only 3% of guests in cable news shows, Latino TV writers are underrepresented by a factor of four to one, and Latino TV producers are underrepresented five to one at the executive producer level, and nearly 30% of all television shows have no minority writers on staff. But when it comes to increasing viewers, the need for securing a Latino audience is not just a politically correct pander, but a financial necessity. Cristela may have drawn a large audience but the breakout critical hit was the CW network’s, Jane the Virgin. After series star Gina Rodriguez received a Golden Globe nomination the show saw a 20% bump in viewership for its winter finale episode, which garnered 1.3 million viewers. In comparison, network heavyweight The Voice earned only 2.9 million viewers for NBC for it’s season finale, and NBC’s new Katherine Heigl-helmed drama State of Affairs had 1.6 million viewers.  MSNBC has recently added Telemundo anchor Jose Diaz Balart, a Cuban-American, to their roster but as Nogales asserts, the networks have some way to go before they get it right.  “There are negative stereotypes left and right – and they still occur,” says Nogales, “You have to include us to make sure you’re not creating stereotypes that blow up in your face. You have to know our sensitivities and then know how to proceed.”  One can only assume that the network realises that should it wish to rise above its competition in the cable news landscape, that means telling the stories that matter to people outside the echo chambers on either coast. As Nogales put it, “This is not a time for niceties – you have to do something. Stop standing in front of the elevator and saying, “You first,” “No, you first.” It’s time to just get in the elevator already.”",profile/jennifer-gerson-uffalussy,jennifer,gersonuffalussy
72,2015-01-01T14:30:00Z,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/01/taylor-swift-spotify-feud-nashville-new-york,The year Taylor Swift said goodbye to Nashville – and shook off Spotify,music,Music,The Guardian,"This was the year in which Taylor Swift went big city on us. Just before releasing her fifth album, 1989, the 25-year-old singer announced that, after a decade in Nashville, she had decided to leave behind Music Row for Manhattan. Then, to make it clear that she and Nashville are never, ever getting back together, Swift told the world she now wants her music to be thought of as pop, not country. Nashville’s many country-music purists rejoiced. But the queen of kiss-off songs was kind enough to leave the Music City a parting gift. She started a feud with Spotify, the top streaming service. Upset over her royalty payments, Swift not only withheld 1989 from Spotify’s servers; she also asked the company to stop streaming her previous albums. Swift’s label, Big Machine Records, claims to have received less than $500,000 from Spotify in the 12 months prior to her music coming down. The service said it could have paid out $6m for Swift’s music in 2014 had she allowed it to stream her new album. Even taking into account the cut taken by Universal, which distributes Swift’s music, the gap between the two sides’ figures is substantial. Yet the decision appears to have paid off for Swift. Her new album sold 1.3m copies in its first week, becoming the first album released in 2014 to go platinum. It was also the best one-week performance by an album in 12 years. And 1989 has continued to sell well since, having spent five weeks in Billboard’s top slot. (The other two weeks the album has been out, it ranked second in sales.) Spotify, for its part, has managed to shake the controversy off. Though Swift was one of the service’s most popular artists, the company’s chief executive spins the row as having generated good publicity for his site as it fights for market share with competitors such as Pandora. Swift was in a strong position to make such a power play. As the most popular artist on an independent label, Swift could dictate the terms for her album’s release. And as often mocked as she may be, her songs of teenaged angst have a large and loyal following. The girls for whom Swift’s music is written – and the parents who shop for those girls – are almost certain to buy it in any form Swift chooses, especially with its release coming so close to Christmas. Swift also has the advantage of playing to a fanbase that has been late to adopt streaming. Perhaps because of slower download speeds and spottier internet service in rural areas, country-music fans continue to be major listeners of radio and buyers of CDs. One can imagine her core audience catching Blank Space or a previous hit over the airwaves while driving to pick up 1989 at the nearest Walmart. But it isn’t clear Swift’s attempt to stand athwart the march of technology will have a lasting impact on the music industry. She says she’s been thanked privately by fellow musicians, but it’s far easier to cheer from the sidelines than enter the fray. While Radiohead’s Thom Yorke pulled music from Spotify before Swift made her announcement, only Jason Aldean, a country singer with similar relationships to his label and to his fans, appears to have followed her lead. Unless more pop and hip-hop artists take up the banner, Swift’s tiff with Spotify will be remembered as just another of her spoiled relationships, not the beginning of a revolution. Maybe now that her divorce from Nashville has been finalised, she should patch things up with Katy Perry.",,,

Panzi hospital in Bukavu, set up in 1999 by Dr Denis Mukwege, said it could no longer withdraw money or pay December wages to its 500 employees. Mukwege survived an assassination attempt in 2012 and recently spoke out about insecurity and bad governance in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which has failed to lift millions out of poverty despite vast mineral resources. Authorities have slapped a $50,000 (£32,095) monthly tax on the hospital. Patient Bashombe, a lawyer for the facility, said it had been accused of tax evasion even though “no public hospital in DRC has ever paid tax”. He accused the authorities of hounding it, adding: “Seizing the hospital’s accounts is illegal.” Dr Désiré Alumeti, who works at the hospital, said: “We do not understand this singling out, which appears to aim to stifle the Panzi hospital and the invaluable work we are doing for the Congolese people. We need a viable explanation from the authorities. It is abnormal that Panzi hospital is the only public hospital in Congo to have its accounts seized by the government.” Dozens of hospital workers with banners calling on the government to “Free our money” and “Stop hounding Panzi hospital” staged a sit-in on Wednesday outside the tax office in Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu province. Ruger Buhendwa, who was among them, said his family had not been able to celebrate Christmas because his salary had not been paid. “Tomorrow, New Year’s Day, will be the same,” he told Agence France-Presse. The Congolese government spokesman Lambert Mende refused to comment on the case, saying it was a judicial rather than a political matter. Mukwege, 59, is the founder and medical director of the Panzi hospital, where he and his staff have helped to treat more than 30,000 survivors of sexual violence by militias in the country’s volatile east. He has been described as the world’s leading expert on repairing injuries of rape, and has criticised the government’s failure to end impunity for attackers. His work has earned numerous international awards including the UN human rights prize, King Baudouin Africa development prize, African of the year, Olof Palme prize and Clinton global citizen award, while the Carter Foundation has named him a “citizen of the world”. He has also been nominated for the Nobel peace prize. In November, receiving the European parliament’s Sakharov prize, he said: “Our country is sick but, together with our friends around the world, we can and will heal.” Vava Tampa, founder of the UK-based pressure group Save the Congo, said: “This is part of a pattern of harassment against Dr Mukwege, and part of a wider onslaught against human rights defenders, journalists and opposition activists in Congo.”",profile/davidsmith,Smith,David

Louis van Gaal made no attempt to sugarcoat United’s poor performance on an afternoon when Stoke City were left to lament some suspect refereeing from Michael Oliver, poor finishing from Mame Diouf and the moment when the woodwork denied Peter Crouch a possible winner. After six successive victories prompted talk of United joining the title race, Van Gaal has now endured the frustration of watching his side draw three of their past four matches. The United manager has railed against the manic festive schedule – the sight of Ashley Young pulling a hamstring in the second half strengthened his argument about the dangers of the fixture pile-up – but the Dutchman had no complaints about the result here. “I think Stoke City deserved the victory more,” Van Gaal said. Stoke played with courage and belief and on another day could easily have reprised last season’s 2-1 home victory over United. Crouch was a constant thorn in the visitors’ side. He set up Ryan Shawcross’s opening goal after Phil Jones was caught ball-watching, had a strong penalty appeal turned down when Chris Smalling clearly handled and headed a free-kick against the upright. Marko Arnautovic also produced one of his best performances in a Stoke shirt.    Radamel Falcao celebrates Manchester United’s equaliser in their 1-1 draw at the Britannia Stadium. Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images   United looked flat. They had almost twice as much possession as Stoke but did little with it. Radamel Falcao’s first-half equaliser was one of only two United shots on target all game. There was a lack of penetration on the flanks, their buildup play was pedestrian and United looked like a team crying out for an injection of pace. At the other end of the pitch, Chris Smalling, Jonny Evans and Jones never instilled confidence. The draw stretches United’s unbeaten run to 10 matches but Van Gaal is much more concerned by another statistic: only two wins from their past 12 league games on the road. “I’m not interested in a period of unbeaten … we have to win away games and we didn’t do that,” the United manager said. “I think Stoke were closer to the victory, with the ball on the post and the first chance from Diouf they had two major chances and we didn’t create so much in spite of the time and space. We could pass the ball quicker, I don’t think that one cross was good. And also I think the last pass from our midfielders was not good.” Mark Hughes was full of praise for his players and bitterly disappointed with the referee. The Stoke manager claimed Oliver could have pointed to the spot on two occasions – the second when Robin van Persie tangled with Geoff Cameron after Crouch’s header hit a post. He had a stronger case with Smalling’s handball. “Certainly the first one, I think Smalling has lost Peter on the initial header and is just trying to get something in the way of the ball. He’s made an intentional movement with his arm to bat the ball down. The referee is clearly standing there, so why he hasn’t given it I don’t know.” United could not have made a worse start. The game was only 106 seconds old when Arnautovic delivered a corner that Crouch met with a free header. Jones was too preoccupied with Arnautovic’s centre to notice that Shawcross had got away from him and by the time he got his bearings the Stoke captain was volleying home. Then came the Diouf chance, when the former United player used his pace and strength to get past Evans only to profligately shoot wide. “Two-nil to the good we would have been in a situation where I don’t think United would have been able to come back given the way they performed,” Hughes said. Instead Falcao plundered an equaliser for United seven minutes later, when the Colombian turned in a Wayne Rooney corner that Michael Carrick flicked on at the near post – the 11th time this season that Stoke have conceded from a set piece. United might have been expected to push on from there but they ended up riding their luck.

The son of Elizabeth (nee Pritchard) and Francis, a diplomat, Simon was born in Ethiopia and educated at Stonyhurst college in Lancashire, before studies at Balliol and St Peter’s College, Oxford. He became an academic historian, lecturing first at Leicester University, before arriving in Cambridge to work at what is now Anglia Ruskin University. His socialist politics took him to the Labour party and he was first elected to Cambridge city council in 1983. In 1990 he became leader of the council. He was known for his exceptional intellect, but his style as leader was also characterised by an acute sense of humour. To his seat in the council chamber he sometimes took a homemade device comprised of a red flashing light linked to a button that would be pressed at key moments during debates. He called it his bullshit detector. Offputting to political opponents, it was one of many attempts to bring a light-hearted dimension to the drudgery that sometimes afflicts local politics. Simon also became known for his annual April Fools’ Day press releases. One involved the announcement of a monorail scheme to combat Cambridge congestion, running above the historic city streets. The main city-centre terminus was to be built outside King’s College. He stood down from the city council in 1995 and resigned from the Labour party the following year due to, among other things, disagreements with the policies of Tony Blair. His left of centre passions undiminished, he joined the Socialist Alliance and then the Green party, where I knew him as a fellow campaigner. For the Cambridge Greens, he became a central figure, leading the strategy for the 2010 general election campaign, which saw the party triple its vote in the city, and achieving the third-best result for the Greens in the UK. The year before, he was elected to the county council, as the first and only Green so far to serve in that forum. Aside from his political activities, Simon collected the work of local artists and was active with several voluntary organisations, including the American Air Museum at Duxford. He was a cook, too, producing a repertoire of fine vegetarian dishes that fuelled many Green party events. Simon is survived by his wife, Hilary (nee Taylor), and their three sons, Owen, Evan and Hywel, and a grandson. He lived with his partner, Alison Litherland, and her two children, Chris and Lexi.",profile/tonyjuniper,Tony,Juniper
76,2015-01-01T14:56:19Z,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/01/wellcome-trust-investment-chief-plays-long-game,Wellcome Trust investment chief plays the long game,business,Business,The Guardian,"For a large endowment fund with a seemingly conservative approach to investing, the returns generated by the £18bn Wellcome Trust are extraordinary. The gain for the past financial year – 15.4%, or £2.5bn – continued a run that stretches back years. Over the past six years since the financial crisis, the trust has generated 81%, or £9bn. That equates to 10.4% per annum, roughly the trust’s 20-year average. Since the start of the investment portfolio in 1985, the average is 14% a year. It’s clearly no fluke. What’s the secret? One short answer is long investment horizons. “We are an asset owner not a fund manager,” says Danny Truell, chief investment officer. “We buy businesses, we don’t buy share prices. When we buy a business we enter into, and we maintain, a targeted return over the next decade and we are indifferent to short-term mark-to-market movements.” Two remarkable statistics illustrate the point. First, Wellcome Trust’s 31-strong portfolio of shares in “mega-cap” multinationals – one of the main pillars of the investment strategy – contains exactly the same names as two years ago; no company has been added or removed in that time. Second, the adventures into the spicier worlds of venture capital and private equity do not end when the companies go public. Wellcome Trust has never sold a share in a flotation. Thus stakes in Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant, and Twitter – acquired when those firms were smaller and private – remain in the portfolio. Can anybody invest like this? Or do you have to be part of an organisation that dates back to 1936 and Henry Wellcome’s creation of the Wellcome Group, owner of the drug company that eventually created the first $1bn drug (Zovirax) in 1981 and was then sold to Glaxo in 1995? “I think is predominately a mindset,” says Truell. “It is a mindset that believes that compounding cash flows over time is the most effective form of investment. It is partly also the mindset of the organisation. I have a board that consists mainly of very eminent scientists who are very empathetic to the view that you make progress over years and decades, not over the next quarter.” The endowment exists to fund medical research. Grants last year totalled £690m. Thanks to the recent strong investment performance, the trust now expects its charitable spending to be £4bn in the next half-decade, up from £3bn over the past five years. Investment style If the investment style is so successful, why don’t more pension fund trustees, who by rights should also be looking to the long-term, copy it? “The [pension] fund trustees may wish to think long-term but when they are investing through managers who they are judging on a short-term view that’s where there can be a breakdown between the intent and the outcome,” says Truell. Truell also chairs the World Economic Forum’s long-term investor council, which comprises some of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds and state pension funds. “I think it is fair to say that all are moving in the direction of how to be genuinely long-term investors and how they also get more control over their own destiny by doing things directly rather than through third parties,” he says. The Wellcome Trust itself is managing a greater portion of its assets directly but still uses up to 50 partners in areas where it feels it has no expertise, such as early-stage venture capital, running hedge funds or investing across many classes of assets in Asia. “There are skills that we have and there are skills that we don’t have, and we are fairly hard-nosed about identifying them,” says Truell. The early investments in Facebook, Twitter and Alibaba came via contacts at such partners. The valuations of some of those firms strike many people as stratospheric but Truell is sanguine. The share prices of Twitter and Alibaba “ran a bit too hard” after IPO and he thinks short-sellers in the hedge fund world have done a good job in spotting froth: “You saw in March this year there was a bit of a bubble and, actually, the hedge funds did a good job in pushing prices down to more realistic levels.” He argues that Facebook and Twitter (where Wellcome’s holdings were worth £102m and £194m respectively at the end of September) are very different businesses. “Facebook is a platform. It’s got that global penetration. Twitter is about content, which if it works, is more valuable than platform. What it must not do is downplay the quality of its content. Challenges “The world is working through the question, ‘Is it about the number of people who tweet, or is it about the quality of what is tweeted?’ There was a period when it was about the former, and I think it is moving towards the latter. Though, clearly, as you have seen in 2014, Facebook has done well and Twitter has not done well. There are always going to be challenges to these businesses but, if they get it right, potential valuations are by no means demanding.” At Alibaba (a £115m holding at year-end), outsiders’ worries tend to focus on corporate governance and the fact the management own businesses in a private capacity that trade with the public entity. Truell suggests part of his confidence stems from having been invested in Alibaba since 2011. “We would say that no company can say it is absolutely free of governance issues but the fact is that they are at least cognisant of them.” The bulk of the “mega-cap” portfolio is concentrated in longer-established names. UK-listed companies include Marks & Spencer, HSBC, Shell, Vodafone, BP, Unilever, GlaxoSmithKline, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton. Tobacco companies are the only ones excluded on ethical grounds. Some environmental campaigners would also like to see oil companies deemed off-limits by socially minded investors. Truell, however, starts from the premise that energy is essential to the global economy and argues that engagement is better than disengagement. “As far as we are concerned, it is not realistic that we can dispense with fossil fuels. If I look today at a company like Shell, which has argued in favour of the carbon tax, is making major investments into carbon capture, and whose revenues now come predominately from gas rather than oil, it is very important that we engage with companies to ensure that they are being realistic about the changes in the nature of the energy market.” In what circumstances does Wellcome Trust sell an investment? “It does not happen very often but essentially if we feel that a business model is challenged and the company is not responding.” Finnish mobile phone maker Nokia was an example. “It had produced very popular products and then it just lost its way and it got into internal turmoil about producing new products. And, unfortunately, in a sector like technology the failure to produce the right products is something that can be severely damaging very quickly. Fortunately we realised that in time and we exited the investment.” Strong returns  Despite the trust’s strong returns since the great financial crash of 2008-09, Truell suggests that the going is likely to get harder from here. “Valuations since then have moved from being depressed to being fairly to fully valued, hence returns from here will be driven by organic growth rather than revaluation,” he says. For the time being Wellcome Trust will retain its bias towards the US, which accounts for 60% of the assets and has been one big driver of outperformance in the past half-decade. He says it is “still unclear” how Japan will respond to aggressive quantitative easing. Europe is still “far away” from resolving its structural problems. “In many countries, including the UK, France, Spain and Italy, populist politics appear to have largely derailed progress in driving public-sector supply-side reforms to restore fiscal balance through greater efficiencies,” he wrote in the trust’s annual report. Thus both the euro and sterling are vulnerable to further falls against the dollar, he thinks. The Russian crisis developed after the Wellcome Trust’s year-end, but Truell is gloomy about prospects there. “I think it is quite difficult to see what they are going to do, and I don’t think we can rule out the imposition of capital controls. But they do have substantial foreign reserves so the real challenge is maintaining the credibility of the banking system. “So far we have seen the currency come under severe pressure but it does not appear yet that there has been a major withdrawal of deposits from the banking system and that is obviously the challenge. So it is making sure that there is liquidity in the banking system that is really the key to allowing the crisis to simmer down and let time have its effect. I think they have a credible cental bank governor [Elvira Nabiullina]. I think she is good.” Wellcome Trust has no direct investments in Russia and, by the sounds of it, that will remain the case. Instead, the most interesting new investment in the past year was the £249m purchase of the Co-op Group’s farms in the UK. It was a very Wellcome-type of deal – expand into an under-invested agricultural sector and take a “multi-decade” view of returns.",profile/nilspratley,Nils,Pratley

Being the only boy in a family of girls, Martin feels that he needs a compatible companion to direct him through his nonsensical life. And after his best friend Padraic recommends getting an imaginary friend, Martin chooses to take his advice on board but it doesn't quite go according to plan. His first attempt is overzealous goofball Loopy Lou but soon decides to exchange him for someone less preposterous - Sean 'Caution' Murphy. But will Martin ever reach his ultimate goal or simply continue to live his life in solitude?  This absorbing book is littered with hilarious narrative and jam-packed, laugh out loud jokes. Working perfectly in partnership with the text are Walter Giampaglia's splendid, comical illustrations which help to bring the story to life; the book simply wouldn't be complete without them. An engrossing and facetious tale, this semi-autobiography is a must read, beautifully simple and punchy in its presentation. But some aspects of the novel, such as when Martin is beaten up by the school bullies or is seriously considering pimping his sister, may be unsuitable for some younger readers.  But despite this it is a highly enjoyable and amusing read. Fans of the hugely successful Emmy award winning Sky series will not be left disappointed with this side splitting novel and neither will lovers of David Walliams' Billionaire Boy.4/5 stars • Buy this book at the Guardian Bookshop.

In many ways, that day is here. Sustainability ambitions are soaring around the world. Many government initiatives to fight climate change and deforestation were announced this year, including a raft of new ones at COP20 in Lima. Companies increasingly integrate sustainability into their value chains and triple bottom line accounting into their corporate governance. Powerful emerging technologies hold the promise of new, powerful sustainability impacts. But we still have a lot to learn about how to align our practices with these ambitions and getting the details of implementation right. Technology could help, but we have to learn to manage it effectively. 2014 saw the rise of drones as a commercial, non-military technology, collecting massive real-time data about forests, water resources and crops. This year, Rainforest Alliance worked to bring digital communications and data sharing to rural farmers so they can learn best practice from each other and provide feedback to companies on how their sourcing policies are working. Used correctly, this kind of data could help fight deforestation and water resource depletion, minimise agricultural chemical use, raise yields on existing cropland and spread sustainable practices. We haven’t yet decided how to regulate these technologies, or who gets to control these big data streams. Some big companies are already figuring out how to capture and exploit farm monitoring data for their own profit. In The People’s Platform, Astra Taylor documents how the internet’s promise of democratisation and open access for all has been redirected towards making billions for a few giant gatekeepers at the expense of the commons. If we want big data to help scale up sustainable practices and choices, and serve the common good, we have to adopt policies to channel it in that direction. I hope 2015 will be the year we get serious about that. 2014 was a watershed year for recognising the critical role of forests, agriculture and land use in fighting climate change and protecting biodiversity. The UN Climate Summit and COP20 called for halving deforestation by 2020 and ending it by 2030. In terms of cutting greenhouse gas emissions, that would be like taking all the world’s cars off the road. While it’s thrilling to see the UN process, governments and companies around the world embracing the goal of ending deforestation, it’s important to remember that ambition is one thing, but learning how to implement it is another. To achieve it, we need to do the hard, detailed work of transforming farming, ranching and forestry practices that drive deforestation. In Latin America, because of poor grass management, it takes a hectare (2.47 acres) of land to support one cow. With 200m cattle in the Amazon basin, and beef demand set to double, we must learn to produce more on existing ranchland using sustainable methods. Rainforest Alliance has certified the first sustainable ranches in Brazil to a new standard that can support up to six head of cattle per hectare while eliminating deforestation and other negative impacts. Declaring deforestation-free policies won’t change the fact that there’s no such thing as zero deforestation in forest supply chains. Virtually all forest products entail cutting trees, but we can achieve net-zero deforestation if we source them from producers who protect high value areas, manage working forests sustainably and replant trees. My wish for the coming year is that consumers, policymakers and businesses become increasingly familiar with these kinds of nuances and apply them to implementing sustainability goals. In 2014 we saw many welcome signs that sustainability ambitions are growing. My hope is we’ll continue the hard, detailed work of learning how to realise those ambitions in 2015.

It might take even more courage now that financial hard times will surely intensify state propaganda against supposed “traitors”. So Memorial, a human rights organisation that is a beacon in the fight for values in post-Soviet Russia, deserves admiration and support. This is an institution that has harboured some of the greatest names in Russia’s pro-democracy movement. It was founded in 1989 by the Nobel peace prize laureate Andrei Sakharov. It had on its staff an extraordinarily brave woman, Natalia Estemirova, who for years documented war crimes in Chechnya, until she was killed in 2009. Another Memorial figure, the human rights activist Andrei Mironov, died this summer when caught in crossfire while reporting in eastern Ukraine. The Russian supreme court has started procedures to try to close down the organisation. So can Memorial survive in 2015? Anyone who knew these amazing people – I did, along with other journalists who have covered Russia over the years – can understand what a huge impact the closure of Memorial would have. Simply put, it would be the silencing of free voices and a blotting out of memory. It would signal that Russia was indeed entering a dark age. But there is nothing inevitable about this. Many Russians treasure the legacy of Sakharov. And Europeans should be shouting out: Memorial is the deeper, thoughtful Russia – the one we like and respect.",profile/natalie-nougayrede,Natalie,Nougayrède

You brought 2014 to a close in spectacular fashion, by raising almost £330,000 for the nine mental health charities in our Christmas appeal. To be exact, you have now raised £329,427 in donations, gift aid and match funding. Thank you! We thought we would start 2015 by hearing from some of the people directly helped by your donations. These young people are supported by the Kidstime Foundation, one of the charities chosen for this year’s appeal.  Juliet, Kirsty and Uzma each have parents who live with bipolar, schizophrenia or severe depression. ‘They won’t come and kill you in the street; they’re just sad inside’ Juliet, 11, speaks about why she thinks people often don’t donate to mental health charities:   ‘When people see things about mental illness, they just think it’s kind of scary – they don’t think about the person, they think about what that person might be doing to another person’  ‘There is support for parents of children with disabilities – now we need to do it the other way around’  Kirsty, 20, speaks about the responsibility of caring for a parent with mental illness:   ‘Don’t deny young carers have that responsibility – that’s just how it is’   ‘It’s nervewracking – it puts a strain on you sometimes’  Uzma, 14, talks about why these young people need more support - and donations   ",profile/emma-e-howard,Emma,Howard
82,2015-01-01T15:45:55Z,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jan/01/idaho-walmart-shooting-fatal-combination-children-guns,Idaho Walmart shooting is latest example of fatal combination of children and guns,us-news,US news,The Guardian,"On 5 April, a two-year-old accidentally squeezed the trigger of a cocked and loaded .357-caliber revolver, which had been stashed under his mother’s bed for temporary safekeeping. It fired, and the bullet struck his 11-year-old sister in the chest, killing her. The week around Halloween was marked by three toddler-involved shootings, which injured two children and an adult. On 30 December, an Idaho woman was accidentally shot dead by her two-year-old son while shopping at a local Walmart. Such cases involving young children and firearms are shocking but not altogether uncommon in the US. Each year, dozens of children are killed in unintentional shootings; others pull the trigger, accidentally injuring and killing parents, siblings and friends. “These are preventable deaths,” said Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. “They’re tragic and horrible, but ultimately preventable. “This tragedy in Idaho needs to be the start of a serious national conversation about children and firearms. Because carrying a loaded gun in your purse while shopping with your two-year-old is a recipe for disaster. And in this case, the worst-case scenario played itself out.” There are no definitive statistics on how many people are accidentally injured or killed by children and toddlers who get their hands on guns. According to federal data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an average of 62 children aged 14 and under died each year in unintentional shootings between 2007 and 2011. But there is a caveat, explains Bob Anderson, chief of the mortality statistics branch with the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics. Anderson said it was not uncommon to classify unintentional firearm deaths in which one person shoots another as a homicide, even if police reports indicate the shooting was an accident.  “What this means is that we underestimate accidental firearm deaths,” he said, adding: “We don’t really have a good assessment of the extent to which we underestimate these.” There are studies that support the undercount, though they differ on the degree to which the figures are unreported. A 2013 New York Times investigation found that accidental shootings occurred roughly twice as often as the records indicate. Organizations like Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America advocate for stronger laws to punish adults if they fail to store a gun safely and a child is able to access it. Just under 30 states and the District of Columbia have laws that hold gun owners criminally liable if children get hold of their guns, though nearly half of those states require proof that the owner intentionally, knowingly or recklessly gave the child a gun, according to a report by Everytown for Gun Safety and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America.  The National Rifle Association has long opposed safe-storage laws, arguing that such measures address an inconsequential problem. The NRA’s position, as stated on its website, is that education and training are paramount for preventing firearm-involved deaths. There is also a push for Congress to fund research on “smart gun” technology – a concept of equipping firearms with fingertip recognition or RFID chips, for example – that proponents say make handguns safer. Proponents of such “smart guns” have said the NRA is the main obstacle to their development. “As the leading firearm safety organization in the world we are heartbroken when tragic accidents occur,” Jennifer Baker, the NRA’s director of public affairs, told the Guardian. “No other organization does more to teach safe and responsible use of firearms than the NRA.  “The NRA teaches people how to prevent tragic accidents from happening and has been successful in saving lives, while, the anti-gun groups like those funded by billionaire [former New York mayor] Michael Bloomberg exploit tragedy to push legislation that infringes on law-abiding citizens’ right to self-protection.”",profile/lauren-gambino,Lauren,Gambino
83,2015-01-01T15:59:22Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jan/01/manchester-united-defensive-failings-stoke-city,Manchester United’s defensive failings quieten Premier League title talk,football,Football,The Guardian,"Manchester United title contenders? You’re having a laugh, as they used to chant on the terraces. A team that fails to pick up both Peter Crouch and Ryan Shawcross at Stoke’s first corner, going behind to a classic Potters set-piece goal in under two minutes? A team with a backline so shaky that they could easily have gone two down midway through the first half, had Mame Diouf showed any sort of finishing composure after he had beaten Jonny Evans all ends up? Visitors who spent much of the second half under siege in their own penalty area, riding their luck on at least one occasion as Stoke pressed for a winner and were denied a clear penalty? United may be theoretically in touch with Chelsea and Manchester City at the top of the table but their momentum has slowed over the festive period, with draws against Aston Villa and Tottenham Hotspur, and while they are playing with more confidence than they showed at the start of the season they are not yet performing consistently enough to be regarded even as a sure thing for a top-four finish. This third away draw in a row was not one of those where United make all the running and the ball miraculously stays out of the opposition net. This was a point that almost flattered United, who could easily have left the Britannia Stadium with nothing. When Shawcross was asked afterwards if a draw was the right result he appeared nonplussed. Most people thought Stoke deserved a win, Louis van Gaal included. “At Aston Villa we were the better team,” the United manager said. “Today we were not.” The best thing that could be said of United’s display was that they achieved a better result than they gained last season, when they were beaten by a spectacular winner from Charlie Adam, and showed application and organisation in recovering from their early setback. It was significant that they equalised from a set piece of their own, because very few chances were created from open play. Geoff Cameron and Erik Pieters kept a tight watch on Ashley Young and Luke Shaw, so space on the flanks never really opened up for United’s wing-backs, and neither were Wayne Rooney nor Juan Mata able to find many ways through Stoke’s well-drilled backline by playing through the middle. Neither Young nor Shaw finished the game and you could see why Van Gaal gambled on Adnan Januzaj in search of more attacking adventure after an hour, even if the substitute’s first task after replacing Shaw on the left was to try to stop a rampaging Jon Walters from getting a cross in, never the easiest of tasks for the burliest of defenders. The slightly-built Belgian is certainly not that, Walters crossed with little difficulty and Phil Jones did well in the end to head away the danger without finding his own net. That was the beginning of Stoke’s most intense period of pressure, during which Chris Smalling was distinctly fortunate to get away with a clear handball in the area, Crouch struck a post and Diouf fired a volley narrowly over the bar. The Boothen End was incensed over Michael Oliver’s refusal to award a penalty against Smalling, and the home fans had a point. The ball only travelled a short distance from Crouch’s head to the defender, giving Smalling little chance of getting his arm out of the way, but if you contest a cross in the penalty area with arms raised you are asking for trouble and a goalbound effort was indisputably blocked by illegal means. It said a lot about United’s character that they not only survived the barrage but kept looking for a winner right up until the end. Being United, it was easy to suspect that they might get one too, but Rooney was not having one of his better games, Mata’s passing game was blown off course by the blustery conditions and when Robin van Persie turned up on the end of a good move in the closing minutes he could not keep his effort on target. A late winner for United would have been a travesty in any case. Van Gaal has improved the team, though not to the extent that they can easily cope with a wet and windy New Year’s Day in Stoke. “We knew it would be tough, we played them at home already,” Van Gaal said. “They are a well-organised team who play long balls very well.” He was not being dismissive there, just admitting the truth. United’s 10-match unbeaten run is still intact, but a long-ball team nearly rumbled them.",profile/paulwilson,Paul,Wilson
84,2015-01-01T16:00:02Z,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/01/films-of-2015-trailers-teasers-worth-the-wait,Films of 2015: they’re worth the wait,film,Film,The Guardian,"“Are you rushing or are you dragging?” barks the hard-boiled conductor during a tense early scene from the upcoming US drama Whiplash. Good timing is crucial for this taskmaster, and woe betide the drummer who dares to dawdle or to forge ahead. Falling behind just a hair holds everyone up, but jumping the gun in your eagerness to turn the page and find out what comes next inevitably causes problems of its own. Whiplash, it turns out, is one of a number of Oscar contenders tangentially concerned with the management of time. Elsewhere on the starting grid we discover Alejandro González Iñárritu’s Birdman (which affects to hold its breath during a single, uninterrupted take), Richard Linklater’s Boyhood (which unwinds at leisure over a 12-year period) and The Theory of Everything (in that Eddie Redmayne plays the author of A Brief History of Time). But it is the piledriving Whiplash that makes the issue feel most urgent. Miles Teller’s desperate, rushing drummer sets the tempo for the film year to come. Is January the best time to preview 2015, or should we mail this article back to 2012, when it might have been more relevant? When it comes to the movies, we’ve all been guilty of rushing, of getting ahead of ourselves, of gorging ourselves on the starters before the main course has been cooked. The future is now. Possibly it has already been partially consumed in the form of teaser trailers, exclusive stills and excitable nuggets of casting news and set reports. Over the past few months, for instance, I’ve seen so much content about the next Star Wars outing that it is almost a surprise to note that principal photography only finished in November. To all intents and purposes, the film does not exist. And yet already it feels like a foregone conclusion.    Press shots have been released for Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens, but the film doesn’t hit cinemas until the end of 2015. Photograph: Allstar/Disney/Lucasfilm   Thank heavens, therefore, that the opening months of 2015 provide us with some tangible pleasures. January alone sees the UK release of a brace of potent US crime dramas in Bennett Miller’s Foxcatcher and JC Chandor’s A Most Violent Year. Best of all, we have Paul Thomas Anderson’s freewheeling Inherent Vice, a film that makes a jubilant virtue out of chaos and confusion. Jump forward slightly further and we alight on further bounty. Kornél Mundruczó’s White God is an antic parable about a canine revolution in modern Budapest. Peter Strickland’s The Duke of Burgundy swans in to provide delirious art-house erotica, while Roy Andersson’s A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence rustles up a deadpan metaphysical burlesque featuring two travelling salesmen who just “want to help people have fun”. I would unstintingly recommend that you see every one of these films, and you may already have done so, since they all played at festivals during 2014. These movies, in other words, have been screened and reviewed and chewed over at length. They are what Donald Rumsfeld might refer to as the “known knowns”. Rushing further through the year, we eventually reach the “unknown knowns”; those films that we know are there but have yet to spot. These include Thomas Vinterberg’s version of Far from the Madding Crowd, Ben Wheatley’s High-Rise, Sacha Baron Cohen’s hooligan comedy Grimsby and Sam Taylor-Wood’s adaptation of Fifty Shades of Grey. The august lions of US cinema are represented by Martin Scorsese’s missionary drama Silence, Ron Howard’s disaster epic In the Heart of the Sea and the espionage thriller St James Place, directed by Steven Spielberg from a Coen brothers script. Elsewhere, the multiplexes are poised to throw open their doors to receive the likes of Jurassic World, Ant-Man and Avengers: Age of Ultron. Extensive details on these unseen delicacies can be found on thousands of fan sites. If we are guilty of rushing, who is setting the pace? Undeniably, journalists must shoulder some of the blame – hurrying to steal a march on their rivals and thereby spoiling the fun for everyone else. But let’s not rush to judgment: the hacks are at least aided by the diehard fans constantly clamouring for an inside track, and by the studio marketing departments that spew all manner of preview content in a surreal, pre-emptive attempt to fashion a word-of-mouth hit out of an unfinished film. All these tribes are racing one another, at high speed, towards the point where the anticipation of a film becomes more important than the simple thrill of discovery.    The Theory of Everything, a biopic about Stephen Hawking starring Felicity Jones (left) and Eddie Redmayne, is released on 1 January. Photograph: Allstar/Working Title Films/Sportsphoto Ltd   Is there room in the dock for a fresh set of culprits? In launching their cyber-attack on Sony Pictures, the self-styled Guardians of Peace provided a backstage melodrama that could put Birdman to shame. Like Iñárritu, they pulled back the curtain on an exploded set of backbiting and gossip and works in progress that should really not have been seen. Yet, at the risk of blaming the victim, the Sony Pictures hacking scandal was merely making hay from a condition that existed already. Put bluntly, if there were not such a desperate desire to see (the then-unreleased) Annie or the Oscar-tipped Still Alice, or to peruse the first pass at a script for the next James Bond movie, then the cyber-attack would have risked falling flat. Project yourself still further into the future. Alarmingly, one finds that the schedules are filled. Nowadays, the studios talk in terms of “mega-franchises” and “movie universes”, and their development slates extend for years. If you like planning ahead, here are some dates for the diary: X-Men: Apocalypse is booked for US release on 27 May 2016, The Justice League Part One for 17 November 2017; we must wait until May 2018 to see Avengers: Infinity War – Part 1, and a further two months to witness The Amazing Spider-Man 3. Just typing those titles, I swear I felt my anticipation levels peak, plateau and start sliding south. All of which makes the existence of Boyhood seem more extraordinary still. Like the big studios with their mega-franchises, director Richard Linklater mapped out his project years and years in advance. Unlike them, he was largely content to keep his creation under wraps. There were no leaks, no drip-fed images, no updates from the set. Instead, he was able to work on in quiet, in stages, banking on the assumption that nobody would die and that the world would still turn – and that, all said and done, it is the journey that matters. “How do we plan for our own futures?” Linklater wondered idly last summer. “You do your best, but you live in the present. All you can do is keep marching towards it and adjust yourself as the reality shifts.” On the cusp of the new year, I’m taking those words to heart. There is no point in rushing, or setting your clock by the previews. The films of 2015 sit just over the horizon. Some of them will be great and some of them will be bad; all of them will be here in their own, sweet time.",profile/xanbrooks,brooks,xan
85,2015-01-01T16:10:38Z,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/01/arts-graduates-skills-creative-money,Easy to sneer at arts graduates. But we’ll need their skills,commentisfree,Opinion,The Guardian,"Anthony Ward Thomas, of Ward Thomas Removals, has a problem that he shares with the public. After a life spent turning a man with a van into a multimillion-pound firm, he finds his children are not interested in taking over. “They have different interests,” he says. He is sad, but agrees “there should be no divine right that they get the business”. They should make their own way in the world. This they are doing. His daughters are country and western singers and his son is an actor. I doubt if they are as rich. When penal supertaxes were ended in the 1980s, the surplus spending power was expected to go on cars, yachts and houses. Much of it did. But a new form of supertax emerged, no less insistent than the last. It was called children. And not just any children, who might look after their parents in old age, but ones seeking a life of fashionable but impecunious “creativity”. Statistics say the chief cost of child-rearing occurs in the teens. To get an offspring housed, clothed, fed and educated to the age of 21 takes an average of £225,000, or half a million if privately educated. This has more than doubled over the past decade. But ask most parents, and the expense does not stop at 21. It continues through further education, travel, internship, ongoing board and lodging, even early marriage. Thousands the world over are returning to live at home after university. Australians have “boomerang” children, Italians bamboccioni (big babies), the Japanese parasaito shinguru (parasite singles) and the Germans “hotel mama”. To the youth psychologist Haim Omer, this “entitled dependency” has become “the new hedonism … an ideology at the parents’ expense, nothing less than a pandemic”. Behind this phenomenon stands the famous “bank of mum and dad”, notably in the matter of housing: its motto is “pay up or we stay”. In Britain this bespoke baby bank reportedly hands out a staggering £27bn annually. The loans have nothing to do with investment. The bank would go swiftly bust if they did. Money is spent, above all, on property. A trivial £600m is reckoned to go on business ventures. The bank is too proud to fail. The Ward Thomas branch of this bank is more specific. I am not privy to the family’s circumstances, but if the bank is like many I know, it existed to fund careers in “something creative”, often what the parents once called a hobby but their children consider a talent in need of full occupational rein. This bank of mum and dad becomes a private arts council, far outstripping the resources available to the real one. A cultural economist might welcome this. It forces down pay and costs in the arts, making it cheaper to run literary festivals, music venues, provincial rep, galleries and publishing. Children are far more expert at extracting “grants” from parents than is the Treasury; HMRC has no clout to compare with “Edinburgh could be our big break, Dad”. But the phenomenon has consequences. It biases “subsidy”, and the jobs to which they give access, towards the children of the rich. It also seriously distorts higher education, with a booming demand for courses in drama, dance, fine art, music, film, photography, design and creative writing. Britain now has 160,000 undergraduate and postgraduate students in “creative arts and design”, with more than 20,000 in drama alone. This is more than in the whole of engineering or in maths and computing combined. This academic bias is far beyond what the market for such skills can sustain. Just 28% of graduates in performing arts find jobs in the arts or media, while almost the same proportion find their way into retail and catering. Britain’s bursting drama schools are training a better class of waiter. Does this matter? The lethargy afflicting Japan’s once-tiger economy over the past decade is attributed to precisely this career demotivation of the post-salaryman generation. Young Japanese have been able to afford to turn away from their parents’ grinding labour and its karoshi, or death from overwork. A similar collapse may one day afflict Chinese entrepreneurialism. Even the continued vitality of the US and Germany is attributed not to natives but to migrant talent drawn from less favoured countries. Europe is in the economic doldrums. It may produce the best opera singers and write the best novels, but its cars and computers are rubbish. Its bankers can hedge markets and its tour operators can market hedges, but the funds come from Asian enterprise. Either it will discourage its young from dancing, film-making and creative writing and galvanise it to risk-taking innovation, or it will slither into becoming a gigantic Bournemouth, living off the dwindling fat of its past. So says the economist. Or should we put more faith in the dynamic of a humanistic education? Graduates in the performing arts are actually high achievers in finding work outside their skill group, probably through enhanced confidence and articulacy. They take chances and do not regard money as everything. They seem better equipped to use their imagination and challenge conventional wisdom. The pop science bestseller Sapiens, by Yuval Noah Harari, suggests that humans “are now beginning to break the laws of natural selection, replacing them with the laws of intelligent design”. Human advance through natural selection has reached its limit. Strides forward will now be technological rather than biological. For Harari the question for our species is not “what do we want to become?”, but the far harder question, “what do we want to want?”. Who makes the choices? The answer will not lie in the brave new world of cyborgs and robots. It can only lie in what are rightly called the humanities, the history and imagination of human beings. Alexander Pope was always right: “The proper study of mankind is man.” Most British adults now believe their offspring will be poorer than themselves. Yet millions indulge their children in careers they know will yield neither financial reward nor national advantage. I am not convinced the world they are creating will really be worse off for that. There is plenty for the robots to do, like running removal firm. • A secondary picture was removed from this article on 5 January 2015.

He said that following Tuesday’s decision to split by the producers of the 10 Beaujolais cru wines, he ordered the cancellation of the Concours des Grands Vins du Beaujolais in case tempers boiled over at the end of the wine-tasting and awarding of medals. The contest had been scheduled for 9 January. The row risks being portrayed as a kind of class warfare, pitting the best wines grown on the northern slopes of the Beaujolais region in Burgundy against the southern vineyards where the cheaper Beaujolais Villages and Beaujolais Nouveau are produced. “Class warfare? More like a war caused by spoiled children,” said Chilliet. The Beaujolais cru winemakers, who produce such brands as Fleurie and Brouilly, have accused the UVB of “dragging down” the best wines and failing to promote them sufficiently, which Chilliet denies. The decision by Audrey Charton representing the Beaujolais crus, took the UVB by surprise. “We worked side by side for months, with no animosity, and then this came like a bolt from the blue,” Chilliet told the Guardian. “Apparently they think that if they do everything themselves they’d be better off.” Charton was not available for comment on Thursday. A family member said that she was “trying to cool things down”. The UVB and the breakaway group have agreed a three-month truce which will give them time to see how to proceed and to examine the financial implications. The Beaujolais crus intend to set up a new group, saying that the UVB is outdated with “goals, concerns, expectations and organisations which are increasingly different among the two families”. Some winegrowers suspect that the Beaujolais crus may eventually hook up with the Burgundy wine trade. But Chilliet said: “Isn’t it better to be a big fish in a small pond, rather than a small one at the bottom of a big pond?” He said he hopes for a solution with the breakaway winegrowers in the coming weeks, “but after all that’s happened, it will be difficult to pull back from the brink”.",profile/anne-penketh,Anne,Penketh

Holly “Låpsley” Fletcher is an 18-year-old graduate of Liverpool’s Institute Of Performing Arts, BBC Sound Of 2015 nominee, signee to XL and exponent of haunting, late-night post-xx electronic balladry. Her songs are intimate and intense, slow-motion and sad, minimalist but atmospheric, allowing her rich, mature voice to feature prominently in the mix, full of sorrow and a weary experience that belies her years. Also, like Polydor’s rising star Shura, Tālā, Cooly G, Nightwave and several others, Låpsley is a fully self-contained artist who doesn’t just write, sing and perform her material, but produces it as well. Paul Lester    Other female pop stars to watch: Shura, Soak, Rae Morris. The British rapper George the Poet George Mpanga is a 23-year-old from the grim Stonebridge Park estate in north London and a politics graduate of Cambridge University. His politicised texts have been the basis for both performance poetry and raps. Idris Elba is a fan, Emeli Sandé, Paolo Nutini, Labrinth and Naughty Boy have all given him guest spots; and he’s supported Nas on tour. Add the fact that he was runnerup to James Bay for the Brits Critics’ Choice award and a featured artist on the BBC Sound of 2015 longlist and it’s hard to avoid the feeling that he is poised to become the best-known street-level poet since Benjamin Zephaniah, or even John Cooper Clarke. PL    Other UK rap/grime artists to watch: Stormzy, Krept and Konan, Cas Is Dead. The indie-dancers  Real Lies  Real Lies are a north London trio purveying dreamy electronic dance music that deals in the dirt of real life. Suited to clubs and gigs, it’s a little bit baggy and a little bit Balearic, harking back to the immaculately produced techno pop of New Order’s Technique. World Peace, their exceptional 2013 debut single (reissued on 5 January), is all acieed squiggles, shimmering synths and propulsive melancholy. Sometimes the vocals are of the boyish and featherlight sung variety, from the school of Bernard Sumner. Other times, as on their second single, North Circular, they are softly spoken, halfway between the picaresque poetry of the Streets and the whispered evocations of Neil Tennant circa West End Girls. PL    Other indie bands to watch: Nimmo, Wolf Alice, Gengahr. The metal band Abhorrent Decimation There are plenty of more accessible and mainstream-friendly bands vying for the metal world’s attention right now, but in terms of a fresh force that encapsulates the true spirit of the genre, London’s Abhorrent Decimation deserve to be the connoisseur’s choice. Ostensibly a death metal band, with all the flagrant brutality and guttural snarls that such an affiliation entails, they have more than enough groove and insistent hooks to lure in fans of Lamb of God and Machine Head while still ticking all the relevant boxes for fans of more extreme and uncommercial fare. Their 2013 debut EP, Infected Celestial Utopia, was as confident and distinctive a debut as I’ve heard in years, but judging by the quality of pre-production demos for the band’s forthcoming full-length debut – expected midway through 2015 – there is something genuinely thrilling going on here. The British metal scene is in a healthy state at the moment, but media attention tends to focus on bands that have an aesthetic reach beyond the underground, rather than grassroots acts that shy away from notions of compromise. Abhorrent Decimation certainly have the potential to outgrow their death metal roots, but it seems unlikely that they will do so by diluting the ferocity of their attack. And that’s a hugely refreshing prospect in these often banal and insipid times. Dom Lawson Other metal bands to watch:  Trepalium, Xibalba, Widow. The pop star (2)Shamir Shamir Bailey is a thrillingly promising, multi-talented 19-year-old whose androgynous countertenor has been compared to Prince-as-Camille, and whose dance music has the fluidity of Arthur Russell’s experimental disco as Dinosaur L. But you get the sense that this Las Vegas boy could dart off in any direction. His late-2014 single On the Regular had the rubbery bassline of late-80s acid house, while the tracks on his debut, Northtown EP, released in early 2014, was a varied affair that veered from the disco throb of If It Wasn’t True to the crackly, noir porch balladry of Lived and Died Alone (a cover of the track by Canadian country artist Lindi Ortega). To quote the late Lillian Roxon on Tim Buckley: “There is no name yet for the places he and his voice can go.” PL    Other male pop artists to watch: Years & Years, Pale, Prides. The experimental pop auteur Sophie Sophie is the name – one of the many pseudonyms – adopted by affiliates of PC Music, the label, coterie of likeminds and series of aesthetic principles established by the mysterious AG Cook, who refuses to reveal himself or give interviews. No matter, because the music speaks for him, and loudly: PC Music was one of the love-it-or-loathe-it sounds of 2014, an amped-up, super-sweet hyper-pop, a dizzyingly fast-cut, sugary blend of J-pop, bass, Euro-cheese and the sort of sounds you can squeeze out of any cheap laptop software these days. Sophie – whoever she (or he) is – may be the first breakout PC music star, or that honour may go to one of their other acts, such as Hannah Diamonds, Princess Bambi or the Lipgloss Twins. But either way this mangled Manga post-pop will be hard to ignore in 2015. PL    Other experimental pop acts to watch: Arca, Tokimonsta. The singer-songwriter James Bay With George Ezra and Hozier breaking through in 2014 (the latter had one of the two highest-debuting albums in the States last year), the door has been well and truly opened for the sensitive, male singer-songwriter. Enter James Bay, a 24-year-old from Hitchin in Hertfordshire (like that other hopeful, Rhodes) with a husky voice and an armful of rocked-up guitar ballads. His tours with Hozier and three EPs – The Dark of the Morning, Let It Go and Hold Back the River – helped gain him the Brits Critics’ Choice award, previously won by Emeli Sandé, Adele, Florence and Tom Odell. Already surely pencilled in: the 2015 John Lewis Christmas ad. PL    Other male singer-songwriters to watch: Rhodes, Freddie Dickson, Jack Garratt. The new new wave of new wave Public Access TV John Eatherly’s been making music for nearly a decade now, first as drummer of Be Your Own Pet, followed by stints as a sideman with assorted acts. Now he’s having a crack fronting his own band, Public Access TV. Their industry reputation – a deal with Polydor, tonnes of buzz – outstrips their actual popularity at this point, but Eatherly’s got a knack for tautly constructed guitar rock that sounds as if it’s come straight from 1979: there’s not an ounce of flab on the few songs that have surfaced online in the past year, including two singles that bounce along with a joie de vivre that suggests long dark nights of the soul and existential crises are not going to feature on Eatherly’s songwriting agenda in the near future. There seems to be a fair amount of this stuff coming from the US at the moment: expect a run on skinny ties in the sales. Michael Hann    Other new new wave of new wavers to watch: Broncho, Sheer. Mag, Rathborne. The American rapper  Raury This singer and songwriter is nominally a hip-hop artist, but he could just as easily be filed under dream-popper, troubadour, even soundscaper – he has the range, ambition, omnivorousness and some of the space-cadet charm of an André 3000, even a Frank Ocean. No wonder he’s on the BBC Sound of 2015 longlist and was picked by Lorde to appear alongside Tinashe, Chvrches, Grace Jones and Charli XCX on the Hunger Games soundtrack. His 2014 Wildfire mixtape was an index of possible futures for this 18-year-old ATLien, with forays into everything from slick, powerful synth-funk and ambient pop to symphonic, choral rap. PL    Other US rappers to watch: Bobby Shmurda, Vic Mensa, Vince Staples. The garage rockers  Slaves Ever since the White Stripes, the rock two-piece has been deemed a musically viable – not to mention economically sensible – unit for performing and recording. In 2014, Royal Blood became the UK’s biggest exporters of the form, and in 2015 the baton looks set to be passed on to Tunbridge Wells’s Slaves. Isaac Holman bashes the drums, standing up as he does so that he can also sing (or rather bellow), while Laurie Vincent is guitarist and co-vocalist. There is a rockabilly element to their racket, and a pilled-up bootboy approach to lyrics that means they hover near the Sleaford Mods category, making them seem more yob band than boy band. PL    Other rock bands to watch: DMA’s, the Districts, Sunset Sons.",profile/paullester,lester,paul

89,2015-01-01T17:00:55Z,https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2015/jan/01/books-of-the-year-2014,Books of the year 2014,science,Science,The Guardian,"It is New Year’s Day and I should be looking forward but I’ve been busy – and delayed by the flu – so I’m not yet done looking back. Listed below with potted reviews are the 23 books I read in 2014. This continues a tradition I started last year, when I decided to read less internet and more books. I have just about managed to stick with the programme, mostly by snatching time on my daily commute in and out of London. My daughter scoffed at my paltry annual tally and you may too but there it is. As you’ll see from the list, much as I love a good novel, my predilection is for non-fiction. That might be something to do with me being a scientist but the hypothesis is untested. 1. Protein Crystallography: a concise guide, Eaton Lattman & Patrik LollI read this for work, hoping to find inspiration for teaching this subject to my undergraduates. It does exactly what it says on the tin but is a book for devotees only. 2. Thinking Fast and Slow, Daniel KahnemanKahneman is an engaging navigator through the disorientating recesses of the mind and reveals that most of us blunder through life not properly realising how we are buffeted in our decision-making by all manner of subtle and unconscious influences. As I wrote in my review in February, ‘Thinking Fast and Slow hasn’t changed the way I think – yet. But it has changed the way I think about how I think.’ 3. Creation, Adam RutherfordIn a two-part book that reflects the complimentary strands of DNA Rutherford spins two breezy, inter-linked tales of genetic modification. The first looks back over four billion years to lay out our present understanding of the origins of life, while the second shows how we are beginning to use that accumulated knowledge to create new forms from nature with the emerging technologies of synthetic biology. It’s a relaxed, enjoyable ride through territory that looks set to loom large in the 21st century. 4. Carrying the Fire, Michael Collins When I was about thirteen I met Apollo 15’s Jim Irwin at the Armagh Planetarium and asked him how they decided which of the three crew members had to remain on the command module and didn’t get to walk on the moon. Irwin’s rather banal answer was that the decision was taken early in training. Michael Collins was that third man, the CM pilot on the Apollo 11 mission that landed Armstrong and Aldrin on the dusty surface of our lifeless satellite, but his story is anything but banal. I’ve not read a better first-person account of the Apollo programme. Collins recounts the training, the technicalities, the rivalries and the sheer bloody courage of those early astronauts with disarming candour.  5. Bring up the Bodies, Hilary MantelI had loved Wolf Hall and was captivated once again by the sounds and smells and intrigues of Henry VIII’s court as Anne Boleyn falls from grace. Mantel has an eye for detail and a skill for narrative that I find utterly convincing. I can’t wait for the third and concluding volume.  6. Curiosity, Philip BallThis is a fascinating exploration of the development of science, refracted unusually through the shifting concept of curiosity. Ball alights briefly among the ancients but picks up the story with authoritative detail once Leonardo da Vinci arrives on the scene. Curiosity is superb – replete with historical and scientific insight. I shall be forever in Ball’s debt for introducing me to “Mad Madge”, Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle. 7. Stick, Elmore LeonardMy first encounter with Leonard’s superior crime fiction. Slick. 8. The Man in the Monkeynut Coat, Kersten HallThe eponymous hero of this biography is William Astbury, one of the early pioneers of structural biology. In the 1930s his lab was the first to use X-ray diffraction to reveal clues about the internal structure of fibrous proteins and DNA. Astbury is a forgotten man outside the corridors of academia because the structural analyses that finally succeeded in deciphering his data were done by Pauling, who figured out the geometry of the alpha-helices and beta-strands within protein molecules, and by Watson and Crick, who were the first to conceive DNA’s elegant double helix. Hall’s book provides a useful historical corrective to the notion that all scientists are heroes; some of them are disappointed men.  9. Smashing Physics, Jon ButterworthAnother first-person account, not of a journey to the moon but one to the bizarre heart of reality as we know it. Jon (my co-blogger here at the Guardian) had a ring-side seat as the Large Hadron Collider came into being, stumbled when first switched on and then, after careful repairs, gradually amassed the data needed to convince the world that a 50-year-old prediction of the existence of the Higgs boson was correct. Smashing Physics is an exciting and colourful story that barrels along at pace, though happily some way shy of the speed of light. In the end I was hungry for more; I have to confess that I still can’t quite get my head around the rules governing the creation of so many different types of particle when you bash protons together (hint, hint).  10. Little Science, Big science, Derek de Solla PriceI read this with my science policy hat on. De Solla Price’s short book comprises four lectures given in 1962 that used scientific methods to sketch the size, dynamics and character of the scientific enterprise over the past 300 years, during which time it became increasingly professionalised and state-funded. Though ground-breaking in its day, the author’s themes are now well-rehearsed. One for aficionados. 11. The Strangest Man, Graham FarmeloFarmelo’s biography of theoretical physicist Paul Dirac, whose likely autism did not prevent him becoming a central player in early 20th century theoretical physics, is masterful story-telling. Fear not the physics, which is skilfully rendered, but revel in a compelling and important piece of history.  12. Beyond Bibliometrics, edited by Blaise Cronin and Cassidy SugimotoThis weighty and scholarly tome considers whether there are ways to assess the quality of research by quantifying its outputs and impacts. I read it dutifully as a member of a working group that is currently examining possible roles for bibliometrics in UK research assessment for the Higher Education Funding Council of England, and wrote a review for Research Fortnight. This is a topic that warrants wider attention among the research community but my guess is they would prefer a snappier, cheaper digest. 13. The Great University Gamble, Andrew McGettiganIt is astonishing that the present coalition government has foisted on the UK a scheme for funding undergraduate students that has not been properly costed or debated in parliament. McGettigan’s book drills relentlessly into the detailed backstory of a policy that is still coming home to roost. His thoroughness means that The Great University Gamble is hardly an easy read but it deserves attention, not least because this is an issue that will preoccupy the government due to be elected in 2015. I hope that McGettigan will continue to provide informed comment on his blog.  14. The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, Carson McCullers Mr Singer is a deaf-mute who becomes an important figure for a variety of characters, each struggling with their own troubles in Georgia in the 1930s. The 1968 film of the novel, starring Alan Arkin, is the saddest I have ever seen. Though I came late to the book, it did not disappoint.  15. Stuff Matters, Mark Miodownik Materials scientist Mark Miodownik has constructed an imaginative romp through the marvels of everyday stuff: steel, paper, concrete, chocolate, foam, plastic, glass, graphite, porcelain and engineered tissues. Well, mostly everyday stuff. Miodownik repeatedly pulls novelty and surprise from familiar things which, along with the personal touches woven deftly into his narrative, makes for a joyful read. It is no surprise that the book has been winning awards.  16. Roger Bacon: The First Scientist, Brian Clegg I know enough history to be wary of claims that this or that person was the first to define a new category of human endeavour, but Clegg makes a strong and measured argument on behalf of the 13th century scholar, philosopher and Franciscan friar.  17. The Psychopath Test, Jon RonsonRobson threads his own anxieties through an investigation of psychopathy that starts with a puzzling manuscript sent to scholars around the world and leads to encounters with a strange cast of academics and psychopaths. Ronson is a brilliant storyteller – I was immediately hooked and breezed through the book in a couple of days. Strangely, by the end I found myself wondering if he might be too brilliant, too … manipulative? Maybe that’s just the side-effect of being too long immersed in madness? 18. Gilead, Marilynne RobinsonA dying pastor, having married late, recounts his life in a letter to his young son, still a boy. Beautifully written by an author in supreme control of her art, Gilead might at first seem beguilingly simple but it has a complex and fully human heart. This was the best novel I read all year.  19. Science and Government, CP SnowMy second science policy excursion, this time with a story focused on the war-time clashes between high-ranking government advisers Henry Tizard and Frederick Lindeman. Snow’s book remains a salutary warning of the importance of understanding the impact of personality in the machinations of government administration of science and resonates even today.  20. Risk Savvy, Gerd Gigerenzer Risk Savvy is a interesting complement to Kahneman’s book (see No. 2 above), even if the two authors don’t see eye-to-eye. It’s an easier read than Thinking Fast and Slow but no less interesting for all that in its analysis of how we so readily mis-calculate risks and probabilities. Gigerenzer also takes a more practical approach, frequently suggesting techniques for countering our mis-intuition. 21. The Simpsons and their Mathematical Secrets, Simon SinghEver since I heard Homer chastise Lisa for building a perpetual motion machine: “Young lady, in this house we obey the laws of thermodynamics!” I had suspected there was a rich seam of nerdiness running through The Simpsons. Singh mines it for all the scientific and mathematical gems worked into the show (and into Futurama) by the eclectic mix of writers. Mind-bendingly good fun.  22. The Quest for a Moral Compass: a Global History of Ethics, Kenan MalikMalik’s book is hugely ambitious in scope, tracing the development of moral thought around the world over the past four thousand years. I found it absorbing and magisterial. I wish this book had been around thirty years ago and suspect that I shall be returning time and time again to tap into its wisdom.  23. Star of the Sea, Joseph O’Connor This much-lauded novel, the story of a ship of refugees fleeing to America from the famine in Ireland, had sat on my bookshelf for several years. It was a crushing disappointment. I could not get past the artifice of O’Connor’s narrative construction – the book is supposedly assembled from documentary fragments by one of the main characters. Nor did it help that so many of the characters remained as flat as its four hundred pages.  @Stephen_Curry is a professor of structural biology at Imperial College, vice-chair of Science is Vital and a director of CaSE.

90,2015-01-01T17:00:59Z,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/01/france-thomas-piketty-legion-of-honour,France’s rock star economist Thomas Piketty turns down Legion of Honour,world,World news,The Guardian,"French economist Thomas Piketty has spurned the Legion of Honour, the country’s highest distinction, on the grounds that the government should not decide who is honourable. Piketty, author of the bestselling Capital in the Twenty-First Century, which has become compulsory reading for world leaders, added: “They’d be better off concentrating on boosting growth in France and Europe.” Piketty, 43, made the comments to Agence France-Presse after learning that he had been nominated for the rank of chevalier (knight), which rewards “eminent merit” demonstrated over more than 25 years’ professional activity. “I don’t believe it’s the role of the government to decide who is honourable,” he said. Others who received the Legion of Honour in the New Year’s Day announcement included French novelist Patrick Modiano, who won the 2013 Nobel prize for literature. Piketty is not alone in rejecting the award, which over the years has been turned down by many illustrious personalities including Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. The former leader of the pro-Socialist CFDT union, Edmond Maire, also refused, using similar language to Piketty, saying “it’s not up to the state to decide who is honourable or not”. In the past, Piketty has described the French president, François Hollande, who on Wednesday night boasted that the government had undertaken “grand reforms” in 2013, as “rather bad.” In his New Year’s Eve message, the Socialist president urged the French to seize the initiative to bring down unemployment while liberalising reforms are implemented. Addressing the business community, Hollande said that “our joint obligation is to fight unemployment”. In his latest work, the economist addresses the roots and consequences of inequality. He argues that modern capitalism leads to unsustainable levels of inequality, which then undermine the meritocratic values on which democratic societies are based. He says that concentrated wealth will increasingly be in the hands of those who already hold capital in the free-market economies, and warns of potentially explosive social consequences. Piketty was economic adviser to Hollande’s ex-partner Ségolène Royal in 2007 during her own bid for the French presidency. But during a red-carpet visit to Washington in April he complained that his ideas were better received outside France than in his homeland where he said he received a “narrowly political reception”. Capital in the Twenty-First Century was named business book of the year for 2014 by the Financial Times, and described by New York Times columnist Paul Krugman as “the most important economics book of the year, and maybe of the decade”. But the economist’s personal life also made headlines last year. It emerged last May that his former partner, Aurélie Filippetti, now the ex-culture minister, had lodged a complaint with police which led to him being investigated for domestic violence while they were in a relationship in 2009. • This article was amended on 2 January 2015. An earlier version incorrectly described chevalier (knight) as “the Legion’s top rank”.",profile/anne-penketh,Anne,Penketh
91,2015-01-01T17:01:15Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/01/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report,Alan Pardew needs firepower as Crystal Palace draw a blank at Aston Villa,football,Football,The Guardian,"Alan Pardew will aim to bring a new attacking dimension to Crystal Palace after witnessing them draw another blank on their travels. The departing Newcastle United manager is set to take over as Neil Warnock’s successor at Selhurst Park on Thursday night after going into the dressing room at Villa Park to congratulate his prospective charges on their latest hard-earned point, under Keith Millen’s caretaker charge, but to tell them they need to start creating more chances if they are to stay in the Premier League. Palace remain in the relegation zone, one point adrift of 17th place, after failing to score for the fifth time in six away matches in the league. An FA Cup trip to Dover Athletic on Sunday provides an opportunity for the current players to indicate they can fulfil the new manager’s remit to attack with greater potency while retaining the solidity with which Tony Pulis helped them stay up last season. Millen said: “He had no input in the game but came down to congratulate the players afterwards. He was pleased but said we need to add more to our game. We need to score more goals to stay in the division. “ He was pleased and proud. He has seen us play before so knows what we are about. He knows we need a different dimension. We need to add something else to our game.” Millen has been asked to stay on the coaching staff and is excited at what Pardew can implement. “I think he will bring passion and the fans will respond to that,” he said. “He has a knowledge of the Premier League. You look at his Newcastle team, they have flair. He will want to make us more attractive and exciting while keeping what we’re good at. I’m sure he will have talked to the chairman about transfers; we all know we need to bring in players.” Pardew’s name was on the car park list and everyone’s lips before the game as Palace’s manager in waiting came to evaluate his prospective charges before his impending appointment. He took his seat in the stands – alongside Kevin Blackwell, one of Warnock’s coaching staff, and behind Steve Parish, the co-chairman – back at the ground where he enjoyed his most celebrated moment in a Palace shirt almost a quarter of a century ago when scoring an extra-time FA Cup semi-final winner over Liverpool. None could doubt Palace’s resilience as they ground out another goalless draw to add to Sunday’s at Queens Park Rangers. With the bottom six all avoiding defeat, it was also a necessary point. Wilfried Zaha gave another anodyne performance that illustrated why Pardew will seek to sign a proven striker. Villa’s own goalscoring problems have been well documented, mainly because they do not appear in any danger of going away. They have failed to score in 11 of their 20 games, a run that includes four of their last five games, and in 39 of Paul Lambert’s 96 league games at the helm, a 40% failure rate that is the worst in the Premier League in that period. Even with the luxury of recalling Gabriel Agbonlahor to play in a three-man frontline with Andreas Weimann and Christian Benteke, who had scored the winning goal at Selhurst Park when these teams met a month ago, Villa still created scant chances. They certainly started very positively, Benteke drawing a sharp save low at his near post from Julián Speroni after a swift passing move from kick-off before Palace had touched the ball. Then Speroni posted a further reminder of his worth with a brilliant save in the same vicinity as Alan Hutton came dashing in, when a cross pinballed off Joel Ward, and looked certain to score. But Villa’s fortunes suffered a dip when Ron Vlaar, their captain only just returned from a long-standing calf injury, had to limp off with a knee injury after 14 minutes. “He fears it could be the same injury he suffered in the World Cup,” Lambert said. Pardew at least knows Palace have pace on the break, and when Zaha dispossessed Leandro Bacuna in the centre circle, Yannick Bolasie dashed away, past Ciaran Clark, only to lift his shot against the crossbar from the edge of the penalty area as he went face to face with Brad Guzan. But when Benteke scythed a shot just over from Carlos Sánchez’s pull-back and Speroni parried Bacuna’s swerving free-kick three minutes from time, the stalemate was assured. Villa are endeavouring to play a more expansive game, with the full-backs pushing high and wide and the excellent Sánchez covering in between, but they move the ball too slowly and allow opponents to block them off. “When you have that much possession, you have got to score when you create the chances,” Lambert said.

Although the presence of the Premier League’s leading troubleshooter in the stands at Upton Park was not quite enough to lift his new side to an unlikely victory over West Ham United, this was an encouraging first step in the right direction for West Bromwich Albion, who took heart from a display that belied their status as relegation candidates. On this evidence, they can be hopeful of staying up with a degree of comfort. It was a mark of how well Albion coped that the final whistle was greeted by a smattering of boos from the home fans, a harsh reaction when this result is placed into the context of what West Ham have achieved so far this season. There was a leggy feel to West Ham at the end of an energy-sapping run of games and there were complaints about them sending a few too many long balls in the direction of the ineffective Andy Carroll for the crowd’s liking. But the draw kept them within touching distance of fourth-placed Southampton and, in that sense, Sam Allardyce’s side are victims of their own success. Considering the shambolic state they found themselves in at the start of 2014, life could be worse. They could, for instance, be West Bromwich Albion. Something had to give after their 2-0 defeat at Stoke City on Sunday ended with their supporters in open mutiny and, putting it bluntly, no one was surprised when the news filtered through that Alan Irvine had been sacked on Monday night. There is no point sugarcoating the issue: Irvine was doomed from the start and the club had to act. The bloody-mindedness of Crystal Palace’s escape under Pulis last season has instantly restored optimism at Albion. Pulis, whose first proper match in charge will be when non-league Gateshead visit The Hawthorns in the third round of the FA Cup on Saturday, left it to Keith Downing and Rob Kelly to take caretaker charge, although his assistant, Dave Kemp, popped up in the dugout in the second half. Kelly said that Pulis offered his new players a few words of advice, before adding that much of the preparation was done by Irvine. It may well turn out to be Kelly and Downing’s final hurrah at the club, with Pulis likely to replace them with his own backroom staff. Albion will be disappointed that summoning the inspiration that might have brought them a first win in four matches was beyond them but this may come to be seen as a valuable point in the final reckoning. They are a point above third-bottom Palace and they were resilient when they had to be in the second half to stretch West Ham’s winless run to three matches. The fear for West Ham was that Pulis’s arrival would give Albion a new lease of life and the visitors played some pleasing football in the first half. Stéphane Sessègnon, whose tricky footwork and easy dribbling style would make him a genuine force if only he were more consistent, was a source of creative menace and his dash down the left three minutes before the interval created Saido Berahino’s equaliser. Albion displayed strength of character to recover from falling behind in the 10th minute, West Ham taking the lead with a beautifully crafted goal. Stewart Downing sent a searching pass sailing over Joleon Lescott’s head and Morgan Amalfitano was able to bring the ball down and find Aaron Cresswell, whose fizzing cross was headed into the far corner by Diafra Sakho for his ninth goal in all competitions. Yet Sakho later went off with a back injury and West Ham will suffer when he and Cheikhou Kouyaté head off to the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal next Monday. Allardyce also admitted that there is a chance that Alex Song could yet be called up by Cameroon after initially being left out last week. It would be a blow for West Ham if Song goes. They have misplaced their spark in the past week and there are concerns that it is impossible to replicate the flowing football they were playing a couple of months ago when Carroll, who is not the most mobile of forwards, is in their attack. Gradually Albion asserted themselves and Adrián had to make an outstanding save from Chris Baird’s surprisingly acrobatic volley, before West Ham were exposed when Sessègnon broke and rolled the ball inside to Berahino, who alerted any potential suitors this month to his qualities by coolly scoring for the first time in 12 matches. West Ham could hardly plead ignorance given that it was Berahino’s third goal in four matches against them and the closest they came to a winner in the second half was when Cresswell’s free-kick hit the base of Ben Foster’s left post.

Daughter of James Hogan, a salesman, and his wife, Mona, a nurse, Aileen was born in the Canadian capital, Ottawa. She grew up in Richmond Hill, Ontario, and went to St Joseph’s Morrow Park school in Toronto. After graduating from the University of Toronto, she worked at McMaster University with Phil Branton, the professor of pathology, in the early days of research into tyrosine kinases (enzymes involved in the development of cancer). She began her PhD in 1981 at the University of Western Ontario in the cancer research laboratory, which was where I met her. She was at the centre of a group of friends who worked hard and played hard. Aileen was a good-looking, independent woman, full of confidence. She had a typically Canadian spirit of self-reliance: she drove a huge old 6-litre Chevy Bel Air and had no qualms about changing a wheel by herself, alone, in the dark. She was a strong person, physically and mentally. We married in 1985 and moved to Britain, where we settled in Oxford. Aileen wanted to change fields to developmental biology and had won a postdoctoral job working on the genetics of the Drosophila fruit fly. After a year she switched again and became Rosa Beddington’s first postdoctoral researcher, working on mouse embryology. In Oxford, Aileen fell in love with England – its houses, gardens, its churches and history. But in 1989 we moved back to Canada, to Calgary, where Aileen took a job at the university. To her great joy, our children Lucy and Michael came along in the early 1990s and gave a new focus to her life. A six-month sabbatical back in Britain in 1996 was the catalyst to reawaken Aileen’s love for the country and so we came back, settling in Norwich. Aileen loved everything about being in the UK: the faster pace of life, the telly, the Guardian quiz, the sense of humour. She moved from bench research into science administration, commuting every weekday to Cambridge. By 2012 Aileen had started to be ill with what proved to be metastatic cholangiocarcinoma. Most friends did not know she was so ill, because she wanted simply to get on with life, behaving with customary grittiness. She is survived by me and our children, by her sister-in-law Sybil and nieces, Laura and Andrea.",,,

This time, however, they spared themselves another ordeal and it was another moment to demonstrate why the Premier League champions have leant on their sister club, New York City FC, to keep Frank Lampard in Manchester rather than Manhattan. They may not like it in New York but when Lampard is making such a rich contribution for Manuel Pellegrini’s team the decision-makers in Abu Dhabi can hardly be blamed for deciding to extend his stay and abandon the initial plan of making him Major League Soccer’s new poster boy. Lampard had been on the pitch only four minutes when he announced his presence with the fifth, decisive goal of a wild 15-minute spell that had felt utterly incongruous to everything that preceded it. It was his seventh goal for the club, despite largely being restricted to substitute appearances, and it is clear why City have been willing to risk a transatlantic PR disaster, which could conceivably get worse over the coming months. The awkwardness of what has happened – leaving one supporters’ group in New York proclaiming themselves to be outraged – will hardly be eased by Pellegrini letting slip that he could not guarantee Lampard would even move to the United States at the end of the season, and the revelation that the former Chelsea player does not actually have a proper contract in place with the club that announced him as their signing last summer. Yet what cannot be disputed is the wisdom of the decision for City, the Mancunian version. Lampard, even at 36, has made himself almost indispensable when he is capable of getting his team out of a hole in this way. After 66 minutes, City had looked as though they would coast through the final exchanges, courtesy of a majestic shot from Yaya Touré and a delightful finish nine minutes later from Stevan Jovetic. Instead that was the cue for Sunderland to ditch their ploys of conservatism and, lo and behold, discover that City are vulnerable when they are put under pressure and missing their captain and chief organiser, Vincent Kompany. Gus Poyet later apologised for “boring” the crowd in the first 45 minutes and maybe in hindsight the Sunderland manager will regret not setting up his team to be more adventurous from the start, especially when Willy Caballero was in the opposition goal and had looked so erratic earlier in the season. Joe Hart had been given a day off, perhaps owing to a couple of mistakes in his past two games, and a more ambitious side might have done more to test Caballero.    Manchester City’s Frank Lampard celebrates after scoring the third goal against Sunderland. Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA   Pellegrini will certainly be startled by the way Jack Rodwell and Adam Johnson scored within three minutes of one another and the fact these are both former City players merely added to the feeling, following on from the 2-2 draw against Burnley, that the home side were in danger of suffering what used to be known here as the dreaded “Cityitis”. As it turned out, we were reminded that the modern-day side found the cure a long time ago but that was an alarming period for City as Rodwell headed in from a corner and Johnson scored a penalty after Pablo Zabaleta had scythed down Billy Jones. Sunderland had barely ventured into the opposition’s half until that period, with Johnson and Will Buckley dropping back as extra full-backs and Rodwell playing just in front of defence. This was not the first time City have encountered these kind of smothering tactics but the game dramatically changed after the 57th minute when Touré let fly, 25 yards out, to score a beauty, still rising as it soared into the top corner. Jovetic’s goal was clever in its own way, the forward playing the ball out to Gaël Clichy on the left and then continuing his run into the penalty area to meet the cross and flick the ball past Costel Pantilimon. At other times, City missed the attacking edge Sergio Agüero would usually provide. Touré was hugely influential, showing why he will be such a loss when he goes to the Africa Cup of Nations, with the prospect of missing matches against Chelsea and Arsenal. David Silva was also prominently involved, though not quite able to emulate his form of recent matches and perhaps showing a few signs of fatigue. City do, however, have a great habit of holding their nerve when the heat of the battle is suddenly turned up. They responded to Johnson’s equaliser as if affronted by Sunderland’s temerity and missed more chances than they will care to remember in the final quarter of an hour. Lampard fits in seamlessly and his precise header, from another of Clichy’s left-wing deliveries, was the compelling evidence why one City’s gain is another’s loss.

95,2015-01-01T17:11:45Z,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jan/01/virtues-of-vice-magazine-transformed-into-global-giant,The virtues of Vice: how punk magazine was transformed into media giant,media,Media,The Guardian,"In a break from making millions as the world’s richest ad man, Sir Martin Sorrell was asked how best to understand the new media landscape. Visit the headquarters of Vice Media, said the head of WPP. Later he said: “They understand how millennials think, what content millennials want.” The enthusiasm of 69-year-old Sorrell, whose company owns a 10% stake in Vice, is shared by many of his media mogul friends. That the Murdochs, via 21st Century Fox, Disney’s Bob Iger and the co-founder of MTV Tom Freston all provide cash-backed enthusiasm for Vice suggests they believe that the company, which started life as a “punk magazine” in Montreal in 1994, could understand young people better than News Corp, Disney or any other more traditional media company. But how? Vice, with its gonzo-style journalism and access-all-areas attitude (typical headline: I Went Undercover in America’s Toughest Prison), is not easy to define. Yet it has somehow come to define a new media age of shareable video content, mostly because of its success – real or perceived – among young people. For these so-called “millennials” – roughly born between 1980 and 2000 – offer a sort of fountain of youth for a media industry faced with ageing readers and viewers, and distribution models still being disrupted by the internet. Many of the 7.8 million British television viewers who tuned in to the Queen’s Christmas Day message may not have heard of Vice Media, but almost twice that number have viewed the 43-minute Vice documentary about Islamic State (Isis): its rare footage of leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and gory clips of severed body parts had a total of 15.5m views on YouTube when viewed as a whole and in parts. With 11 digital channels ranging from Vice News to Motherboard (“covering cultural happenings in technology”), Noisey (“a music discovery channel”), a food channel called Munchies, a TV studio and film division, and a record label, as well as the tie-ups with YouTube, HBO and China Daily, Vice has a more diverse business model compared with, say, Channel 4, which offers advertisers slots around specific content at specific times. And that’s before we even start discussing the work produced by the in-house creative services agency, Virtue, which provides advertorial content. Yet a very conspicuous buzz, so hard to quantify, attached itself to Vice in 2014 and it shows no sign of abating in 2015. Vice, which bills itself as “the coolest magazine in the world”, launched a UK edition in 2002 and now operates in 35 countries, becoming a multimedia company in the early part of the century, Late last year Vice took on James Schwab, a merger and acquisitions lawyer, and Shane Smith, the company’s ebullient founder, talked gleefully of spending a potential $500m snapping up “our competition”. Another senior hiring is Alyssa Mastromonaco, former deputy chief of staff to Barack Obama in the White House, who starts as chief operations officer this month. “Behind Vice is an eclectic cast of some of the sharpest and most creative minds in media, and I’m thrilled to be joining the ranks, albeit a little less young than most,” said the 38-year-old on her appointment. Two $250m investments in September led to a new corporate valuation of an estimated $2.5bn. In an interview with the FT in mid-December, Smith, the 45-year-old who launched the magazine with two friends, hyped up a potential stock market listing for the New York-based company this year by talking about potential revenues of $1bn and 30-35% margins, adding: “What media offering has there been like that in the last decade?” Smith said margins were likely to grow by 10%. “That’s a pretty sexy offering,” he bragged, without giving details of how those margins would be widened. “This is the birth of the next big media brand.” Vice’s journalism has plenty of critics. David Carr, the New York Times’s media critic, famously once damned it as “putting on a safari hat and looking at some poop”. It was behind the controversial meeting of basketball star Dennis Rodman and Kim Jong-un in North Korea, for instance, in 2013. Lately that criticism has become more muted as searing reports from Ukraine and Syria, among others, have won plaudits. Its news magazine show on HBO, Vice, won an Emmy last August. At the same time, criticism of how Vice does business has increased. A “guide to the backlash” on the Digiday website back in October listed doubts over the exact number of millennials who watched Vice content, a key metric, as well as the company’s relationship with corporate sponsors and its treatment of staff. A global company with a surprisingly efficient press department, Vice does not take kindly to criticism. When Nick Denton, founder of the blogging network Gawker Media, questioned Smith’s interest in lucrative sponsored content streams, the Vice founder told the Guardian: “Nick Denton has accused me of fucking Hiroshima.” So how exactly does this global business operating out of many time zones work? Go to see them, urged Sorrell. “The working conditions are different [from traditional media], the approach is different...They are more modern, much less bureaucratic and much more visceral.” It is true that the atmosphere in the Shoreditch headquarters of Vice in London owes more to the aesthetic of Silicon Valley than to more traditional TV companies. It is all grey concrete floors and folded-up table tennis tables, and several of the staff are wearing woolly beanie hats while sipping herbal tea at their desks when the Guardian visits. The average age of the still largely white staff working at Vice is just 27.    Al Brown. head of video content at Vice, left, and Kevin Sutcliffe, head of news, at the company’s London office. Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian   Kevin Sutcliffe, now in charge of commissioning and editing Vice News content in Europe as head of news programmes, is older than the average, and his appearance wearing a black T-shirt and bright trainers at the Guardian Edinburgh TV festival this summer earned him a ribbing from former colleagues at Channel 4 used to him in more staid clothes. Yet the difference between his old and new jobs is far more than sartorial, he insists. He described the working environment as “leaner and quicker … we’re not subject to particular bureaucratic pressures and the only demand on me is to make extremely good content”. (This is backed up by freelance journalists, who though they may criticise some of the treatment doled out by Vice say the time between pitching ideas and getting a decision is a quantum shorter than when pitching at the BBC for example.) Before Christmas, at an industry event to discuss the future of the BBC in London, Sutcliffe went further as he eyed the assembled sea of largely grey-haired men and said: “The only reason I’m here is because Vice speaks to young people.” Launched in March 2014, Vice News is one of the fastest growing news channels on YouTube with more than a million subscribers to date. It’s easy to see the growing appeal of online video, for advertisers at least. Three-quarters of adults watch an average of 115 hours of TV news a year compared with just 27 hours a year among 16- to 24-year-olds, according to the latest Ofcom research. The comparison – as is so often the case when trying to compare old “watch once” media with new “watched at different times on different platforms” – is not straightforward. Indeed, few of the numbers attached to Vice, a private company with a relatively complicated structure, are easy for established measurement agencies such as Comscore to quantify, including its claim to have a monthly global audience of 181 million people. This has led to excited interest from people looking to make money from the new new thing, and criticism from those distrustful of new measurement techniques. Vice’s audience figure of 181 million, across all platforms, conflicts with the industry standard measurement gathered by Comscore, which found in June 2014 that Vice.com’s website and its mobile apps reached 4.2 million internet users in the UK, more than doubling year-on-year but still well below many other news brands, including the Guardian. What’s more, these figures included fewer millennials than for much older brands such as the New York Times. A spokesman for Vice said Comscore was “inaccurate” as it only measured one of its sites, Vice.com, rather than all 10, which include Motherboard and Noisey. Dan Miller, the Vice UK spokesman, compared Comscore’s figures to judging the BBC’s audience by television alone and ignoring online and radio. On the plus side, a report for Ofcomby Enders Analysis found nearly two-thirds of Vice users (even in the smaller Comscore figures) were under 35, compared with just over a third for BBC News. Joe Evans, internet analyst at Enders, said Vice viewers were not just young but tended to be affluent and male, the “new mainstream” in ad-speak. They are also loyal. Al Brown, one of the longest-serving members of staff in London, who is now head of video content, said the launch of the Vice News channel was prompted by the public’s reaction to serious Vice content when its back catalogue was put on YouTube three years ago. “The content that outstripped everything else by a huge margin was our most serious hard-hitting documentaries like Vice goes to Liberia. Everyone told us to make bitesized funny clips but we were putting 20-50-minute serious documentaries and they were by far the most popular thing we put up. There was a very well-connected global young hungry audience which wanted to experience big complex global stories in a way that was accessible and no one else was doing it.” Asked what was different about Vice footage, he said: “It’s made by young people for young people. If our journalists are scared, that makes it into the film. What our journalists are feeling is a huge part of our vernacular.” Sutcliffe sees this as an essential difference between his films and those of more mainstream media. “The BBC say people turn to it in a crisis for the truth. But people turn to lots and lots of different sources now that the world is a very uncomfortable place … I personally go and find it in 20 different places and make my own mind up. Broadcasters say people trust us but that’s not true. Trust is not the battleground, authenticity is the battleground.” Such authenticity is potentially harmed by controversies over the relatively close relationship between Vice and Virtue, the company’s agency arm. Last year Capital New York reported allegations from former employee Charles Davis that commercial concerns had killed reports. Enders said the Vice business model – producing “alternative” content without the huge overheads of the older media companies and using the global, cheap distribution network of the web – had created “enviable financial success”. Yet it raises concerns about the very modern blurring of the distinction between editorial and advertorial content before noting that “traditional media regularly navigates similar hazards”. Brown has no problem with this, as long as it’s “clearly labelled”. “The best place for us is to make content we want to make and find someone to sponsor it. That’s not going to be an Isis film but if it’s Vice Sports or Munchies, it’s about creating channels or opportunities.” Besides, his audience are too sophisticated to be taken in for long, Brown insisted. “Young people are real bullshit detectors.”",profile/janemartinson,Jane,Martinson
96,2015-01-01T17:13:36Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/01/newcastle-burnley-premier-league-match-report,Burnley’s George Boyd thwarts Newcastle with late goal to grab point,football,Football,The Guardian,"John Carver’s audition for Alan Pardew’s old job concluded with a smattering of boos and two dropped points. The jeers were a little harsh on a day that could hardly have provided more entertainment – albeit some of it was of the slapstick variety – but the caretaker’s increasingly anxious expression betrayed the reality that this was far from a vintage Newcastle United performance. With Danny Ings, Ashley Barnes and George Boyd impressing, Burnley, surely a decent bet to avoid relegation, fully merited the draw and probably more at the end of a day in which they hit the woodwork four times. If alarmingly slapdash displays from Fabricio Coloccini and Cheik Tioté threatened to cost Newcastle – and Carver – dear, Sean Dyche’s wonderfully attack-minded side deserve every plaudit going for equalising three times after losing a trio of players to illness and injury in the first half. “I’ve never been involved in a match where the cliche about a game of two halves was so apparent,” said Carver. “We were so good in the first half but so poor in the second. I’m so disappointed. We got a point we didn’t deserve.” His gloom was exacerbated by Steven Taylor having almost certainly ruptured an achilles tendon. “It’s not looking good,” said Pardew’s former assistant, who expects the centre-half to be sidelined until next season. The loss of one of football’s good guys leaves Newcastle at least one defender short but Carver’s immediate concerns were purely human. “I’ve known Steven since he was in the centre of excellence and he’s a great lad,” he said. Ironically, the afternoon began deceptively well for Taylor as, within minutes, he rose above Jason Shackell to head Jack Colback’s corner past Tom Heaton. Carver’s joy turned to horror as Burnley launched a long punt upfield that Paul Dummett inexplicably succeeded in heading beyond Jak Alnwick after Taylor’s initial intervention had directed it back towards Newcastle’s goalkeeper. Dyche limbered up for the trip to Tyneside by taking his family to watch Cinderella and, as that equaliser from the home left-back flew in, Burnley’s manager must have felt he was back at the pantomime. Up in the stands the joke that Dummett must be the only Geordie who doesn’t know where Alnwick is – for those unfamiliar with the north-east, it’s a town in Northumberland – quickly did the rounds. An earlier, similarly comedic, moment, resulted in Tioté, increasingly unreliable these days, carelessly conceding possession in the face of Ings. It preceded a pass to Barnes that resulted in the striker unleashing a curling shot that rebounded back off the inside of a post. After that it was all Newcastle for a while, with Colback compensating for Dummett’s own goal by meeting Daryl Janmaat’s pass and defying Heaton courtesy of a crisp, long-range shot. The sense that it was not destined to be Dyche’s day seemed compounded by Burnley’s appalling luck. By the 36th minute the visitors had used up their full complement of substitutes, with Shackell hobbling off, Dean Marney succumbing to a violent vomiting bug and Kevin Long, who had replaced Shackell, being taken off on a stretcher with a potentially nasty ankle injury. Theories that fate was working against the visitors heightened further when Ings’s stellar, subtly swerving, shot bounced back off the underside of the bar before Barnes’s header from the rebound struck a post. Dyche’s almost disbelieving grimace suggested he had just been subjected to a particular barbaric form of torture. It got worse. When Coloccini, by now wobbly, erred, Ben Mee directed a close-range header against the bar. Dyche was reduced to sardonic shrugging but his smile returned when Ings – showing off the touch and movement that had made Pardew so keen to sign him – connected with Mee’s cross to finally register a richly deserved headed equaliser. With Newcastle’s first-half superiority a rapidly receding memory, there had been a feeling of growing inevitability about a goal that arrived shortly after Alnwick performed wonders to tip Boyd’s 35-yard shot over the bar. Although Moussa Sissoko polished off a rare home counterattack by lashing Ayoze Pérez’s classy cross out of Heaton’s reach there certainly remained no cause for Geordie complacency. Sure enough, when Boyd met Ings’ pass he surged, imperiously, through the home defence before beating Alnwick with a low shot. Instantaneously, Carver’s new year was ruined.

97,2015-01-01T17:17:16Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/01/liverpool-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report,Leicester battle from two goals behind to earn draw at Liverpool,football,Football,The Guardian,"Character is essential in a relegation battle and Leicester City displayed it in abundance at Anfield. More importantly, it was their quality that stalled Liverpool’s momentum as Nigel Pearson and company went from raging at the referee, Mike Jones, at half-time to applauding a stirring fightback at the close. “We got what we deserved,” lamented Brendan Rodgers. The Leicester manager reiterated his call for video technology after his bottom-of-the-table side conceded two penalties, one for a ball striking their captain, Wes Morgan, in the face. Their complaints were legitimate but should not overshadow the impressive performance that earned a deserved point against a sluggish, careless Liverpool side. A comfortable two-goal lead at half-time owed little to Liverpool’s display and almost everything to the match official but that luxury was squandered as easily as the ball on a trying afternoon for Rodgers. “We weren’t bright enough on the ball,” the Liverpool manager said. “We didn’t keep the ball for long enough and the rhythm of our passing was slower than normal. We were fortunate enough to get a penalty and then we found ourselves 2-0 up. That should be enough to play the game out but we made too many mistakes.” Steven Gerrard scored the two penalties – the first a joke, the second justified – as Leicester players railed at Jones and their coaching staff gathered at the top of the tunnel to berate the referee at half-time. Pearson made his displeasure known before heading to the dressing room after a word with a police officer. “I spoke to him,” clarified the Leicester manager, who was fined £10,000 and given a one-match touchline ban over his recent spat with a fan. “He was there to manage the area. I spoke to him before the game, too. I haven’t been arrested.”    Jeffrey Schlupp equalises for Leicester City in the Premier League game against Liverpool. Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images   Leicester were the more enterprising side and should have been ahead before Jones pointed to the spot for the first time. The impressive Riyad Mahrez, who scored the winner at Hull City that ended a run of six straight Premier League defeats for Pearson’s side, hit the woodwork after 66 seconds with a free-kick that deceived Simon Mignolet at his near post. Mahrez then squandered a glorious chance from Jeffrey Schlupp’s cross. The two wide men were a thorn in Liverpool’s side and will be sorely missed when they depart for the Africa Cup of Nations. Liverpool’s energy and intensity dropped from the highs of Monday against Swansea City but they were gifted a penalty when Raheem Sterling’s cross from the byline hit the diving Morgan in the face before connecting with his arm. The referee, who has the ‘beach ball’ goal against Liverpool among his litany of errors, decided otherwise and Gerrard, back in the starting lineup having been rested against Swansea, converted the penalty to the left of the goalkeeper Ben Hamer. “I’m not going to be ultra-critical but we could see what happened within seconds,” said Pearson. “We could make the officials’ job much easier if we utilised the technology that is available but we don’t and so this will keep happening.” Heads could easily have dropped, given Leicester’s position, but they continued to press, only to be undone by a second Liverpool penalty. This one was legitimate. Three blue shirts backed off Philippe Coutinho as he weaved down the left and his flick into the area struck Danny Simpson’s raised hand. Jones called it right, Hamer dived the same way from the spot-kick but Gerrard went the other. Pearson said: “It hits his hand but it was unintentional. There is no consistency.” David Nugent replaced the injured Danny Drinkwater in the Leicester attack and should have pulled a goal back early in the second half with a free header from Matty James’ corner. That effort was glanced wide but the boyhood Evertonian made no mistake with a superb finish seconds later. A flowing passing move was rounded off in fitting fashion when James lofted a ball into the area, the tireless Jamie Vardy chested down to Nugent and the striker hitch-kicked a half volley into the far corner. Leicester were deservedly level two minutes later, courtesy of another fine goal, this time from Schlupp, who was given too much space on the edge of the area and drilled a low finish inside Mignolet’s left-hand post.

98,2015-01-01T17:18:12Z,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/01/crowdfunding-timbuktu-manuscripts-african-culture,Crowdfunding saved Timbuktu’s manuscripts. What’s next?,technology,Technology,The Guardian,"Thomas Gruner didn’t know Timbuktu was a real town when it was drawn to his attention by the hacker community. They had seen a campaign on the crowdfunding site Indiegogo called T160K to raise money to protect several hundred thousand historic manuscripts that had been evacuated from the al-Qaida-occupied north of Mali but were now at risk of rotting in the humid climate of the capital, Bamako. Gruner, a young programmer from Olympia, Washington state, wanted to do his bit to help. So, naturally, he wrote a game. If visitors to the T160K web page played it, they could hold umbrellas over photographs of the rescued texts, many of which date to the time of the European middle ages. It was trivial but diverting. “I thought if I could make something that was fun, people would start sharing it, and we could get T160K more active on social media,” says the unabashedly geeky Gruner now, sitting in the shared office space in Seattle where he sometimes works. The game – and the Indiegogo campaign – delivered: tens of thousands of dollars given by more than 1,000 donors bought dehumidifying agents to save Mali’s manuscripts anew. It was an innovative use of a very modern phenomenon, crowdfunding via the internet, to protect something very old. Now the woman behind T160K is relaunching it with a bigger team and expanded remit: to find money for other cultural projects in Africa. Stephanie Diakité, a 56-year-old cultural development specialist who helped her friend, the Timbuktu librarian Abdel Kader Haidara, evacuate the manuscripts, wants to revolutionise the funding of culture in Africa by connecting communities, often in different parts of the world. “It was amazing how many hackers got interested in the Timbuktu manuscripts,” says Diakité. “They were fascinated by it. There was one – her handle was hackerbabe – who said something like, ‘Hey, guys, these people are like doing sthg with real words, so let’s help em!’ Then we got this huge whoosh of contributions.” Commercial operations such as Indiegogo and Kickstarter have been around for at least five years – but a growing number of organisations are experimenting with crowdsourcing as a philanthropic tool. The San Francisco-based not-for-profit website Watsi finds donors who help fund healthcare around the world, the principal criterion being that the medical intervention will be life-changing. Community Sourced Capital, also based in Seattle, is attempting to solve the problem of banks’ unwillingness to lend money to entrepreneurs by crowdsourcing small business loans. “It’s an amazing model,” says Tony Dowler, T160K’s CEO. The first wave of T160K projects include raising money for Ethiopia’s first professional circus, Debre Berhan, a bid to save the endangered Fendika music club in Addis Ababa, and financing for Instruments4Africa films documenting Africa’s disappearing musical traditions. There is also a bid to raise $100,000 to catalogue the Timbuktu manuscripts, which are now in exile. The team hopes to build a community of interested donors around each project, who will inform each other and T160K of any progress. “When we launched the Indiegogo campaign, not much happened at first,” says Dowler. “We had to build that community. We have to build communities round those other projects. Building a community of people know something about dance in Ethiopia, who will participate not just as funders, but people who will spread the word and tell us things about them.” The main tool is social media. “We spent some money on a PR campaign when we did the Indiegogo campaign,” says Dowler. “But the value of the hour a day we spent on social media outstripped that so drastically that we just learned our lesson that social media is the way to go.” It is a chance to rewrite the sluggish, top-down approach to grant-giving: instead of jumping through major donors’ hoops, T160K seeks to provide quick, grassroots support. “We are not competing against the large institutions in terms of culture and development,” says Diakité. “That system is not going to go away till the X and Z generation become the principal consumers in all our economies. But the whole paradigm is changing. These large cultural institutions are funded by profit-based institutions and so they operate like that. They operate in controlling ways – I’m the funder and these are our criteria and this is how we work – but we don’t want to operate that way.” If the new iteration of T160K is a success, the team plans to roll it out beyond Africa. “If it works, five years from now, Unesco will launch a crowdfunding site, the Gates Foundation will launch a crowdfunding site,” says Dowler. “You heard me predict this!”",profile/charlie-english,english,charlie

In a campaign due to launch in February, dentists will be urged to check that the drills, x-ray machines and other equipment they buy for their surgeries come from trusted suppliers. The industry has teamed up with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to raise awareness of the problem after the seizure of more than 12,000 poor-quality dental products in 2014. Most of the counterfeit products came from China and Pakistan and were sold through online marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay and Alibaba. Enforcement officials found that online the counterfeit equipment sold for a fraction of the price of legitimate items. “Dental devices from China have been one of the most prolific areas we’ve been dealing with,” said Alastair Jeffrey, head of enforcement at the MHRA. “We’ve had dental drills come apart in a patient’s mouth and x-ray machines that produce a much higher level of radiation than they should.” In their last crackdown, the MHRA seized 3,242 poor-quality root canal files that could break in a patient’s mouth, 384 dental drills and 24 dental x-ray machines that produced too much radiation. “We are seeing an increase in counterfeit dental equipment. Devices are going to be a growth area for us,” Jeffrey added. Edmund Proffitt at the British Dental Industry Association (BDIA) said the campaign would run in the specialised dental magazines from February, though other awareness activities were planned too. Many of the fake dental devices reported or recovered in raids looked like high-quality products but were made from inferior materials and to poor standards. “They are becoming sophisticated. They are getting modern, up-to-date equipment and re-manufacturing it to a much lower quality. They are copying the CE markings, the instructions, the logos and even the packaging,” Proffitt said. “Our campaign is all about being vigilant. There are fakes out there and the key message is buy from a reputable supplier,” he added. Among other items the MHRA seized in 2014 were 683 lights for curing composite fillings, 14 air syringes and 37 dental air turbines. Proffitt said that while the industry wanted to raise awareness of the problem, the danger to patients was low. “The last thing we want to do is be alarmist. We are tackling these cheeky monkeys,” he said. The MHRA is working with the BDIA, Amazon, eBay and other sites to clamp down on imports to the UK. But Jeffrey said dentists had a responsibility to ensure that their equipment was safe and warned them not to fall for cheap deals on the internet. “It’s a price issue,” he said. “The cost is so below the market value it’s clear the equipment is not what it should be.” Amazon said that all sellers on its marketplace must adhere to strict guidelines. “Any seller found to contravene those guidelines will be subject to action from Amazon including removal of product listings and their account,” a spokesperson said. A spokesperson for eBay said its sellers must also comply with the law and the site’s own policies, adding: “eBay has made significant investment in technology, people and systems to improve both our own investigations and our responsiveness to concerns raised by regulators in line with our commitment to ensuring we are the most trusted way to shop,” the spokesperson said. “But it’s important to note that earning shoppers’ trust is a job bigger than any one entity. It’s a shared responsibility among all parties that use online systems, from businesses through to regulators and law enforcement, all of whom must work together to keep online commerce safe and secure.”",profile/iansample,sample,
100,2015-01-01T17:30:01Z,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/01/music-awards-for-new-artists-blessing-or-curse,The new noise bubble: are critics' choice awards for new artists a blessing or a curse?,music,Music,The Guardian,"It wouldn’t be a bad idea to place a bet on James Bay selling a few albums in 2015. The lachrymose Hertfordshire singer-songwriter won this year’s Brits Critics’ Choice award, and is tipped to win the BBC Sound of 2015 poll next Friday. He also figured in several other ones-to-watch lists at the end of last year, including the influential MTV Brand New and the Red Bull Launched List. While it’s no guarantee of success, it would be surprising if Bay’s fledgling career didn’t receive a substantial uplift, much as last year’s Critics’ Choice/Sound of 2014 winner, Sam Smith, did. And that’s because these awards have ceased to be a sampling of the musical trends; instead they’ve become the crucial first step in marketing a new artist, to such an extent that getting on the tips lists has almost become an end in itself. Breaking a new artist has always involved both calculation and luck. Record companies can’t predict which new acts will strike a chord with the public, but they can try to secure the widest possible exposure, and these days nothing equals the burst of attention that comes with being nominated in (or, better yet, winning) one of the key polls. The annual next-big-thing lists are now such a stepping-stone that a nomination is a major aim of many artist-development campaigns. A nod from Sound of, Critics’ Choice or even the indie-leaning UK Blog Sound can be worth more than months of touring and thousands of Facebook “likes” – it’s even claimed that by industry insiders labels will concentrate their investment on those artists they believe have a chance of getting on to the big lists. “It’s very important for a new act to get into year-end polls, because it gives somebody a head start,” says an industry insider, who wants to remain anonymous. “All of a sudden people are looking at you and listening to the music and your picture is everywhere, and the media is picking up on it, and it becomes a self-fulfilling thing.” That is exactly what’s happening to Bay (who declined to be interviewed for this article): he’s been releasing tracks and gigging tirelessly for 18 months – supporting John Newman and Tom Odell on tour, and even playing on the catwalk at a Burberry fashion show. Yet it wasn’t until the Critics’ Choice win that the public really took notice, because it’s one of the only ways for a new act to push through what Brits chairman and Warner Music CEO Max Lousada calls “the noise bubble”.    “There are so many routes and platforms now, but there are fewer and fewer windows to get your artist widespread exposure,” he says. “At least this allows a slightly clearer conversation between artist and fan.” “Noise bubble” is certainly the word for it – the enthusiasts who predicted that the internet would democratise music clearly didn’t foresee a future of plodding through dozens of homemade YouTube versions of Call Me Maybe in search of things worth hearing. Sound of (launched in 2003), Critics’ Choice (2008) and the others sift through the endless churn of new faces and, with luck, pick some of the best. While Critics’ Choice invariably tips major-label acts – Bay and this year’s runners-up, George the Poet Years & Years, are all signed to the Universal Records conglomerate – Sound of … goes for both mainstream and leftfield; one of this year’s shortlisted artists, Croydon MC Stormzy, is still unsigned. Both lists, though, are much scrutinised by the media, resulting in the kind of publicity money can’t buy. George the Poet, aka 23-year-old Londoner George Mpanga, who is on both lists, is delighted that his politically charged songs are connecting: “If it makes people aware of me, it’s got to be good. I don’t feel burdened with expectation. It is what it is.” Record companies start planning their campaigns months in advance, after deciding which of their new signings has the best chance of featuring on one of the lists. “If you have one mad experimental act and one pop act, the one you’re going to push for is the pop act,” explains the industry source. “You keep it quite focused. Suppose you want Artist X to win Critics’ Choice – you put your resources into that, you go in hard. You can find out who’s voting and try to target them.” (“Targeted” voters will receive MP3s and showcase invitations, rather than the mythical briefcaseful of cash – I vote in both the Critics’ Choice and Sound of … and have never been offered anything more illicit than an advance copy of a CD.) But before a label will plough its energies into a campaign, the act needs to have started to connect with the public. A track will be released online, say, and if it gets mentioned on the influential blog aggregator Hype Machine, or appears in the Shazam chart, which counts the number of times a song is “recognised” by the music identification app, it starts to gain traction. That’s how Bay did it. His early tracks received spot plays on Radio 1, which in turn pushed them to the top of the Hype Machine chart. “If that keeps happening,” says the source, “it’s a fair bet this is something punters are getting into. So if you see you have a shot with a new act, you start spending your money on them.”    Little Boots … still to make the predicted breakthrough. Photograph: Tom Oxley   As the next-big-thing lists assume more importance, more are being launched across other genres, including country and Christian music, in an attempt to become talking points and generate website traffic. But the polls are contentious: many people resent being told what they should be listening to, and complain that the results are skewed in favour of major-label acts (even the impeccably alternative Blog Sound poll tips several Universal Records artists). Some also question the impartiality of those who vote in them, suspecting that the “industry experts and tastemakers” on the Critics’ Choice and Sound of panels are in league with the music industry. The very term “critics’ choice” implies a we-know-best elitism. For the nominees themselves, it can have a negative effect if they don’t quickly capitalise on it. Every Critics’ Choice winner, from Adele to Sam Smith, has been outstandingly successful – but then, they had major labels behind them, ensuring that advertising was booked, tour dates in place and music ready for release. But many nominees, and even some winners of other polls, are wrongfooted by the sudden attention. “Once the egg timer is on,” as Record of the Day publisher Paul Scaife puts it, “there’s a level of expectation, which has helped some people, but others seem to be tarred with the brush of failure.” Jacob Rickard, producer of BBC Sound of 2015, maintains a nomination is an opportunity for an artist “to make out of it what they will”, but concedes that early exposure can be detrimental. “I guess it can also be counterproductive if you don’t do well. There are one or two every year that don’t take off as much as the others.” Prematurely raised expectations didn’t help dance-pop singer Little Boots, who won Sound of 2009 but achieved relatively modest success, certainly compared with other winners of the title. “People see me as this example of someone who was No 1 on this poll and didn’t have worldwide No 1 records, and people are very quick to focus on that. Unless you go stratospheric, people are very quick to judge. But I’ve just made my third album and I have a career from [winning], so it’s not like things didn’t happen. But I guess I didn’t turn into the UK Lady Gaga, which is what I was marketed as.” Her opinion of ones-to-watch lists now? “I know managers who try to not to get their artists onto them ’cos the expectations are too high. It clouds your personality and vision when you win and you have to be strong to get through. Even if I do the most creative, coolest thing, I come with this story that’s very difficult to shake.” Critics Choice and Sound Of … the winners BBC Sound Of … 2003 – 50 Cent 2004 – Keane 2005 – The Bravery 2006 – Corinne Bailey Rae 2007 – Mika 2008 – Adele 2009 – Little Boots 2010 - Ellie Goulding 2011 – Jessie J 2012 – Michael Kiwanuka 2013 – Haim 2014 – Sam Smith Brits Critics’ Choice 2008 - Adele 2009 – Florence & the Machine 2010 – Ellie Goulding 2011 – Jessie J 2012 – Emeli Sandé 2013 – Tom Odell 2014 – Sam Smith 2015 – James Bay   ",profile/carolinesullivan,,Sullivan

In 21 states and the District of Columbia, the new year brings with it a pay raise for those earning a minimum wage.  In his State of the Union address last year, Barack Obama called on Congress to raise the federal minimum wage, which has been at $7.25 since July 2009, to $10.10. The following day, the president echoed that sentiment while speaking at Costco: “Right now in Congress, there’s a bill that would lift the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour – $10.10 – $10.10, it’s easy.”   Tired of waiting for Congress to move on the issue of minimum wage, a number of US states have taken matters into their own hands.  Alaska Alaskans should see their minimum wage increased in 2015, but they have to wait for the election results of the 4 November ballot initiative to be certified. The first pay increase to $8.75 an hour from $7.75 will take place 90 days from the certification, which be probably at the end of February, says Ed Flanagan, chair of Alaskans for a Fair Minimum Wage.    Zoe Buck checks out an empty voting booth as her mother votes at the Alaska Zoo polling place in Anchorage. Photograph: Ted S Warren/AP   Arizona Arizona passed the Raise the Minimum Wage for Working Arizonians act in 2006. The law gives the Industrial Commission of Arizona the authority to raise the minimum wage based on the cost of living measured by the consumer price index of all urban consumers (CPI-U). The 1.7% rise in the index between in the one year before August 2014 was applied to the state’s existing minimum wage of $7.90 per hour. The new rate is $8.05 per hour. Arkansas Arkansas is one of the US states where minimum wage was lower than the federally mandated $7.25. That is, until 1 January. Thanks to a minimum wage ballot initiative, Arkansas low-wage workers will see their pay go up to $7.50 from $6.25 The minimum wage is then set to increase again in 2016 to $8 and in 2017 to $8.50.  Colorado Colorado’s minimum wage saw an automatic hike on Thursday to $8.23 and $5.21 per hour for tipped employees. The adjustment is dictated by Article XVIII, Section 15, of the Colorado Constitution, which requires the Colorado minimum wage to be adjusted annually for inflation, on the lines of the Consumer Price Index for Colorado. The new rates replace 2014’s general rate of $8.00 and $4.98 for tipped employees.  Connecticut At $8.70 an hour, Connecticut’s minimum wage was already higher than the federal minimum wage of $7.25. The state, however, passed a law to gradually increase it to $10.10 in the next three years. Connecticut was the first state to gradually raise its minimum wage to $10.10. On Thursday the state’s minimum wage increased  to $9.15.  Florida Florida’s minimum wage will rise to $8.05 on Friday, up from $7.93, following a 2004 amendment to labor laws that will adjust the minimum wage to match inflation. This increase will benefit an estimated 416,000 low-wage workers according to the Economic Policy Institute.    Obama plays golf at the Clipper Golf course on Marine Corps Base Hawaii during his Christmas holiday vacation in Kaneohe. Photograph: Hugh Gentry/Reuters   Hawaii Hawaii, where President Obama celebrated the New Year, is also one of the states leading the way on higher minimum wage. While this year its minimum wage is only going up 50 cents to $7.75, in the next two years it will go up 75 cents each year reaching $9.25 by 2017. In 2018, it will jump to $10.10. Along with Connecticut, Hawaii was one of the first states to gradually increase its minimum wage to $10.10. Maryland Connecticut might have been the first, but it was not that only state to work toward $10.10. In May, Maryland’s governor Martin O’Malley signed a legislation that increases the state’s minimum wage to $10.10 by 2018. On 1 January it increased to $8 from $7.25. It will then go up another quarter in July – reaching $8.25.  Massachusetts Low-wage workers in Massachusetts will see their pay go up to $9 a hour. That’s a $1 boost. That’s not all. Forget $10.10. Thanks to a bill approved by the state’s legislature and signed into a law by Governor Deval Patrick, the state will have a minimum wage of $11 an hour come January 2017. Missouri A July reading of the Midwest Consumer Price will take Missouri’s minimum wage up to $7.65 from $7.50. All businesses are required to pay at minimum the $7.65 per hour rate, except retail and service businesses whose annual gross sales are less than $500,000, according to a release from the Missouri Department of Labor and Industrial Relations.  Montana Montana Department of Labor and Industry has announced that the state’s minimum wage will increase from $7.90 to $8.05 in accordance with the Montana Code Annotated 39-3-409. The consumer price index has been used as a reference to measure the increase in cost of living to calculate the hike in wages. “An estimated 12,850 Montana workers, or 2.9% of the workforce, received hourly wages less than $8.05 per hour in 2014,” according to a department news release. Nebraska The federally mandated minimum wage of $7.25 is not enough for the low-wage workers of Nebraska, says Jeremy Nordquist, a state senator from Omaha, Nebraska. To help them make ends meet, Nordquist started a campaign to raise the state’s minimum wage and on 4 November, Nebraska’s voters joined him in asking for a raise. As a result, the state’s minimum wage in 2015 will go up to $8. Then in 2016, it will go up to $9 an hour.  New Jersey New Jersey too will automatically raise its minimum wage this year. Article 1, Paragraph 23, of the New Jersey Constitution, and N.J.A.C. 12:56-3.1(b) raises the minimum wage from $8.25 to $8.38, according to a memo from New Jersey’s Department of Labor and Workforce Development.  New York New Yorkers, who were already being paid a minimum wage of $8 an hour, will also see a bump in their paycheck. Their new rate? $8.75. The pay hike was effective 31 December. A law passed in 2013 by the state’s legislature guarantees that next New Year’s Eve they’ll get another raise, worth all of 25 cents.  Ohio In the new year, Ohio’s minimum wage will rise to $8.10 for non-tipped employees while those workers who receive at least $30 a month in tips will need to be compensated at $4.05 per hour, plus tips. The Ohio Department of Commerce has issued this directive following a 2006 amendment to the constitution, which according to Policy Matters Ohio, will affect one in 20 workers in the state.  Oregon Effective 1 January, Oregon employers will pay 15 cents more in hourly wages as the state has raised the minimum wage to $9.25. As in several other states, this change too is aligned with changes in the consumer price index. The hike will impact about 145,000 workers in the state, or roughly 8% of its total workforce, according to the Oregon Department of Labor and Industries. Rhode Island Just like their counterparts in Massachusetts, Rhode Island residents’ minimum wage increased to $9 an hour from $8 an hour. This is the largest of three consecutive wage hikes approved by the state’s assembly. In 2013, Rhode Island’s minimum wage went up 35 cents and this year it went up 25 cents. The only downside? If you are a full-time student younger than 19, you only have to be paid 90% of the state’s minimum wage: $8.10 an hour. Those 14 and 15 years old get even smaller wage - 75% of the state’s minimum wage. At $6.75, that’s 50 cents less than the federal minimum wage.    Obama speaks about the economy after a roundtable discussion at Rhode Island College in Providence, Rhode Island. Photograph: Stephan Savoia/AP    South Dakota Despite the business community’s opposition to the South Dakota’s minimum-wage ballot initiative, the state’s hourly minimum wage increases to $8.50. In the years after, the minimum wage will be adjusted if there is an increase in the cost of living. “In no case may the minimum wage be decreased,” insists the South Dakota Department of Labor. Vermont At $8.73 an hour, Vermont, too, is among the ranks of states that already have a wage that is higher than the federal minimum wage. The gap between the two wages got even bigger Thursday as Vermont’s minimum wage went up to $9.15 an hour. Planning for the years to come, in June Governor Peter Shumlin signed a law that gradually increases the state’s minimum wage to $10.50 an hour by 2018. In the years after 2018, the state’s minimum wage will be adjusted based on the increases in the cost of living.  Washington On 1 January, Washington’s minimum wage increased  to $9.47 per hour. According to the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries, workers who are 14 or 15 years old may be paid 85% of the adult minimum wage, or $8.05 per hour. The change matches a 1.59% increase in the federal Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers over the 12 months leading to 31 August. This change is estimated to impact 67,000 workers and totals to an approximate increase of $312 in wages over a year, per employee. West Virginia West Virginia’s minimum wage hike would have passed unanimously through both its state House and Senate had it not been for one State Senator - Republican senator Clark Barnes. Despite his nay vote, the state’s minimum wage went up New Year’s Day to $8 an hour. In 2016, it will go up again to $8.75.  Washington DC The District of Columbia’s minimum wage will rise to $10.50 on 1 July 2015. This is the second of three raises as part of the capital’s staggered increase from the 2013 minimum wage of $8.50. On 1 July 2016, the minimum wage will be raised further to $11.50 an hour. The three-step increase was initiated after mayor Vincent C Gray signed the Minimum Wage Amendment Act of 2013 into law on 15 January 2014.",profile/jana-kasperkevic,kasperkevic,jana

He was not recruited from rugby league and he did not have international renown. But as the Six Nations looms, his national coach faces a dilemma over whether to include him in the squad for the tournament. Anscombe, whose mother was born in Swansea, took some persuading to leave New Zealand, and Warren Gatland’s pressing need for a fly-half a year ago has been mitigated by the authority shown by Dan Biggar in the autumn. But a typically combative, penalty-loaded Welsh derby was adorned by some of the Cardiff Blues’ new recruit’s touches. Anscombe’s long pass to his centre Corey Allen on 15 minutes led to the only try of a game which tended to be played in between the 22s. The fly-half, who joined Cardiff Blues in November, is a link player rather than a destroyer of defences but he tends to see what is on earlier than his new colleagues. The derby was not an advert for the Pro12 but a reflection of the mediocrity of Welsh regional rugby where financial constraints have led to a glut of journeymen. The first half was a mess of collapsed scrums, aimless kicking, misdirected passing and handling errors, lightened only by a few moments of inspiration from Anscombe. “Gareth can spark a backline, whether running or passing, and he controlled the game well,” said the Blues’ director of rugby, Mark Hammett. “It was only his fourth match and he is still learning about his team-mates, the calibre we have and how he can direct things. He would add certain things to Wales, but that is Warren’s call to wrestle with.” The Blues had lost to the Dragons at the Arms Park on Boxing Day and conceding the double would have dropped them below their rivals in the league to become the lowest placed of the four regions. Anscombe missed a penalty and a conversion, but his smartly taken drop goal in the first half contrasted with the Dragons ignoring two glaring opportunities to collect three points in what always threatened to be a low-scoring match. “I am starting to find my feet here,” said the 23-year-old Anscombe. “It is a bit colder at training than I am used to, but I am enjoying it. I have no idea what will happen with Wales: they have two good outside-halves and competition is good for Welsh rugby. I just have to keep working hard and see where I end up.” He ended up on the winning side having been involved in his side’s three scores, but the Blues should not have been hanging on in the final minutes, grateful that a penalty decision at a scrum five metres from their line had gone their way having been blown at the set-piece nine times previously. They are the most indisciplined side in the Pro12 and reached their average of 13 penalties conceded on the hour. They were so uncomfortable up front in the opening half that they replaced their tighthead prop Taufa’ao Filise at half-time but his replacement, Adam Jones, was quickly pulling at his long hair in frustration. “They should have had a yellow card for what was happening at the scrum,” said the Dragons’ director of rugby, Lyn Jones. “Sam Warburton would have been in the sin-bin if he had been penalised at four rucks.” Lyn Jones’s frustration as his side’s four-match winning run ended was understandable, but the Dragons did not do enough with the ball in hand to merit victory. The wing Matthew Pewtner, who was at fault in the Blues’ try for rushing out of the defensive line, had a try disallowed in the second half because of blocking by his captain, Rynard Landman, but the Blues were one pass from at least three more tries, Gavin Evans, Richard Smith and Tavis Knoyle going for the line and ignoring unmarked players outside them. The Dragons twice led but for the most part had to chase the game and they were ill-equipped to do so. “It was a proper derby,” said Warburton, who missed the Boxing Day defeat. “I prefer these matches to Europe: the atmosphere makes them great to play in. We were determined not to concede the double and that meant stepping it up, which we did. Gareth made a difference. He has fitted in well and we have to build on this.” Newport Gwent Dragons Prydie; Pewtner, Morgan, Dixon, Amos; Tovey (Jones, 65), Rees (Evans, 48); Price, Dee, Harris (Way, 68), Coombs (Hill, 68), Landman (capt), Thomas, Cudd, Faletau.

Entitled Only One, the single channels the rapper’s late mother, Donda West, as she speaks from beyond the grave. Over jazzy chords and a tender organ solo from McCartney, Donda West movingly tells her son to “tell Nori about me”, referring to West’s daughter North. The song is is dedicated to the rapper’s daughter, North West, who was born in 2013. The 37-year-old released his last album, critically acclaimed Yeezus, in 2013, and received two Grammy nominations. A statement from McCartney on his official website said: “For any of you guys who were wondering what I was doing with Kanye … Here it is: Only One. “Happy rocking new year!” McCartney has a long history of collaborations with other artists, singing duets with Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, Tony Bennett, Lulu and George Michael. His last album was Ocean’s Kingdom, a collection of classical movements commissioned by the New York City Ballet. West spent much of 2014 recording his new LP, which he has postponed despite previously saying it would be ready in autumn 2014. In May he married Kim Kardashian, famously spending days tinkering with their official wedding photo on Instagram.

The winner of the 2012 Champion Hurdle never looked entirely happy when sent over fences after he lost the speed to keep up with the best over timber at the minimum trip, but has been much happier switched back to the smaller obstacles of late and was in his element in Thursday’s Grade Two Dornan Hurdle at a track where he has such a good record. After seeing his ten-year-old battle up the familiar Cheltenham hill under Noel Fehily to see off Vaniteux by over two lengths, trainer Harry Fry said he was of a mind to send Rock On Ruby straight to the Festival meeting where he will step his runner up four furlongs to three miles for the World Hurdle. “The reception he got says it all. He’s turned 10 yet is still showing the young horses how it’s done,” said a delighted Fry. “He’s got such a good record here it would almost be a sin not to come in March and the one race for him is the World Hurdle which means stepping him up in trip, but he’ll get the entry. We won’t know if he stays until we try,” he added. Nicky Henderson was of the opinion that Vaniteux didn’t travel with his usual fluency and said he would wait for better ground for the runner-up after his charge failed to justify favouritism. The trainer, whose horses have been slow to reach peak form this season, was at a loss to explain the poor performance of the highly promising Beat That, who was as low as 6-1 in the betting for the World Hurdle before this race but finished well beaten in sixth on his comeback. Beat That was pushed out to a best-priced 12-1 for the Cheltenham contest with Rock On Ruby freely available at 14-1 for the same race. More Of That remains the 7-2 favourite. The most impressive winner of the day was Ptit Zig, who completed a four-timer in the Dipper Novice Chase with the minimum of fuss. Paul Nicholls talked in glowing terms of the winner, cut into 5-1 from 8’s for the JLT Chase at the Festival, after his easy dismissal of Champagne West after the last fence. “Sam [Twiston-Davies] said that he raced a bit lazily today and that he hit a flat spot two out, but he winged the last and I was very pleased with the way he picked up the leader,” reported the trainer. “It was his fourth run in a short period of time but I wanted to get experience of Cheltenham into him. I won’t run him in the Arkle and while I think he will get three miles in time, he’ll be heading for the JLT at the Festival. “I’ll give him a break and find something in mid-February such as the Pendil at Kempton, while Irish Saint could run in the Scilly Isles at Sandown. He’ll definitely stay further and don’t be surprised if he’s a King George horse next year.” Young Jamie Bargary proved an able last-minute deputy as he rode Splash Of Ginge to victory in the BetBright Best For Festival Betting Handicap Chase. Called up after Ryan Hatch suffered a suspected broken collarbone following a fall in the previous contest, Bargary took his chance well to land the biggest success of his fledgling career. Trainer Nigel Twiston-Davies said: “Although it was only his sixth winner, Jamie is very good as he showed with a faultless display of jockeyship on his first ride without his 10lb claim. It will now be back to the novice route and the JLT is the one. I suppose Ptit Zig will be shaking in his shoes to hear that.” Mon Parrain, another winner for Nicholls, defied top weight to spring a surprise at 25-1 in the BetBright On Mobile Handicap Chase under up-and-coming claimer Sean Bowen, who later completed a double on his father Peter’s Rolling Maul. Helped by the application of blinkers for the first time as well as a tongue tie, Mon Parrain stepped up on his two previous starts this term to win convincingly. Nicholls said: “He was never going at Aintree last time, but I put some blinkers on him yesterday and he just took off in them. He has had his problems and you have to be careful with him but I’ll put him in the National and he might end up being Sean’s first ride in the race. “I do think Sean has come a long way in a year, he rides really well and horses seem to run for him. There were no orders, he just went out and made plenty of use of him and let the horse enjoy himself.” Thomas Brown turned in a battling front-running display to gain a narrow success in the Neptune Investment Management Novice Hurdle and start the meeting off on a winning note for Fry and Fehily. The winner is another the trainer has earmarked for the Festival. “This was valuable experience of Cheltenham, he’s obviously an out-and-out stayer and there’s no point looking at anything else other than the Albert Bartlett over three miles. I would like to have him fresh for the Festival, and doubt that he’ll run again before,” said Fry.",profile/tonypaley,paley,
105,2015-01-01T18:00:01Z,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/01/steve-carell-interview-foxcatcher-john-du-pont,Steve Carell on Foxcatcher and fame: ‘I’ve never cared about being taken seriously’,film,Film,The Guardian,"‘It was a huge opportunity for me. I didn’t think twice about it. It would have been crazy not to accept it.” Steve Carell is talking about his role in Foxcatcher, playing the wrestling-obsessed millionaire John du Pont, who in 1996 shot dead Dave Schultz, the coach of the US Olympic wrestling team that Du Pont had set up. Despite his track record of goofy comic turns and nice-as-pie straight men, Carell had no qualms about playing the role of a deeply disturbed killer. It’s actually turned out pretty well, career-wise: this spruce, neatly dressed 52-year-old already has a Golden Globe nomination under his belt, and there’s serious talk of an Oscar run. That, no doubt, explains Carell’s serious mien: Foxcatcher marks a new development in his profile. He’s done drama before, but always with a comedic edge – Crazy, Stupid, Love, for example, or The Way, Way Back. Foxcatcher is downright disturbing, a slowly accreting study of dysfunction and dependence that erupts in a startling act of violence. There are one or two half-smiles in it, but none associated with Carell’s Du Pont, who cuts a disturbing figure throughout. Carell is considered in his analysis of Du Pont, an eccentric individual to say the least, who was described by psychiatrists as psychotic and a paranoid schizophrenic during his trial after the Schultz murder. “I never saw him as a villain, and I didn’t want to depict him in that way,” says Carell. “Here was a guy who was the product of his upbringing, his enormous wealth. He was isolated to a great extent from many of the things that he longed for – and it was compounded with mental issues, of course. He was someone who didn’t possess the tools to achieve what he wanted out of life; and in that regard, incredibly heartbreaking.”    Steve Carell in Foxcatcher. Photograph: Photograph: Allstar   Foxcatcher’s main narrative deals with Du Pont’s installation of the gold-medal-winning Schultz brothers – first Mark, then Dave (Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo) – on his estate in Pennsylvania, part of his increasingly capricious plan to dominate the US Olympic team. By dangling large sums of money, Du Pont could buy up the largely college-based, amateur freestyle wrestlers who, the film is at pains to make clear, are very different from the razzle-dazzle pantomime acts of the pro circuit. (That particular branch of the sport, of course, has been mined in the Mickey Rourke film The Wrestler.) Carell says he and Foxcatcher’s director Bennett Miller – previously responsible for Moneyball and Capote – didn’t want to get into all “the lurid details”; meaning that, while Foxcatcher shows Du Pont imposing himself as a wrestling coach, giving himself odd nicknames, and devoting time to other hobbies such as the appreciation of heavy weaponry, it’s apparent that considerable pruning has been done. Perhaps most notably, the film makes no reference to Bulgarian wrestler Valentin Jordanov, with whom Du Pont was apparently obsessed, and for whom, the real-life Mark Schultz suggests, Du Pont committed the murder, as a “bizarre gift”. Carell takes the approach – clearly following Miller’s lead – that less is more as far as his portrayal of Du Pont. “Du Pont’s behaviour in real life was much more outrageous than what is depicted in the film. It would make it a more difficult leap for an audience to accept. How could these people stay within his circle in the face of the delusional, aggressive behaviour he exhibited? How could these people be so complicit? There was a transaction there; they all had a part in it, they all accepted it, they accepted the benefits.” They even shot a sequence in which – following a well-documented episode where Du Pont was given a wrestler’s haircut by Mark Schultz – the multimillionaire picked up a machine gun and began wildly firing from a veranda at imaginary enemies. “Didn’t get used,” says Carell. “It wasn’t Bennett’s agenda. It’s such a spare kind of movie. As a director, there’s nothing extraneous there. It’s very clean, very quiet. That was the approach to Du Pont as well, to reveal bits and pieces of him, and not reveal too much.”    Carell in his breakthrough role, The 40-year-old Virgin. Photograph: Allstar/UNIVERSAL/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar   Dwelling extensively on Du Pont’s psychosexual disposition would have made Foxcatcher a different film, but Carell – perhaps betraying a little of the uncertainty of someone dipping their toes into water outside their comfort zone – appears somewhat in awe of his director. He is fulsomely outspoken in his praise for Miller (“a special and talented film-maker”) and still appears slightly baffled how he got the role at all. “He saw in me the potential to do something I hadn’t done before.” Carell says his agent put him forward for the role without telling him; when he got the call from Miller it was “a pleasant surprise”. He also seems happy to be steered by Miller’s assessment of his career profile: “Bennett says I have a benign public persona, and Du Pont did too. I think that’s why he cast me.” Miller is not wrong. Carell, for all his renowned comedy-improv skills, exudes a niceness that verges on the bland. It’s hard enough to connect him with the stellar goofiness of Anchorman’s Brick Tamland, let alone the creepy self-infatuation of John du Pont. In the nicest possible way, Carell gently knocks back any suggestion that he has “dark places” himself that may have proved rewarding to disinter. “That would be a discussion with a therapist,” he says coyly. “But I didn’t need to do anything. Just to feel those rhythms, and feel where Bennett is going, and what the other actors are doing.” The closest Carell gets to suggesting anything remotely off-beam is the effect on his fellow cast members when he climbed into the unpleasant teeth-hair-skin additions necessary for the Du Pont role. “I was treated differently when I looked like that. It wasn’t anything we anticipated. Once I arrived on set, people kept a distance from me. I think that, in a way, paralleled how Du Pont felt in life, so it was a good thing.” This, apparently, extended to a remoteness from his co-stars Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo. “I didn’t get to know Mark or Channing very well while we were shooting. It wasn’t anything planned, we just naturally didn’t interact, aside from the scenes we were doing. We didn’t hang out, or bond.” However Carell takes fright at any suggestion he may be getting into method acting – “I’m so hesitant to talk about that, because it sounds so pretentious” – preferring instead to heap more praise on Miller. “To be honest, it comes from the director. Bennett set a tone that the film wasn’t going to be glib.” It also seems to have helped that both the real-life Mark Schultz and Dave’s wife, Nancy, turned up to watch the filming: “That added a responsibility and a weight to what we were doing. I think we all felt the impetus to take it seriously.”    Carell with Mark Ruffalo in Foxcatcher. Photograph: Sony Pictures/Courtesy Eve/R   All of which is a far cry, of course, from the competitive chuckleheadedness of Anchorman; he rolled on to the sequel straight after finishing Foxcatcher. “God, it could not have been more different. There was no levity at all when we were shooting Foxcatcher. Anchorman 2 was nothing but silly.” It begs the question: how did he manage it? Wasn’t there a culture shock? “I try to approach it all in the same way. I don’t think a character knows they are in a comedy or a drama. If Du Pont’s life hadn’t ended the way it did, it could be an absurdist comedy: a millionaire who likes wrestling.” Yes, but Carell is far from the first comic who has headed over to the serious side of town – and more than one has ended up losing the funny. Is he concerned? “Not really. To me, they are different styles of entertainment, with different methods. “I’ve never cared about being taken seriously – I just see myself as an actor. Most of my career, I’ve just taken what I’ve been offered. I always feel most comfortable as part of a ensemble. Whether it’s a comedy or a drama, I like to fit in. It’s best not to stick out.” By now, I’m thinking Carell is a most cautious film star. Perhaps the clue to it all comes via a throwaway line as it gets close to chucking-out time. Discussing his near-ubiquity since he hit the big time with The 40-Year-Old Virgin and the US version of The Office in 2005, Carell suddenly turns hard. “You know, that didn’t happen till I was 40. All of that came to pass after I had a long career as an actor. It sounds such an aw-shucks kind of thing to say, but I just wanted to make a living. That was the goal: to be able to have a family and support them.” All the carapace of professionalism, the studious responses, the thoroughly non-anarchic kidding around make a lot more sense if you consider what must have been a 20-year hack through the lower reaches of the improv comedy circuit, the painful process of guest-actor auditions and down-the-bill status jockeying. Carell has always been a bit of a poster boy for the joys of family life, but his stories about the impact of parenthood become intensely resonant. He launches into a well-rehearsed anecdote about trying out for a Julia Louis-Dreyfus sitcom called Watching Ellie shortly after the birth of his daughter. For him, the point is that fatherhood made him “relaxed”, and he ended up nailing it. But his analysis is telling: “For so long, the struggle was the career. The aim and goal was how to get the part, how to audition better, how to get ahead.” For once, I don’t feel sceptical when Carell says he feels “very thankful to be part of a movie like this” and “even more thankful for the success” he’s had in general. Hollywood cliches they may be, but in the decade or so since The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Carell has defied all expectations – his, as well as ours – to find himself inching closer to the very top of the tree. An Oscar nomination may or may not be waiting for him in the next fortnight, but he remains admirably phlegmatic about his future acting prospects. “You always strive to be part of something decent, or even good. That’s the hope. But I don’t have a masterplan; I never did. The worst thing that could happen is that you’re terrible. And you learn from that.” • Foxcatcher is released in the UK on 9 January",profile/andrewpulver,pulver,
106,2015-01-01T18:04:00Z,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/01/najia-warshaga-injured-palestinian-girl-symbol-gaza-war,Najia Warshaga: injured Palestinian girl who became symbol of Gaza war,world,World news,The Guardian,"The place where nine-year-old Najia Warshaga lives in Beit Lahia, Gaza, with her mother, Majdolen, and her five-year-old brother, Ali, was once the garage of a three-storey building. It is 50 metres square, there are a few mattresses on the ground for sitting and sleeping, and a few blankets for warmth piled in the corner. Their own home was bombed. They stayed for a while with an uncle at his home. Now they live here. The place has a little toilet which Majdolen, 31, cooks next to. The family’s laundry hangs on a rope warmed by the winter sun. It is a stark, cold and unhygienic place for which she has to pay 300 shekels a month (£50) despite having no income. In August, her daughter, Najia, became a symbol of the Gaza conflict – a picture of an injured girl, her weeping face smeared with blood. The image was taken by the Associated Press photographer Khalil Hamra and was shared on social media around the world after it featured on the Guardian’s front page.    The photo of Najia that became a symbol of the Gaza conflict. Photograph: Khalil Hamra/AP   The family had fled their rented apartment in Beit Lahia to the shelter of a UN school in nearby Jabaliya, also in northern Gaza, then to a second school where the family had sought sanctuary. Except it was not safe. Crowded with about 3,300 people, Najia and her family were sleeping in a classroom with seven other families when it was struck by a missile at 4.30am. Fifteen people were killed, and more than 100 were injured, including Najia, Majdolen and Ali. These days Najia is a symbol of something else. In a coastal strip where – according to some estimates – 100,000 people still remain displaced, Najia and her family have become a metaphor for the limbo into which many Palestinians have been pushed by the Gaza war. Najia has become a representative of not only the war but an aftermath that has barely been ameliorated. The nine-year-old seems a little less shy and withdrawn than last time the Guardian met her. Then she was almost catatonic, wrapping herself – her mother said then – in a blanket even in the August heat. Five months on she is more able to speak and smiles from time to time. But the trauma is still present. “I am OK now, but I still dream of the days of the war,” Najia says, echoing what many other children caught up in the violent events of the summer also describe. Nine days after the attack she had recounted to the Guardian what happened. “I was in classroom number one, sleeping,” she said then. “There was a huge boom. My mother hugged us, then another missile landed. I was screaming and crying.” Now, the worst nightmare, she say, is of the attack itself – being wakened out of sleep by the explosion into a world of smoke and carnage. “I dream of the moment when the school was hit. I have this nightmare that the classroom is falling in on us. Most of the nights I have that dream.” There is a piece of shrapnel in her leg which – like many other injured Palestinians – she has not been able to have removed because Gaza’s healthcare system is still recovering from the conflict. With the onset of the cooler weather – and the winter rainstorms – the shrapnel seems to bother her more. “I wish I could get it treated,” she says. “The pain in my leg bothers me more now it is winter. The doctors told me that they can’t take it out.” Her mother is more worried, however, about what the experience has done to her children psychologically. “Najia still can’t sleep like before the war, and she insists on sleeping next to me. She gets scared of every noise around. “One night recently there were some Israeli jets flying at night. She got up in panic and asked that we go to a neighbour’s house to sleep there. And we did it because it was the only way to calm her down.” What Majdolen describes is familiar to many parents in Gaza. Child surveys conducted after the war by several UN agencies and others paint a bleakly familiar picture including post-traumatic stress disorder, bed wetting, increased levels of aggression and anxiety, and nightmares. More positive is that Najia is back at school, enjoying the normality of learning and life in the classroom with her friends. It offers her a sense of hope in the future. “The teachers at school are good and they treat me well. I love my school,” she says. “I want to complete my studies and go to university.” Her father is in prison for fraud but it is hard for her mother to work with two children under 10 to care for. Majdolen is also still recovering from injuries to her head, eye and back. Without income, the family has been dependent on handouts from neighbours and family and UN food baskets every several months. “My family is poor but my mother gives me some money to pay for the expenses. I don’t need much,” says Majdolen. “But I need to have a life like other people … I don’t know what to do.”",profile/hazem-balousha,balousha,hazem

As the clock struck midnight on Thursday, and with Mitt Romney’s failed 2012 campaign still ringing in many Republican ears, the former Florida governor’s team quietly announced that their candidate was resigning from a slew of corporate boards and private equity interests that could cast a shadow over his presidential bid in 2016. Technically, Jeb Bush – son of President George Bush Sr and younger brother of President George W Bush – is still only “exploring” whether to seek the Republican nomination. But severing his many business ties means forgoing millions of dollars in consultancy earnings and is likely to prove almost as indicative of his determination to follow in family footsteps as did his announcement of a fundraising committee last month. Disentangling the extensive business interests that Bush has built up since standing down as governor in 2007 has not been a simple exercise. His first major resignation – as an adviser to Barclays following its purchase of Lehman Brothers – was confirmed by the British bank three weeks ago, after questions were raised about whether it and other controversial relationships could prove his achilles heel. He is also still reviewing what to do about some directly owned business interests such as the consulting firm Jeb Bush & Associates, according to the Washington Post, which first reported the latest news. Various private equity investments in energy and aviation, made through a company called Britton Hill that is named after the highest point in Florida, were only disclosed last June. At the time, such investments were widely interpreted as a sign that Jeb might have decided to heed his mother Barbara’s advice that there had already been enough Bushes in the White House. But the Republican establishment is anxious for a well-known candidate to challenge more radical rivals such as senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, and the Bush name is seen as the most reliable rallying point for wealthy donors and the business community after the New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, was tarnished by a political scandal in 2014. The purge of awkward legacies also indicates an appeal to conservative Republican voters in what is likely to be one of the most competitive primary races in years. Bush has relinquished his interests in Academic Partnerships, an education firm that serves of a reminder of his close involvement in school reforms that are loathed by many on the right. Other board resignations recently disclosed in regulatory filings include Rayonier, which invests in forest land, and Tenet Healthcare, which reportedly profited from Barack Obama’s controversial healthcare reforms. But Bush has so far been unapologetic about his support for what are seen by some in his party as Democratic causes, such as common education standards and immigration reform. He said on Wednesday that he would not be attending a conservative summit hosted by the Iowa congressman Steve King, which is traditionally seen as a vital first step on the Republican primary race. He has also pledged greater transparency, including the publication of emails from his time as governor of Florida, although his spokeswoman did not respond to several calls and emails on Thursday about the corporate resignations and there was no mention of the decision on the Facebook page that his office used to announce his presidential plans. Aides told the Post that the New Year business purge was about “making time” to explore these presidential interests and “part and parcel of a process he is going through as he transitions to focus on a potential run for president”. The decision was a “natural next step”, said his spokeswoman, Kristy Campbell, in separate confirmation to CNN, as Bush “turns his focus to gauging whether there is support for a potential candidacy”. Bush has insisted that his private equity interests are not on the same scale as Romney’s history with Bain Capital, which proved an attractive target for Democrats during his fight against Obama in 2012, due its alleged asset-stripping and firing policies. The other contenders Among the likely Republican candidates for the 2016 presidential race, Jeb Bush may be the most advanced in his declared interest, but his rivals are not far behind. “The more the merrier,” said the Kentucky senator Rand Paul when Bush first announced he was “exploring” a run in December, one of many indications that Paul’s participation in the contest is in as little doubt as that of his equally ambitious conservative colleague Ted Cruz. The Florida senator Marco Rubio also announced in a New Year’s Day radio interview that he was “spending the holidays thinking about his future”. The unusually early launch of team Bush was thought to be aimed partly at deterring other establishment competitors such as Rubio and the New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, but their public prominence since and Mitt Romney’s strong performance in polling suggests it may have only spurred them on. And with governors from Indiana’s Mike Pence to Rick Perry of Texas and Scott Walker of Wisconsin dropping similar hints in recent days, the easier question among top Republicans is who isn’t running?",profile/dan-roberts,Dan,Roberts
108,2015-01-01T18:14:57Z,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/01/city-link-army-self-employed-count-cost-failure,City Link’s army of self-employed workers count cost of business failure,business,Business,The Guardian,"On New Year’s Eve, more than 2,300 workers at City Link found out their jobs had been axed. But more than 1,000 self-employed van drivers and agency workers who earned a living from the failed parcel delivery firm will not receive a redundancy letter. John Baginton, a 54-year-old van driver, has had no communication from the company since he found out from a news website on Christmas Day that his job was gone. “It has left a bitter taste in my mouth. I still haven’t had a letter or an email to say my job’s finished. Nothing from head office to say ‘thanks for your loyalty’. They didn’t even send a text message.” Baginton, not his real name, was never counted as an employee by City Link. Although he worked for City Link, and its predecessor Direct Express, for nine years, he has never been on the payroll. In City Link parlance, he is a “service delivery partner”. In other words, a contract worker with no guaranteed hours, sick pay, holiday pay or entitlement to redundancy. City Link owe him £2,400 for three weeks’ work. But he doesn’t expect to see any of this money: “I very much doubt it, as we will be the last of the last [on the creditors’ list].” Even after last-minute talks to save the firm failed, City Link was still advertising on its website for “passionate” people who wanted to be their own boss. The firm, owned by multimillionaire Jon Moulton, claimed that drivers could earn £43,000 a year. Phil Valentine, a contractor who has worked for City Link “on and off” for six years and runs six vans, dismissed the £43,000 figure. Once a driver paid for fuel, insurance and a weekly charge for a van, earnings would be more like £28,000 a year. Baginton said: “Gross-wise it looks good, but net-wise you are probably looking at around half of that [£43,000].” Officially self-employed, he paid his own taxes and national insurance. Work started at 4.30 in the morning and sometimes didn’t finish until 7.30 at night. Holidays were rare, because it was hard to find a replacement driver. “If we have two weeks’ holiday, it will take us two months to recover. It is a double whammy. First because you lose your wages and second because you have to pay someone else to do your job.” Illness was an even bigger problem. Last year, City Link docked him £75 for missing a morning’s work after he came down with food poisoning. “I rang in sick the night before and I said I didn’t feel well. They rang throughout the morning and asked ‘where are you?’” He went in at lunchtime, still feeling unwell, but found out a week later he had been fined. “I asked my boss: ‘What’s this charge for?’ And he said it would have been £150 if I had missed the whole day. So I had gone in sick and I had basically worked for free. “Before Christmas I had a chest infection for two weeks and my wife was saying I should stay at home. But you can’t. You have it at the back of your mind: ‘I am going to get charged.’” City Link contract drivers are part of an army of self-employed labour that has boomed during the recession. Around 4.6 million people are self-employed in the UK, 15% of the working population, the highest proportion for 40 years, according to the Office for National Statistics. The biggest growth category for self employment is not consultants tapping away on laptops in cafes, but taxi drivers, carpenters and bricklayers. Delivery workers are not counted separately in the statistics, but there is little doubt their numbers have grown as Britons have embraced online shopping. Around 1.7bn parcels were delivered in the UK in 2012, up from 1.3bn in 2005, according to PWC. Amid fierce competition for a slice of the £7bn parcel market, costs are being squeezed, especially as big customers, such as Amazon, develop their own delivery networks. “There is constant downward pressure on parcel carriers which they can only deal with by economies of scale,” said one distribution industry source. Mike Parkinson, a City Link contractor who is owed £7,500 for unpaid work, saw higher payments for early-morning deliveries dropped after Better Capital took control of the firm in 2013. He could be fined if he missed a delivery slot. Baginton was paid £2.15 per delivery, no matter how many items were going to one house. “I could have 20 parcels and that is classed as one stop and I get paid the same.” Sometimes he delivered flat-pack furniture stamped with “2-man lift” for the same £2.15 rate he would be paid for delivering a T-shirt. Mike Cain, an employment lawyer at Slater & Gordon, who successfully fought for compensation for warehouse workers and delivery drivers working for the collapsed Comet retail business, said: “Self-employed contracts are playing a major part in the so-called economic revival. Under such contracts, worker rights and access to legal protection are minimised if not removed altogether and the risk and the costs if a business fails are being shifted downwards.” Trade unions are worried this model will spread to the whole industry, including the Royal Mail, now in private hands. “While the parcel market has grown quickly, so too has the number of operators at an even faster rate. The same principle applies to post and the UK’s 650-year-old post operator, Royal Mail, faces intense pressure of its own,” said Billy Hayes, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union. He accuses the regulator, Ofcom, of shirking its responsibilities by failing to apply standards to fledgling companies that will do anything to undercut the Royal Mail. “One of the worst impacts of Ofcom’s current approach to let the free market have its head is the downward pressure they support, to reduce pay and terms and conditions, and encourage a race to the bottom for workers.” Ofcom said parliament was ultimately responsible for regulating workers’ rights. “Ofcom has a duty to secure the universal service for postal users. We do not regulate terms of employment, which are for individual companies to determine.” The department of business, innovation and skills said the government was conducting a review into “how to make a person’s employment status clearer and how this affects their employment rights”. “Workers and businesses should be free to agree the terms of an employment relationship and the government does not want to restrict people’s ability to choose how they work. This ensures a flexible and vibrant labour market, supporting growth and delivering jobs.” Meanwhile, Baginton is consulting a solicitor friend for advice about his rights. “I don’t think the government realise what this job entails,” he says.",profile/jennifer-rankin,Jennifer,Rankin
109,2015-01-01T18:16:45Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/01/frank-lampard-loan-manchester-city-new-york-abu-dhabi,A tale of two cities: Frank Lampard loan shows Manchester trumps New York,football,Football,The Guardian,"So all those fans who bought tickets for New York City FC’s first Major League Soccer game at Yankee Stadium in March will not, after all, get to see the most prolific English midfielder of his generation. Instead, Frank Lampard will be bolstering Manchester City’s Premier League title challenge right up to the end of the English season in May. The 36-year-old, who captained England while winning his 106th and final cap against Costa Rica in June, had been due to arrive in New York this month, to train with his new team-mates ahead of the start of the US season. But ever since the surprise announcement in August that he would join Manchester City on a short-term loan, speculation has mounted that he might stay longer. As the ball dropped in Times Square to mark the start of 2015, speculation turned to stark reality. In all likelihood, Lampard will miss the first three months of the MLS season. At his unveiling back in July Lampard described New York City FC as “ticking all the boxes” and, referring to his plans to visit the 9/11 memorial in the city, said: “It’s very important to pay respect.” It’s safe to say that respect was not the word on the lips of the fans trying to build support and an identity for the new New York soccer franchise when news of Lampard’s change of plan broke.  Both New York City and Manchester City are owned by City Football Group, the vehicle of Sheikh Mansour, the deputy prime minister of the United Arab Emirates and scion of the ruling family of Abu Dhabi. However, any notion that both clubs held an equal status in the Emiratis’ global football empire have been roundly dispelled. Sure, winning MLS would be nice but for the Middle Eastern money men calling the shots, the EPL and the Champions League are where the glory lies. New York City FC’s director of football, Claudio Reyna, put a brave face on the matter, saying: “Frank is a star and it is no surprise that Manchester City is rewarded by his contributions on the field every single day. He is eager to get to New York once his commitment ends in England and will be available to play on arrival as a permanent member of the squad given he will come to us having played at the highest level.” The New York team are probably wise to grin and bear it, since their place in the pecking order – below Manchester City but above Melbourne City – was established back in October when their other star signing, the former Spain striker David Villa, was recalled to the Big Apple early from his loan at Melbourne, the Emiratis’ Australian outfit. Clearly, such decisions are made not in New York, Manchester or Melbourne, but in Abu Dhabi. Lampard, along with Villa, was the major draw card for New York City FC as they sought to attract fans to the 50,000-capacity Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, where they will play their inaugural MLS season. The former England man promised to bring some much-needed star power to a league – and a city – that had just lost the former France great Thierry Henry from the Red Bulls. With MLS adding two new teams for the 2015 season, marquee names are in more demand than ever. Supporters, not unreasonably, feel cheated. “Many fans, including our members, decided to support the team, committed to season tickets, and bought merchandise under the impression that Frank Lampard would be playing for New York City Football Club, not Manchester City,” the New York fans’ group Third Rail said in a statement.    Lampard celebrates after scoring Manchester City’s third goal against Sunderland on Thursday. Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA   Over in England, supporters of Chelsea were already feeling pretty sore about the deal that took Lampard to Manchester in the first place. Waving your record goalscorer off to spend his footballing twilight years across the Atlantic is one thing; watching him pitch up at your main rivals and then deny his former team three points at the Etihad via a late equaliser is quite another. On New Year’s Day Lampard demonstrated once again the impact he can have on the title race when he scored the winner against Sunderland at the Etihad, bringing his City goal total to seven. Chelsea will win little sympathy, given that the form of Lampard’s replacement, Cesc Fàbregas, hasn’t been too shabby . If they had wanted to avoid facing Lampard, they could simply have renewed his contract in the summer.  NYCFC could in theory have pointed to the contract Lampard signed with them and insisted to Manchester City that he honour it. But one can imagine how that conversation with Sheikh Mansour would go. The Third Rail supporters’ group gallantly declared: “We reject out of hand any suggestion that NYCFC is in any way secondary to Manchester City FC, regardless of the source, and are disappointed that City Football Group would give such an appearance.” Like it or not, though, for NYCFC’s owners there’s clearly only one City that counts.",profile/christaylor,taylor,

The figures speak for themselves: 11,313 miners were arrested, 5,653 put on trial, 200 imprisoned and, as a result of convictions, 960 miners were sacked by the National Coal Board.

But it turns out that it is a form of sustainability that has more to do with the developer’s bank balance than creating sustainable communities or protecting the environment. The principal casualty is the number of affordable homes built. By 2018, there will be a million fewer than in 1980. The NPPF enshrines commercial viability at the very heart of negotiations with the local authority. It says that development proposals “should not be subject to such a scale of obligations and policy burdens that their ability to be developed viably is threatened”. But how viability is determined is the crucial factor. And that is a calculation that happens entirely behind closed doors – and one for which the very people assessing the applications are effectively blindfolded. House-builders, claiming commercial confidentiality which they have lobbied fiercely to protect, obscure the financial modelling used to determine whether a scheme is viable in their eyes. It is shielded from the council and entirely hidden from public gaze. Broadly, the assessment subtracts building costs from projected revenue, while safeguarding a 20% profit margin. The slightest tweak of a single variable can prove that a project would simply be financially unworkable if the required affordable housing quota was fulfilled. Independent analysis shows that profits are routinely underestimated, costs overstated, and the number of affordable homes relentlessly driven down. Councils simply don’t have the in-house expertise to scrutinise these reports and they rarely commission independent assessments. When they do, they are forced to rely on the very consultants used by the property industry, who are loth to contradict their paymasters. But after several community groups succeeded in getting the books opened up on major regeneration schemes across London, the dark art of fiddling viability figures is under increasing public scrutiny. Residents evicted from the Heygate Estate won a two-year battle against Southwark to release the viability assessment made for Lend Lease, the developers. The report justified the controversial plan to replace 1,200 mainly social-rented homes with over 2,300 units, of which a mere quarter will be classed as affordable. Initial findings by critics of the scheme suggest the report grossly undervalued the development. At Capco’s redevelopment of Earls Court in west London, barely one in 10 of the 7,000 new homes will be affordable and none will be for social rent. An assessment commissioned by opponents of the scheme found that the developer’s valuations were “warped”. The same meagre share was proposed for the Royal Mail site at Mount Pleasant in north London, although an independent report suggested that in such a high house price area, half the housing could be affordable. Until viability calculations are published, councils will be powerless to stop this great housing con trick.",profile/editorial,editorial,

No single weather event is evidence of climate change, but the freak weather of those months left no one in any doubt of what an extreme weather event would look like. There was nothing more for the climate change scientists to add. This time next year, the Paris summit that holds out the best hope for a broad, UN-brokered agreement on cutting carbon emissions will be over. It is of universal importance that a deal is struck that is ambitious and achievable. There are several reasons why that looks more possible now than it has done for years. President Barack Obama clearly hopes that he can make climate change part of his legacy. He is reportedly ready to use his powers to override Congressional opposition to his proposal for a cut in carbon emissions, by 2025, of between 26% and 28% over the 2005 level. The US readiness to make a commitment was matched by China’s president Xi Jinping, for the first time, offering a date for “peak” carbon emissions of 2030. The agreement, announced in November after the two leaders met in China, was welcomed by the UN’s climate change chief, Christiana Figueres, who said it would make a real contribution to the success of the Paris conference. And the EU has agreed to a 40% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared with 1990, as well as to new targets for the generation of renewable energy. There was progress at Lima, the final preparatory summit for Paris, where a new series of objectives was outlined. They leave a lot to the imagination but the process of eroding some of the biggest of the roadblocks to a deal in December is under way. So, although there is still no obligation on the developing countries of Brazil, Russia, India or China to cut emissions, they have accepted the need for a cap and the world is no longer divided into developing and developed countries. And while it proved impossible to agree a system of measurement or monitoring, there is an obligation on all 190 or so countries to produce a plan in the next three months to cut emissions. But climate change is above all a matter of equity – equity between rich world and poor world, equity between generations. A deal in Paris demands moral leadership. This Christmas, Pope Francis showed that he for one is willing to provide it. He has promised that he will take the rare step of issuing an encyclical, a letter to the world’s Catholic bishops to be read from every pulpit emphasising the responsibility of all Catholics to take action, on scientific as well as moral grounds. He will drive home his argument at a summit of world religious leaders, and then in an address to the UN general assembly. However equivocal scientists may feel about having God on their side, it is unlikely to damage their prospects of success. Paris has been 20 years in the making. As the former EU commissioner for climate action, Connie Hedegaard, has emphasised, negotiators will be sipping their champagne in the last-chance saloon for UN-led action. At Copenhagen in 2009, Ms Hedegaard pulled, if not victory, then real progress from the jaws of defeat when all the major carbon emitters accepted there must be curbs, and it is through her efforts that there is the change for a new agreement to be signed off this year. Regrettably, her successor, Miguel Arias Cañete, the Spanish former director of two oil companies, may not bring quite the same energy and commitment to the role. The essentials for an effective deal are easy to spell out. There must be clarity and certainty, so that every country knows what has to be done, and business can see where to invest. It must be a deal for the long term, fair to all its participants, with funding to allow transition to new low-carbon technologies, and to underwrite adaptation for those countries that will be worst affected by the impacts of global warming. There will be plenty of argument over whether this is a treaty or a protocol or a binding instrument with legal force. In the end, what matters is an agreement – of any kind.",profile/editorial,editorial,
114,2015-01-01T18:26:36Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jan/01/manchester-city-sunderland-talking-points,Manchester City 3-2 Sunderland: five talking points,football,Football,The Guardian,"1) Manchester City respond after Burnley – only just Manchester City’s Manuel Pellegrini was exasperated by the fashion of Burnley’s comeback to draw 2-2 at the Etihad in their previous outing, the manager reminding his players afterwards they must not let up until the final whistle. There will then have been despair at the deja vu all over again that unfolded before the Chilean’s eyes as his side spurned a two-goal cushion against a visiting team for a consecutive outing. City managed to get over the line here but there are signs their early season struggles could again return to undermine them when the business side of the campaign arrives. 2) Touré shows what Pellegrini will miss Forget about a tweet, send a message on a 25-yard rocket that bursts the Sunderland net and tells the manager to consider carefully the next time he wants to rest his star midfielder. Yaya Touré had challenged Pellegrini’s explanation for not playing him by stating on Twitter: “Just a note to say the boss rested me for the Burnley game, I am not injured …! I really hope to be involved against Sunderland! #ComeOnCity!” The Ivorian is off to the Africa Cup of Nations so is keen to play before his departure around 10 January and on an afternoon that caught fire only late on he was City’s best footballer, his opening strike the catalyst in what became a vital three points gained. 3) Caballero given a rare chance in goal Was the Argentinian’s inclusion related to the England goalkeeper Joe Hart’s display against Burnley when he might have done better with the opener, a George Boyd touch that beat him despite diving the right way? If so, this would seem a harsh decision. And if Pellegrini gave Willy Caballero a second Premier League start only to rest Hart then this could be filed under “odd” as the latter has stated he dislikes not playing for this reason. Caballero talks of challenging for the starting berth and turned in a professional display, making an impressive save from a Sebastian Larsson free-kick in the first half while being able to do little about Jack Rodwell’s header or Adam Johnson’s penalty. 4) Return to default system works thanks to Lampard Injuries to Sergio Agüero, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic had forced Pellegrini into a switch, saying before kick-off: “We have changed the style of play in the past few weeks and we have been doing well while our strikers recover their fitness. We prepared a different style in training, one that gives the midfielders time to arrive at the edge of the box and so we are creating more space.” On Thursday, the false No9 James Milner was dropped for a traditional centre-forward in Jovetic but not until the latter was replaced by the evergreen Frank Lampard did City have their winner, as the midfielder registered a seventh goal this season. 5) The fit-at-last Rodwell proves a factor Having been dropped from Sunderland’s matchday squad against Aston Villa the former City schemer was reinstated by Gus Poyet and scored a fine header after the break. In the half season Jack Rodwell has been at the Black Cats there have already been more Premier League starts – this was his 11th – than the seven registered in an injury-blighted two years at the Etihad Stadium. This has been the good news for the 23-year-old, though he has struggled to convince Poyet, with the manager saying about leaving him out: “I want him to react now.” Rodwell did in the best way.",profile/jamiejackson,jackson,jamie

David Goodwillie’s superb overhead kick sent the Dons on their way to their sixth straight league victory, which was made safe by Cammy Smith’s injury-time goal. McInnes said: “We can’t deny that is a great feeling to be at the top of the league. We said it was all about the game today and that it was another three points up for grabs, just like any other game, but that extra bit of motivation to go top of the league is something that the players recognised. “The players looked ready to play today, even before we knew about the Celtic game being postponed, and it was a top performance. It just shows what they are capable of and they should feel good about themselves tonight.” Elsewhere, Hamilton surpassed their 4-0 away victory over Motherwell as Ian Baraclough was brought crashing back down to earth following wins in his first two games as Motherwell manager. First-half goals from Dougie Imrie and Ali Crawford at New Douglas Park sent Accies on their way to another Lanarkshire derby destruction. And strikes from the Scottish Premiership’s two top scorers, Mickaël Antoine-Curier and Tony Andreu, and the substitute Danny Redmond, secured a 5-0 win for Alex Neil’s side, who moved three points behind champions Celtic.",,,

He’s played a neo-Nazi psychopath and a foul-tempered newsman. His portrayal of a raging, violent conductor in the incendiary jazz thriller Whiplash has made him the frontrunner for the best supporting actor at the Oscars in February. He gives the performance of his career by bellowing at a roomful of whimpering milksops who just won’t keep the beat. In person, Simmons is an avuncular gent, as drily good-natured as the cuddly dad he played in Juno. Whisked around the world on the award-season campaign trail, he’s treating it all – the deferential PRs, the earnest journos, the elaborate menu of this week’s five-star hotel – as an amusing oddity. After 20 years of supporting roles and being ninth on the call sheet, he’s happy to play the game and too experienced to take it seriously. At least this time he believes in what he’s selling. “I’ve had some experiences in the last few years where my reticence to be involved in the publicity has not been helpful,” he says. “It’s so nice to be doing this as a part of a film that I can be unreservedly glowing about and not feel like I have to spin anything. I can be 100% honest and I don’t have to bullshit.”      Whiplash has plenty of momentum. It needs no more spin. Shot in just over two weeks, the second feature from 29-year-old writer-director Damien Chazelle stars Miles Teller as Andrew, a gifted jazz drummer seduced into a world of punishing exactitude by his brutal conservatoire teacher, Terrence Fletcher (Simmons). Fletcher – bald, muscular, black of heart and wardrobe – runs an ensemble like a military unit. He stops his band by clenching a fist. If his players mess up, he throws a chair at their heads. Then he takes them through the exercise again. And again. Through the night if need be. Fletcher doesn’t care about them, he cares about their talent. And he’ll do anything to force them to realise it. Make them play and play until they hit it. There’s no “can do”, plenty of “screw you”. The band are all male, and Fletcher is liberal in his use of homophobic slurs. He will happily insult and upset to raise the standard. Dubbed Full Metal Juilliard by some critics, the film could come across as preposterously macho. But it’s Simmons’s commitment to Fletcher’s raging perfectionism that keeps you in the piece. You can’t laugh at Fletcher, no matter how silly his screaming about a dropped quaver seems. You’re too afraid to.    Simmons with Miles Teller in Whiplash. Photograph: Moviestore/Rex   Whiplash argues that we’ve become soft. Encouragement is given too easily, punishment is seen as monstrous. The two most harmful words of the English language are “good job”, says Fletcher. Simmons doesn’t agree with the methods, but sometimes he can see Fletcher’s point. “There’s a kind of numbness, a sameness, a lack of motivation in ‘good job’ culture,” he says. On this press tour, he’s been using the example of parents watching their kid on a playground slide. Gravity does all the work, then mum and dad go nuts. It really isn’t a cause for celebration. “We’re raising a generation of kids who are being overly praised for incredibly minor accomplishments,” he says. “I think it’s counter-productive.” Simmons, 59, was born Jonathan Kimble Simmons (he became JK when he started working in film, “well before Ms Rowling had her Potter books”). He grew up in Detroit, where his dad, Donald, was a college music teacher. There’s nothing of him in Fletcher, although Simmons’s sister, an English professor at the University of Washington, sends him clippings of Whiplash photos saying how much he looks like their father (“She hasn’t seen the movie yet”).      “Most of my friends – when I was five, six, seven years old – their dads were working in an auto plant in Detroit until 5.30 and then they were sat in rush hour,” he says. “They weren’t around as much. My dad finished at three o’clock, so he was just around more. He was ahead of his time in being a hands-on dad. This was the 50s and 60s. Dads would come home and sit and read the paper and the wife would fetch the slippers. He and my mother had a much more forward-thinking relationship”. He moved to Ohio and spent his teenage years playing high-school football before his knees fell apart, forcing him to quit. “I went from being a jock to a hippie,” he says. “It was a very clear-cut decision. I had to be one or the other. I had to forsake that other aspect of myself. Or thought that I had to, which is regrettable. Quickly, I was back in the pine trees with the hippies, listening to my Jimi Hendrix and my Janis Joplin and turning on, tuning in and dropping out.” You could argue that, professionally, Simmons has been wandering between the football field and the pines ever since. After studying music composition at college and singing on Broadway, he moved into a TV career that saw him play stern, stylish hard arses. His recurring role as sceptical NYPD psychiatrist Dr Emil Skoda in Law & Order set up his stall as an authority figure. As Vernon Schillinger, the fascist rapist of the groundbreaking 90s HBO prison drama Oz, Simmons projected a terrifying persona despite his slight frame.    With Ellen Page in Juno. Photograph: FoxSearch/Everett/Rex   His film characters tend to be more laidback. He played J Jonah Jameson for Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man films and was brutish, but only for comic effect. Jason Reitman, who Simmons credits for helping him make headway in movies, often casts him as a shambolic father figure, something that has stuck when he moved into the mainstream. Whether a garrulous IBS sufferer (in the Coen brothers remake of The Ladykillers) or a soft-hearted dean (in Hugh Grant romcom The Rewrite), Simmons tends to be the guy you’d be happy turning on, tuning in and dropping out with. Perhaps this is why Fletcher is delivered with such conviction. He’s the actor’s first big-screen alpha male in a while: the uber-jock. The sports coach screaming on the sidelines as young, impressionable talent fails to meet up to his impossibly high standards. Whiplash shares the structure of a classic sports drama. There’s the hot young talent, the grizzled old pro, the rise through the ranks and the inevitable price to pay. The last 20 minutes – the final game of the season – is a flat-out headrush, with Andrew hammering to make something of all of the blood, sweat and paradiddles. Is Fletcher taking back some of the territory that, as a teenage hippy, Simmons left behind? Perhaps, he says. At the very least, the jock mindset still has its pull. “I was talking to an old friend recently,” he says. “There had been a picture in the papers of me as Fletcher and he said: ‘Wow, man. You’re in really good shape! Flashing the guns!’ I was like: ‘There’s this inner ninth-grade jock who takes this great pride and satisfaction in that aspect of this character. The whole fucking macho thing that you develop as you hit puberty never goes away.’ His response was: ‘We all have that inner ninth-grade jock. Embrace it.’” • Whiplash is released in the UK on 16 January",profile/henrybarnes,barnes,
117,2015-01-01T18:30:02Z,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/01/little-punk-jazz-shoegaze-the-new-blues,"‘A little punk, a little jazz, a little shoegaze’: meet the new blues",music,Music,The Guardian,"‘When you think of blues,” Ike Turner once mused, “all you think about is crying guitar like BB King’s guitar. You think about someone crying that their woman’s gone. And how bad life is and all that. Why can’t it be something happy with the blues? Why can’t it have a hip-hop beat to which you can do the dances of today?”  Since its inception in the American south in the early years of the 20th century, the blues has been repeatedly rethought, redreamed, restructured and re-presented; from the early blues WC Handy heard played in a Tutwiler railway station, to the female blues singers such as Mamie Smith and Ma Rainey in the 1920s, the Delta blues of Robert Johnson, and the electric blues of T-Bone Walker, and on to the British blues of the 50s and 60s that brought Alexis Korner, Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones and Eric Clapton, as well as more recent incarnations, led by the White Stripes and the Black Keys. It has spun out from spirituals and slave plantations, crossed gender, race, class, states, rivers and oceans, and been played in juke joints, cellar bars, concert halls and stadiums. But where does it now stand, and where is it headed? In the summer of 2010, Jim Fusilli, the rock and pop critic for the Wall Street Journal, travelled to the 31st Blues Foundation annual gala in Memphis, and his resulting report sounded puzzled and somewhat disappointed: “I heard folk blues, country blues, jump blues, Chicago blues, Delta blues, Texas blues, fast blues, slow blues, good blues and bad blues,” he wrote. “What I didn’t hear was new blues.” Fusilli wondered what the future of the genre might be, and like Turner, considered the possibility of the blues rethought: “Young fans who still fuel the music marketplace may admire veterans like Mr [Buddy] Guy, but they’re right to ask if there’s a new way to play the blues, one that’s affiliated with new sounds and styles.” As Fusilli found, there exists an uneasy situation in the blues world – on the one hand stands a core fanbase savouring the more traditional forms of the blues, and on the other presses the need for a genre to remain vital rather than simply preserved. In recent times, the blues has begun to twist and turn once again, with a raft of new artists embracing and embroidering the form. Where the blues of the White Stripes was sparse and pared-back, the latest take seems fuller, more elaborate. Consider, for example, Rag’N’Bone Man’s melding of hip-hop and blues, the rootsy blues-rock of Alabama Shakes or the twisted desert blues of DD Dumbo. Benjamin Booker released his debut album on Rough Trade earlier this year. Twenty-five years old, a Florida native transplanted to New Orleans, Booker cites the influence of the Gun Club and T Rex as much as Blind Willie Johnson, and was led to the blues by more contemporary artists. “If I liked a band, I tried to find out who they would listen to,” he explains. “So the White Stripes were big when I was a kid, and Nirvana did a cover of Where Did You Sleep Last Night?, which is how I found Lead Belly’s music.”    The result is a musical style that reflects that mingling of contemporary and traditional genres. “I played everything I heard,” he says. “I like acoustic, Delta blues, I like the Alan Lomax recordings – those are quite creepy in a way that the Chicago blues weren’t. But I didn’t want to be one of those blues purist guys – I don’t see a reason to do anything twice. So I put a little punk, a little jazz, a little shoegaze.” The difference between Booker’s music and that of the White Stripes or the Black Keys is, he suggests, simply generational: “When Jack White was looking at the blues he was combining it with what he listened to when he was growing up – he had people like the Gun Club, who I’ve only more recently started getting into. So what he listened to growing up was different to what I listened to growing up, but every music takes something from blues. If you listen to the Jesus and Mary Chain, there’s soul in there. If you listen to any of the old blues guys there’s a lot of innuendo and whatever in there — it’s the same as rap, but 80 years before.” “I loved the fact that he was as immersed in modern music as he was the country blues,” says Geoff Travis, founder of Rough Trade Records, the label that signed Booker, and before him the Alabama Shakes. “I thought the music was thrilling and the voice seemed to convey something heartfelt. That is somewhat rare. It did no harm that he reminded us of Jimi Hendrix a little, in the way he uses feedback and moves on stage sometimes. Also the beat was right, unrelenting, and danceable. Why can’t we dance to modern rock’n’roll very often? “What is the new twist?” he continues. “Maybe the filter and knowledge of punk and blues-inspired punk. This is a different route than the way the Stones got there, Jimmy Rogers and Muddy Waters being twin pillars. Just two examples of many, but Chuck Berry is in common and of course Otis Redding and the whole school of southern soul. But talent comes in to it, too. People aren’t simply the sum of their influences and upbringing and culture. The Alabama Shakes and Benjamin have the talent to stake a claim that few people actually do.” Australian musician Oliver Perry, recording under the stage name of DD Dumbo, is another young artist who is leading the blues somewhere new. Using guitar, voice and Tanzanian ilimba, his music is looped and reverbed and droned to create a sound that marries African desert blues and Tuvan melody, and has as much in common with the work of Tune-Yards as Booker. Speaking from Australia, Perry talks about his love for Ali Farka Touré, Howlin’ Wolf and Lightnin’ Hopkins’ style of guitar: “I feel he’s understanding lead lines, that I might do something similar, naturally,” he says. “It feels soulful in a particular way.”    Like Jack White, Perry finds creativity in some of the restrictions of the blues form: “One aspect of American blues that has influenced me is that it sticks in one scale,” he says. “It’s a trance element, not in a modular sense, to think of it droning in one key. A lot of the time using a loop pedal is why I’m forced to stay in one key, and then I’ve only got a certain number of notes around that. Then it becomes almost like a blues because it’s stuck in that form.” Earlier this year an artist named Rag’N’Bone Man released a cover of House of the Rising Sun. A traditional folk song made famous by the Animals, it tells of a life gone awry in New Orleans. Rag’N’Bone Man’s version was named simply Rising Sun and revealed a quaking, belly-deep voice that also featured the Newcastle rapper Stig of the Dump. Rag’N’Bone Man is Rory Graham, raised in Brighton, not the Bayou, but introduced to the world of the blues via his parents’ record collection. “I would flick through them,” Graham says, “and a couple of records stood out – John Lee Hooker and J J Cale. It’s quite difficult to explain, but I think certain people are drawn to certain sounds.” At the same time he was discovering hip-hop, and realising the productions weren’t all that dissimilar. As a performer, Graham was drawn to the physical sensation of singing the blues. “I can’t think and sing at the same time,” he says. “I close my eyes and that’s the only thing. Whatever your view of the blues, whether you’re a purist or not, it’s a magnet. It draws you in because it’s the blueprint for music, for everything, even the pop you hear in the charts. So it’s no wonder people go back to it.”    But he wanted it to be just one element of his music. “I also wanted to create something new,” he says. “I explored blues a lot, but I explore all kinds of stuff. I love old soul, I love funk and folk, Marvin Gaye, Otis Redding, Martin Carthy, Fairport Convention, Richard Thompson. I’d like to think people can recognise the sounds they hear in my music and relate to them.” Wearing influences easily is part of the blues tradition – this is a genre in which whole songs, verses, lines and refrains are recycled and remade, in which performers have reinvented themselves, remodeled their music and their show to ape another. Booker talks of how he is equally influenced by garage rock bands and blues musicians: “Charley Patton throwing his guitar up in the air and catching it. Robert Johnson turning away from the audience to play. I mean these guys were definite showmen, showing up in town and trying to get an audience.” Meanwhile Geoff Travis refers to “Jack White’s almost vaudevillian country blues artifice in his vocal mimicry, something I really like, but you smile at the pantomime. Listen to Son House, for example. We now know that blues artists were themselves not above singing the popular songs of the day and mimicking the vaudeville heroes and heroines themselves.” But for some, the issue of authenticity does niggle. “I have a very particular take on things,” says Janice Monti, professor of sociology at Dominican University in Illinois, and director of the Blues and Spirit Symposium. “I’ve been arguing for a long time that the blues has been jacked. Most [new blues musicians] are white males, American, European, Australian – and that’s not to take away at all from the talent and the innovation of these young people, but there is this little-addressed but important issue: if we’re looking at blues legacy, blues aesthetic, it’s a history of a legacy of oppression, but also a black aesthetic. “Blues is celebrated, but there are no black people at the party. That kind of colour blindness results in yet another blues revival that almost exclusively ignores and marginalises black artists. White males are predominant. The black artists are not there. It’s reflective of a false postracial mentality that it’s whites who are the ones who are innovating. Who gets to tell the story? And what story are they telling? It’s interesting to me that this salient cultural product, which is the backbone of all popular music, has been so disrespected.” Booker, an African-American, is certainly aware of his heritage – he talks of Blind Willie Johnson and Furry Lewis, of how “it was so refreshing to hear just one man and a guitar, to have black men, in the 20s and 30s, putting themselves out there in a way that I can’t even imagine it.” The writer James Baldwin is also important to Booker, Travis says. “So there is something going on there with an understanding of the underbelly of American black culture and for its need for self-determination, respect and civil rights,” he explains. “But it is not earnest and over-serious and preachy, it is incandescent and disruptive. But it gives Benjamin some substance that makes him different from the Black Keys.” But for Booker, the predominant force is music – whether it is black or white, punk or country blues, and a musician’s right to mingle them all together if she or he sees fit. I ask him what the most preposterous potential blues hybrid might be and he thinks for a moment then laughs down the line. “Blues and EDM, maybe?” he says. “I don’t even want to think about that … But that might be cool, you never know – it might even get EDM kids listening to the blues.” DD Dumbo’s Tropical Oceans EP is out now on 4AD. Benjamin Booker’s self-titled debut album is out now on Rough Trade. Rag’N’Bone man’s album Wolves is out now digitally on Columbia and via Bandcamp.",profile/laurabarton,Laura,Barton

Julie-Anne Corr Johnston is a glaring contrast to the old stereotypes about Northern Ireland loyalists. But the 27-year-old still belongs to a political party that evolved out of the Ulster Volunteer Force and despite her social radicalism maintains she is vehemently pro-union. Just back from her eastern European honeymoon after marrying Kerry Johnston, the Progressive Unionist party councillor admits she made history when elected to City Hall in May. Representing working-class loyalists in Oldpark, one of the most deprived wards in Northern Ireland, Corr Johnston says local people have been fully supportive of her marriage. “There were a lot of great comments across social media and loads of emails of support. But the electorate were fully aware of my sexuality prior to the election.” Reflecting on her election, Corr Johnston says: “To be totally honest when I got elected I didn’t think ‘Oh I’m the first LGBT to be elected!’ … What really got me excited was that I’m a young, progressive loyalist who happens to be a woman in politics, which is something we rarely see here and that is what I am most proud of.” Some fellow unionists such as the Democratic Unionist party oppose equal rights for gay people, but Corr Johnston says she prefers to be “diplomatic” towards those politicians whom others in the local LGBT community accuse of blatant homophobia. “Many heads, many minds is my approach. We don’t have to think alike and nor do we. The Progressive Unionist party has an equality policy and inclusivity in practice. And that means inclusivity for Peter and Paul in society rather than robbing one to pay the other. The DUP is a political party with a religious ethos and there is room for that in society.” Asked if the DUP were as diplomatic with her as she is with them, she replies: “No, no problems with them, in fact we get on extremely well and when we need to work together we do.” The DUP is currently trying to force a freedom of conscience bill through the Northern Ireland assembly, which effectively would allow born-again evangelical Christians to opt out of equality laws. It was prompted by the Equality Commission in the region finding a local bakery chain, Ashers, guilty of anti-gay discrimination for refusing to make a gay-themed cake for an LGBT couple. Corr Johnston says she would vote against any motion on the council that would back the DUP’s campaign. “Yes I would be opposed, that would be my personal viewpoint. The freedom of conscience bill only gives way for further discrimination.” While socially liberal and diametrically opposed to the DUP’s anti-abortion, anti-gay rights agenda, Corr Johnston insists she is like those in other unionist parties “rock solidly pro-union”. She says: “The United Kingdom? You don’t get a more liberal, progressive democracy in this world. And I am confident of Northern Ireland’s position within the UK. Our best interests are served being inside that union.” The PUP councillor says she became politicised by taking part in the grassroots loyalist protests against Belfast city council’s decision two years ago to reduce the number of days it flies the union flag. She also fully supports the right of North Belfast Orangemen to complete a controversial parade banned since July 2013 from passing the republican Ardoyne district close to where she grew up. “I was a flag protester at the time and that is what brought me to politics and political activism.” Corr Johnston says another main reason why she chose to join the PUP was its pro-choice stance on abortion. “I support the Marie Stopes clinic and women’s right to access services in it in Belfast. The party is pro-choice, that is why I joined.” The Ashers bakery controversy, the freedom of conscience bill and the fact that Northern Ireland remains the only part of the UK where Corr Johnston’s marriage is not on a fully equal footing suggest the region is still a hotbed of homophobia. But she believes the people are ahead of most of their politicians. She welcomes the fact the Republic of Ireland is holding a referendum in the spring to make gay marriage equal in law. “It is potentially what we might have to do here in Northern Ireland, and let the people speak. “When I was in Egypt recently with Kerry we both had to hide our sexuality whereas in Northern Ireland we have come a long way with LGBT issues. Some in the media would have you believe we are behind the times but think of the thousands of citizens who turn out in this city every year to cheer on the Gay Pride marchers. It’s evidence that people out there are more tolerant.” • This article was amended on 2 January 2015.

It was me and my daughter and my son, my wife and my daughter’s partner. We were trying to make the most of it. Obviously our minds were full of other things. You do the things you do. You have the turkey dinner and exchange presents, but it was very sombre. I just went to my bed on Christmas night about 10pm. I wasn’t really in the mood. I found out [about City Link going into administration] on Christmas Eve, just about lunchtime. I got a call from the RMT [Ward is the local representative for the RMT trade union]. I was down in Ayr delivering parcels to my customers as I do every day. I then called my depot manager and it was denied. They were going around the office telling everybody: “Don’t worry about it, this is a load of nonsense.” I sent my daughter a text message because I was quite upset. And I said: “Don’t say anything until it is 100% confirmed.” And she was working next to people who were talking about Christmas and what they were doing and she knew. They were all in with their Christmas hats and jumpers and she knew: I’ve got some horrible news and I can’t tell you. I had kiddies’ Christmas presents in the van so for the sake of them I carried on. I had medical goods in the van, we deliver a lot of medical supplies to people who have quite serious illnesses. And you can’t just say you are not getting them. I had bikes in the back of the van and other toys. There is no point in spoiling Christmas for other people.    RMT Union rep Mick Ward Photograph: Mark Sutherland/HEMEDIA   On New Year’s Eve I got it confirmed that talks had broken down and we were going to be made redundant. How did I feel? Just deflated. I spoke to my wife, spoke to my daughter, had a coffee and went to my bed. But I couldn’t sleep. I’ve never been so angry about anything in my life. I’m normally a mild-mannered person, but this has made my blood boil. I am hopeful I can get something else but I don’t know. It would be great if the three of us and my colleagues in Motherwell could get something. But who knows. The economic climate in Lanarkshire isn’t too good. To make matters worse my wife is an agency worker for another company and she got laid off on Christmas Eve as well. She works with a food production company. She is waiting by the phone. They said stand by your phone and you might get a call in the new year. Mick Ward is a driver at the City Link depot at Motherwell, where his son is a forklift driver, and his daughter is a call centre manager for City Link at Cambuslang, near Glasgow. They have 29 years’ combined service between them. He was speaking to Jennifer Rankin ",,,
120,2015-01-01T18:51:01Z,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/01/mothers-work-children-school-survey,Over 50% of mothers take time out from work when children start school,lifeandstyle,Life and style,The Guardian,"Working mothers face almost constant disruption to their careers which can continue up to retirement, with many women still choosing to go part-time or stop work altogether to accommodate the needs of their children, a survey by the Guardian and Netmums has found. The survey of 2,500 women found that mothers who returned from work after maternity leave often chose to leave again when their children began school, with more than half saying they decided to give up work, go part-time or start working from home when their children reached primary school age. Nearly two thirds – 60% – of respondents said they had put their careers on hold because they wanted to be at home to help their children with homework and support them over issues arising from their school day. More than one in four added that schools made so many demands, from classes that teach parents how to help with homework to requests for support on school trips, that it became impossible to work full-time. Charlotte Munday gave up her full-time job as the business manager for international sales at BMW in London for a part-time job near her home in Surrey when her eldest daughter, Jessica, began school in September. “I was surprised by how much more Jessica needed me when she got to school,” said Harris. “She needed me far more than when she was at nursery, when she just needed a cuddle from someone she loved. Now she runs to me at the school gate to tell me about her day: minor things to anyone else, but to her the centre of her universe is collapsing. If I didn’t come home until hours later, she would have to deal with all that intense emotion on her own. “Another reason I went part-time is because the world is so much more competitive now,” she added. “I want to make sure Jessica is doing her homework, learning to enjoy learning and reading, and getting every opportunity to do after-school classes.” Respondents said they spend considerable time during the day planning how to give their children creative help with homework, closely supervising after-school activities, joining the PTA and helping out in the classroom. The survey also found that mothers in particular are likely to find their careers repeatedly coming into conflict with the needs of their children, and that this disruption can continue when children reach secondary school, with teenagers needing as much support outside of school hours as younger children. Siobhan Freegard, co-founder of Netmums, said the needs of young teenagers often takes parents by surprise: “The truth is that the older your children get, the more they need you emotionally. Once they get to secondary school, they also need a great deal of help to organise all the homework and other academic demands they’re suddenly faced with.” Those surveyed admitted feeling uncomfortable with their choice to give up work with 60% saying they feel embarrassed by the expectation that parents will work more, not less, when their child reaches school-age. Almost 40% said they are made to feel they are “setting a poor example to their child” by not working. Just 20% said they felt their choice meant they were seen as a better parent. Freegard said: “Mothers - and it usually is mothers - have been trying and failing to talk about this issue for ages. It’s a hidden topic.” But it is not just parents who are taken by surprise by the intensity of the needs of their growing children. According to Scarlet Harris, Women’s Equality Officer at the TUC, employers often have preconceptions that women in their 50s have finished their child-rearing and, as a result, can be unsympathetic to requests for flexible working or other accommodations relating to childcare needs. “There’s a lot of focus on childcare in the very early years but the assumption is that this goes away when the children get to school,” said Harris, author of the recent Women Over 50 In The Workplace report. “But given that ONS figures show that nearly half of all births in 2013 were to mothers aged 30 and above, and one in 25 babies is born to a mother over the age of 40, it is perhaps less surprising that women in their early 50s are still caring for their children,” she said.",profile/ameliahill,Amelia,Hill
121,2015-01-01T19:00:02Z,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/01/ed-balls-george-osborne-labour,George Osborne is at the margins – Labour is the centre ground,commentisfree,Opinion,The Guardian,"There are moments in politics when, amid the fog of accusation and rebuttal, things suddenly become crystal clear. I remember well the speech in summer 2000 when the shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo, set out Conservative plans to cut public spending to fund tax cuts – the moment we knew they had lost the 2001 election. Or the day in September 2007, walking through Leeds city centre, when I saw a long queue of people waiting outside Northern Rock to take out their money – and knew the global financial crisis had become real for working people. It’s now clear that last month’s autumn statement was another of those defining moments – the day the chancellor, George Osborne, ceded the political centre ground to Labour. In the runup to the autumn statement, we all knew the ongoing squeeze on living standards was leading to a huge shortfall in tax revenues, throwing deficit reduction plans badly off track. What took everyone by surprise was that, in the face of forecasts that this loss of tax revenues would continue, Osborne would choose to make up the shortfall with massively deeper spending cuts in the next parliament. While he lashed out at the BBC for reporting the facts, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said these plans would mean “colossal cuts” to public services and the Office for Budget Responsibility concluded they would take public spending as a share of GDP back to 1930s levels. That morning, in the Today programme studio, Jim Naughtie asked whether Labour would match these cuts. I think he expected me to qualify my response. And Ican clearly remember his look of surprise when I replied “absolutely not”. Let me be clear, including to those who would wish it were not so: Labour will need to cut public spending in the next parliament to balance the books. But Ed Miliband and I do not believe a 35% state can be sustained without causing huge damage to our NHS, policing, defence, local services and economic infrastructure. Osborne’s increasingly extreme and ideological approach goes far beyond the necessary task of deficit reduction. It is a risky second-term Conservative project to shrink the state – a lurch to the right which has left Labour as the centre-ground alternative. So the economic choice at the election is now stark and clear. Do we adopt a Labour plan to change our economy, so that it works for working people again and to get the deficit down in a tough and balanced way? Or do we carry on with the same failed Tory policies and slash public services to a level of national income last seen in the 1930s? This choice is not about whether to get the deficit down. All the main parties are committed to balancing the books in the next parliament – whatever the smears from David Cameron. But only Labour has a plan which is tough and deliverable, balanced and fair. We will cut the deficit every year, and get the current budget into surplus – and national debt falling – as soon as possible in the next parliament. But we will take a different approach to the Tories. We will reverse the £3bn a year tax cut the Tories and Lib Dems have given the top 1% of earners, and put saving our NHS at the heart of Labour’s first budget with our plan to raise an extra £2.5bn a year. We will also scrap the winter fuel allowance for the richest pensioners and cap child benefit rises at 1%. Our review of every pound spent by government is finding savings that can be made in order to better protect frontline services, including £250m in policing and over half a billion in local government. And in the coming weeks my shadow cabinet colleagues will set out further details of the savings they have identified and the reforms they will make. But only an economic plan that has rising living standards for all at its heart will deliver the tax revenues that are essential for getting the deficit down in a fair way. That’s why Labour’s plan to change our economy – including raising the minimum wage, increasing apprenticeships, getting more homes built and reforming the banks – is a vital part of our plan to balance the books. Osborne and David Cameron say the election will be about economic competence. But there is nothing competent about borrowing over £200bn more than planned because of your failure to deliver a recovery that is felt by all working people and not just a few at the top. It is Osborne who now faces a credibility problem. His original strategy – to balance the books by this year and go into the election having delivered tax cuts – lies in tatters. Instead he has gambled on people supporting a dramatic shrinking of the state and a £7bn promise of unfunded tax cuts which could be paid for only by another VAT rise or even deeper cuts to public services – or both. In contrast, Labour is now the only main political party that has not made any unfunded tax or spending commitments. At the start of 2015, we face the most important general election of my adult lifetime. I relish the debate to come. Because I don’t believe the British people will let Osborne gamble with our future.​",profile/edballs,Ed ,Balls
122,2015-01-01T19:00:02Z,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jan/01/ed-balls-political-centre-ground-labour,Ed Balls moves to claim political centre ground for Labour,politics,Politics,The Guardian,"Ed Balls has moved to claim the centre ground in British politics, in a rebuttal to critics who claim that Labour has swung too far to the left to win this year’s general election. In a strongly worded article for the Guardian, setting out the battle lines for the coming weeks, the shadow chancellor writes that he would continue to cut the deficit if elected, but that the Tories have lurched to the right under a chancellor who is happy to move towards a shrunken, “35% state”. Balls’s use of the phrase “centre ground” comes only days after Tony Blair used the same expression in an interview with the Economist, which was widely interpreted as a criticism of Ed Miliband for moving to the left. His article will be seen as a rejection of Blair’s criticisms and other internal party critics. But it also demonstrates Balls’s conviction that Osborne has allowed himself and David Cameron to be portrayed as extremists by pressing ahead with public spending cuts. In the article, Balls writes that last month’s autumn statement was a pivotal point in the fortunes of Osborne. “There are moments in politics when, amid the fog of accusation and rebuttal, things suddenly become crystal clear. “And it’s now clear that last month’s autumn statement was another of those rare defining moments – the day Chancellor George Osborne ceded the political centre ground to Labour,” Balls writes. Osborne had an opportunity to change policies, but instead has persisted in cuts which will see tax revenues continue to contract, Balls says. He writes: “In the runup to the autumn statement we all knew the ongoing squeeze on living standards was leading to a huge shortfall in tax revenues, throwing deficit reduction plans badly off track. “What took everyone by surprise was that, in the face of forecasts that this loss of tax revenues would continue, Chancellor Osborne would choose to make up the shortfall with massively deeper spending cuts in the next parliament.” Keen to emphasise that Labour will continue to cut public spending, Balls says the party will balance the books. However, he adds that the cuts planned by the chancellor will damage the health service and are driven by ideology, not necessity. “Let me be clear, including to those who would wish it were not so: Labour will need to cut public spending in the next parliament to balance the books. But Ed Miliband and I do not believe a 35% state can be sustained year after year without causing huge damage to our National Health Service, policing, defence, local services and our economic infrastructure. ”George Osborne’s increasingly extreme and ideological approach goes far beyond the necessary task of deficit reduction. It is a risky second-term Conservative project to shrink the state – a lurch to the right which has left Labour as the centre-ground alternative,” he writes. Last month, Osborne set out dramatic plans to move Britain from the red into the black that will see public spending as a percentage of GDP fall to its lowest level since the 1930s. The plans, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), presume the loss of a further 1m public sector jobs by 2020, a renewed public sector pay squeeze and a further freeze on tax credits. The OBR, in its analysis of the autumn statement, said that cuts after 2015 would see the total level of public spending fall to 35.2% of GDP in 2019-20, its lowest level in 80 years. In the days after the autumn statement, Osborne was widely seen as having been rattled by criticisms of his plans. He accused the BBC of hyperbolic coverage and conjuring up bogus images of the 1930s depression. He was then drawn into a confrontation with Britain’s leading tax and spending experts after the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said he had a duty to spell out his deficit reduction plans and warned of cuts on a “colossal” scale. Balls, who is still trailing Osborne on personal economic credibility, has been emboldened by the IFS and the OBR. Blair told the Economist earlier this week that he was “convinced the Labour party succeeds best when it is in the centre ground”. Stressing the importance of Labour “not alienating large parts of business, for one thing”, he added: “I am still very much New Labour and Ed would not describe himself in that way, so there is obviously a difference there.” He added that May’s poll could become one “in which a traditional leftwing party competes with a traditional rightwing party, with the traditional result”. Asked if this meant a Tory win, he replied: “Yes, that is what happens.” After reports claiming his words were a criticism of Miliband, Blair said he expected a Labour victory and had been misinterpreted.",profile/rajeev-syal,Rajeev,Syal

Driverless cars are to be tested in all those locations in trials that will put the UK at the forefront of automated vehicle technology. Government funding of £19m will allow three separate trials to take place: one in Bristol, one in Greenwich and one split between Coventry and Milton Keynes. The trials, lasting from 18 to 36 months, will test different aspects of self-driving technology. All will take place away from public roads, though each is aimed at making automated vehicles on Britain’s roads a reality. The trials will use semi-autonomous cars that can drive themselves for periods of the time with a human driver behind the wheel, as well as lightweight self-driving pods designed for low-speed shuttle services. The three projects will be linked by an external monitor who will coordinate all the data.    A Google prototype driverless car. Photograph: Google   “We’re looking to start our first trial with automated shuttles with members of the public in May,” said Dr Nick Reed from the Transport Research Lab (TRL), leader of the consortium running the Greenwich trials. He added: “You’ve got the cream of UK transport organisations distilled into these three projects and each with its own twist on what should be tested.” The Greenwich trials – named the Gateway project – will involve self-driving shuttles being tested on closed roads and in simulation facilities. The project is led by the TRL with contributions from the Royal College of Art, Imperial College London and the University of Greenwich along with General Motors, the AA and RAC. “These shuttles are a relatively mature technology, so our trials will be more about how to manage participants and the vehicles, to get us towards these vehicles being a real proposition for public roads,” Reed said. Gateway will also test cars that can drop off passengers then park themselves. The vehicles will then return on command, similar to concepts shown off by Audi and other carmakers. The Bristol trials – named the Venturer project – will involve tests investigating legal and insurance issues, as well as public reaction to self-driving cars. The Venturer project will be led by project management group Atkins Highways & Transportation. Also involved will be the Bristol robotics lab at the University of Bristol and insurance company Axa.    Driverless vehicles could change the way we move around cities. Photograph: Alamy   The question of who pays in the event of a crash involving a driverless car is seen as one of the major barriers to letting self-driving cars loose on highways. “This programme will help keep the UK at the forefront of this transformational technology, helping to deepen our understanding of the impact on road users and wider society and open up new opportunities for our economy and society,” said Lee Woodcock of Atkins. The trials in Milton Keynes and Coventry will be run by a consortium named UK Autodrive. Arup is to lead this project with Jaguar Land Rover and Ford contributing. The project will focus on car-to-car and car-to-road communication and the infrastructure required. “Our plan with the practical demonstration phases is to start testing with single vehicles on closed roads, and to build up to a point where all road users, as well as legislators, the police and insurance companies, are confident about how driverless pods and fully and partially autonomous cars can operate safely on UK roads,” said Tim Armitage, UK Autodrive project director for Arup. The government has made clear its support of the automated vehicle industry. “The UK is a world leader in the development of driverless technology,” said business secretary Vince Cable. “This not only puts us at the forefront of this transformational technology but also opens up new opportunities for our economy and society.” Cable said the Department for Transport (DfT) would look at the legislation needed to conduct trials on public roads, like those taking place in California and Nevada by Google and others. Funding for driverless car development was announced last July, when Cable promised to invest £10m. A further £9m in funding was announced in George Osborne’s autumn statement. Transport minister Claire Perry said at the time of Cable’s announcement: “Driverless cars have huge potential to transform the UK’s transport network – they could improve safety, reduce congestion and lower emissions, particularly CO2. We’re determined to ensure driverless cars can fulfil this potential which is why we’re actively reviewing regulatory obstacles to create the right framework for trialling these vehicles on UK roads.” But others have warned of the need for caution. “Automated electric vehicles have the potential to change driving patterns because drivers won’t have to slavishly devote their time to controlling a vehicle,” said Dr Gregory Offer from the department of mechanical engineering at Imperial College London. “However, unless governments plan effectively, the potential positive impact of automated vehicles could turn into a negative.”",profile/samuel-gibbs,Samuel,Gibbs

As arts organisations enter 2015 fearing further austerity, whether from local government or whatever the new national government is, John Kampfner acknowledged that they should be “very scared”. But in an interview with the Guardian he added: “We should also be incredibly robust and incredibly confident in ourselves. You won’t get anywhere by moaning, so we might as well start doing.” Kampfner is chief executive of a new UK body, which launched in November – a CBI for the arts and creative industries set up to provide a unified voice for a sector so dizzyingly diverse it has lacked the ability to deliver a single, strong punch. Kampfner said the key aim was to bring together the public arts, creative industries companies and cultural education bodies in a triangle – because they are all intrinsically linked.    John Kampfner is chief executive of the Creative Industries Foundation, set up to provide a unified voice for a sector so dizzyingly diverse it has lacked the ability to deliver a single, strong punch. Photograph: David Levene/Guardian   “We are at a fantastic moment with our arts and creative industries. You can roll off the amazing art galleries, museums around the country, amazing TV programmes that sell around the world, films, music, fashion, design, architecture. There is barely a sector that isn’t a world beater at the moment. “And yet we are at an incredibly dangerous moment. We are at a dangerous moment for public funding, a dangerous moment for creative education at schools and universities and we are at a potentially dangerous moment for our commercial companies because if we fail to think long term, if we fail to invest in our public spaces and cultural education, the talent pool that has projected us on to this level of the past 10 or 20 years will dry up. “We need to be thinking long term. Our corporate CEOs in the film industry, in the fashion industry, need to be thinking not just how is our bottom line looking – how much have we sold, but also what is the state of our public arts and public education to fuel the next generation. If they don’t do that the bottom line in 10, 15, 20 years’ time will be shot.” The federation is the brainchild of the designer Sir John Sorrell. In 2013, he met with nine other senior industry figures, including Darren Henley, the managing director of Classic FM recently put in charge of Arts Council England, Amanda Nevill, chief executive of the BFI, Sir Nicholas Serota, director of Tate, and Nigel Carrington, vice chancellor of the University of the Arts. The mission was to join up public arts, commercial creative companies and universities, education and skills “in a way that has never been done,” said Kampfner. “To say: you can’t simply look after your own. If you do, then short term you might be fine and long term you won’t be.” Kampfner, a former editor of the New Statesman and until 2012 chief executive of Index on Censorship, was brought on board in the summer of 2013, and in March the following year he walked on to the admin floor of Central St Martins in London to find a desk waiting for him. The federation was up and running. The next few months was all about getting a few staff and, principally, federation members, whether that was Warner Brothers or arts organisations such as the Yorkshire Sculpture Park and the V&A. “We expected we would have 100 companies by the end of the year. By the time we got to well over 200 we thought, crikey, we need to launch earlier than planned.” The formal launch came on 24 November. Hundreds jammed into Central St Martins to hear a line up of speakers that included George Osborne, Harriet Harman and Danny Alexander as well as Anish Kapoor and Paul Greengrass. “I was hoping to get Ed Sheeran and David Tennant as well … we’d put out a few feelers. Maybe that’s for another time.” The speech by Osborne, probably the most genuine arts enthusiast in the cabinet, was particularly striking. Yes he talked about the economic case for the arts but, Kampfner said, “then he stopped and said that was not why he was there. He wanted to talk about why the arts and creative industries make Britain what it is.” Kampfner said the UK’s creative industries, from theatre to gaming, were world leaders. “We are in danger of throwing our success away just as other nations are embracing the arts and the creative industries. Many arts organisations have been hit hard by funding cuts, both nationally and locally, and the most immediate threat for many is the prospect of more local authority cuts. Kampfner is chair of Turner Contemporary in Margate and said he had direct experience of how the arts benefit towns and regions economically and spiritually. “Turner Contemporary has risen from a car park with weeds into one of the most important galleries in this country and is vital to the town and the region.” The same could be said for the Baltic in Gateshead or the Hepworth in Wakefield. “It is entirely myopic of local authorities and government to cut public funding much more,” said Kampfner. He acknowledged there were hard choices, “but I say to Kent county council, and they get it, that every pound you invest in Turner Contemporary has brought you huge amounts of measurable public good.” Arts organisations are becoming more entrepreneurial and better at raising private money, but Kampfner believes the government, which has been evangelical in its calls for greater philanthropy, should have done more to make it happen. “One of the confusions I have with this government is, if there is a view that the private pound is as good as the public pound then why is still so difficult to give in this country in terms of philanthropy and the tax system? We see how many wealthy people there are in this country and the proportion of private giving to the arts is miniscule compared with other countries. “It is partly a cultural thing, it is partly a laziness thing … but it is also a fiscal and governmental thing.” Kampfner is still based on the admin floor of Central St Martins, but he has now six small desks in the corner with a handful of staff in front of computer screens. It is still a new organisation and the tiny staff call themselves the vaguely Star Trek sounding Federation – “it was taking too long to answer the phone with Creative Industries Federation,” said Kampfner. Three more staff are due to be taken on in the new year, but the most immediate project is a two-month consultation process from which firm policy proposals will be formed, ready to be presented to the incoming government. “In adversity you have to equip yourself, you have to arm yourself, you have to find new ways to be resilient ... we are not in any way minimising the challenges. “We need to protect public arts and its funding,” said Kampfner, “and we need to equip ourselves for a new reality, which is bringing public and private together.”",profile/markbrown,Mark,Brown

The thermometer at Los Angeles International airport hit 36F (2C) on Thursday, beating the old record of 38F, set in 1972. Ice formed in nearby swimming pools. Freezing temperatures overnight dumped heavy snow on mountains and foothills around the LA basin, producing picture-postcard scenes in places but problems for citrus farmers and homeless people. Marching bands and people on the flower-covered floats which parade through Pasadena before the annual Rose Bowl football game – this year Florida State versus Oregon – braced for potentially the coldest parade on record. Rough seas driven by strong winds claimed the lives of two men off Santa Catalina island, where boats in Avalon harbour washed ashore. Timothy Mitchell, 39, a Harbor Patrol officer who attempted to secure the boats, was crushed between a vessel and rocks on Tuesday. Police recovered the body of another man who was named as Bruce Ryder, 53. The cold snap toppled trees in northern California, killing two people in the town of Paradise as well as a woman in Redding who was struck when a pine crashed through her home. Authorities in Sacramento, Elk Grove and other cities opened “warming centers” for people needing refuge from the cold. They offer shelter, blankets and snacks. Icy conditions in Riverside stranded dozens of motorists who found it too difficult to drive on the highway. The California Highway Patrol said up to 200 vehicles in Big Bear, a ski resort, were towed after getting stuck in snow. The National Weather Service issued a freeze warning starting at midnight on Wednesday and continuing until noon on Friday, when temperatures were expected to begin returning to normal. Citrus farmers said they would use water, heat and wind machines and take other protective measures to protect their crops. A three-year drought had left some without water. Thousands of people with scarves, jackets, blankets and flasks braved the cold to line Pasadena’s streets for the 126th Rose Parade, a five-and-a-half mile procession that marks California’s start to the new year. The weather service recorded temperatures of 36F and said Pasadena may break its 1952 record low of 32F (0C). As temperatures dropped on Tuesday a group of organisers known as Petal Pushers blew on carnations and other flowers to coax them to open in time for the parade. On Wednesday a freak wind weather officials termed a “cold dust devil” sliced through booths and hurled equipment, prompting people, including one in a cow costume, to scramble for cover. Four people were slightly injured. As the parade preparted to get under way on Thursday, some people lining the route danced and did exercises to stay warm. The Los Angeles Time quoted one bystander who found it over the top: “This is Boston on a warm day, wimps.” ",profile/rorycarroll,Carroll,Rory

Even unlikely. A side who pride themselves on an ability to ally thrilling attacking play with stingy defence were picked apart and embarrassed across the capital, wilting in the face of Tottenham Hotspur’s eager energy and attacking threat, and eclipsed by a homegrown forward who has never played better. Memories of this riotous occasion will sustain Harry Kane through the winter. The England Under-21 international scored twice, earned a penalty and supplied Nacer Chadli with the hosts’ fifth as the majority in this arena revelled in a victory that felt barely credible. José Mourinho’s teams are not thrashed in this way. Never before had he conceded four while in charge of Chelsea, and this was only the second time in a 14-year managerial career the Portuguese had watched powerless as his charges shipped five. The new year has already seen their lead at the top shredded. Manchester City boast an identical record at present courtesy of a winning goal plundered by Frank Lampard up at the Etihad stadium earlier in the day. Those at the top are separated only on alphabetical order. The race has another twist to digest. Perhaps fatigue played its part, with this a third awkward away trip in four matches in a congested period, but frailties which had not previously been apparent were exposed too often across Chelsea’s back line for comfort. Spurs may have been clinical, but the visitors were brittle and all the complaints about the non-award of a penalty when Oscar prodded a ball against the grounded Jan Vertonghen’s arm smacked of deflection tactics. There were real deficiencies here to spark concern, rather than conspiracy theories to expose. Nemanja Matic was unable to stamp his usual authority on this contest. Gary Cahill has quelled the threat of Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez at times during his career, but Kane left him dazed and confused. The centre-half’s frustration erupted when the ball was stuck under the forward’s body on the touchline late on, the kicks to the back and calf apparently not noticed by the referee, Phil Dowd. The Football Association may choose to scrutinise that incident more carefully in the days ahead. In truth, the entire Chelsea defence appeared flustered and uncharacteristically vulnerable, disconcerted by the aggressive running of Chadli and Andros Townsend down the flanks but, most of all, by Kane’s excellence. The forward is improving with every outing, his display here the best of a fledgling career to date from the moment he collected on the left and cut in-field with Oscar hesitant. Free of a challenge, the striker merely skimmed a shot into the corner from 20 yards and, instantly, the hosts’ conviction was stoked.    Tottenham Hotspur’s Harry Kane celebrates his equaliser. Photograph: KIERAN GALVIN/EPA   Tottenham were rampant in what little time remained up until the interval, Christian Eriksen scuttling forward to liberate Chadli behind Cahill. Thibaut Courtois charged to the edge of his area to intercept but his compatriot’s shot was poked beyond the goalkeeper and on to the far post, with Danny Rose bravely belting in the rebound to record a first league goal here since a derby winner on debut against Arsenal in April 2010. He was bruised while converting, though not as wounded as the visitors. Chelsea were still wheezing in disbelief when Cahill upended Kane as the striker appeared on his blindside. Townsend, the third youth-team graduate turned goalscorer, thumped in the resultant penalty. Mourinho attempted to wrest back some control by introducing Ramires at the interval but his team’s rearguard were shellshocked. When Chadli pinned back Branislav Ivanovic and shifted possession inside to Kane, the young English forward turned Matic far too easily and curled a fourth through John Terry’s legs with Courtois helpless. The fifth, converted by Chadli, also flicked off the centre-half. “Chelsea are one of the best in the world, at Real Madrid level,” offered Mauricio Pochettino. This was the first time in eight attempts that he has beaten a Mourinho team. “A great victory. We deserved the victory. We were better than Chelsea.”   Related: José Mourinho fumes at ref Phil Dowd and says Eden Hazard is unprotected   They were still anxious at times, particularly in the period after Diego Costa had pilfered an early lead. Eden Hazard had collected Courtois’ 60-yard throw, retained his balance under Rose’s challenge and struck the far post with a shot. Costa dangled a leg at that effort from an offside position but Oscar collected at the far post and, when he fired back across the diving Hugo Lloris, the forward poked in legitimately from close-range. The visitors’ other rewards were plucked from a game of catch-up, Hazard skipping forward to exchange passes with Cesc Fàbregas to make it 4-2 and Terry tapping home the Belgian’s cross for 5-3. A thrill in the attacking play was retained, but this was a performance undermined by slackness at the other end. The advantage at the top is no more, with only one win secured in five away games.

127,2015-01-01T20:16:00Z,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jan/02/prison-songs-berrimah-hilton,Prison Songs: 'Welcome to the Berrimah Hilton – prepare to be amazed',tv-and-radio,Television & radio,The Guardian,"An SBS musical documentary has taken an unprecedented look inside a Northern Territory prison to reveal the dark, sometimes tragic histories of its inmates – and their day-to-day lives. It took more than two years of negotiations with the NT corrections department for the film-makers to gain access to Darwin’s Berrimah prison. A previous attempt to shoot in Western Australia resulted in the government flatly refusing access to any of its facilities. Film-makers held auditions at Berrimah and a few dozen inmates lined up to tell their stories, hopeful of appearing in the documentary to share their feelings and experiences through blues, hip-hop, reggae and gospel. Berrimah, the Northern Territory’s largest prison, opened in 1973 with 116 inmates. Over the decades that number increased to about 800 with men and women housed separately. More than eight in 10 inmates at the prison are Indigenous and data shows that half will return to prison. Prisoners have endured chronic overcrowding in the centre which has reached up to 130% capacity at times. Shellie Morris, an Indigenous singer-songwriter and Australian of the year nominee whose original music features in the show, said the crew had to navigate not just the initial access to the facility, but working around inmate programs, routines and liaison officers. “It taught us to be patient,” she told Guardian Australia. The crew built up trust with those who eventually participated in the show. “We told them: there are going to be cameras in your face, we’ll be looking right into your life,” said Jone Vuqe, production assistant and Indigenous consultant for the film. “We had to be honest.” The creators sought to highlight the issues around incarceration – particularly of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people – and to show the real people behind the statistics, while staying aware of the victims of the crimes that put some of these people behind bars.    Max and Dale, who collaborated on hip-hop song The Middle. Photograph: SBS   The film features a number of male and female prisoners, each with their own past. Common themes emerged linking the tales – family violence, drugs and alcohol. While the songs were written by Morris and Casey Bennetto – the award-winning composer of Keating: The Musical – the lyrics came from participants’ own words and they had final approval. “It was really important with the sensitivity of people’s life stories that they had absolute control over what the Australian public and the world would see,” said Morris. Max and Dale, both 27, rewrote the lyrics for the hip-hop track The Middle which described feeling stuck between two worlds as light-skinned Aboriginal men. Phil, a 53-year-old Berrimah inmate, has spent more than half his life inside. In Prison Songs, he speaks of how hard it was to get a job with a criminal record when he got out, and of young guys around him getting on drugs including ice. Phil took his first hit of heroin on the day his father died, and says being in jail keeps him straight.     Phil in Prison Songs SBS. Photograph: SBS   “It’s like this is my home,” he tells the camera.  “When I get out I miss this place … When I’m in here I’m straight, I get my health back, I’m alive … When I’m out on the streets I’m running around fucking getting mixed up in crime and shooting drugs. Once I have that first shot I’m fucked. It’s nonstop. I get in too deep. The place that saved me is this Berrimah Hilton.” Phil is not a singer but Morris and Bennetto wanted to keep his voice in the film somehow. They latched on to the moniker he had given the prison – the Berrimah Hilton – and created a cheesy commercial, complete with female prisoners as backup singers and dancers. “Is this your first time at the Berrimah Hilton?” a smiling Phil asks the camera. “Prepare to be amazed. Checking in is all to easy.” The tongue-in-cheek take was very much a part of Indigenous humour, said Morris. “We live in so much trauma at times that sometimes all you can do is laugh.”  She added that she didn’t know if people would be affronted by the humour in such a dark topic, but that Phil laughed when he first saw the finished video. Some of the female prisoners had asked her if it was a “happy film”.  “I said there is enough tragedy in this film to last a lifetime, we’re just having some light moments.” In November, the prison population of Berrimah began moving to a new facility at Holtze after years of additions and extensions to keep pace with the increasing incarceration rates. The old Berrimah prison, where Prison Songs was filmed, will be renovated to house juvenile detainees from Don Dale. • Prison Songs is on SBS1 at 9.30pm on Sunday, 4 January",profile/helen-davidson,Helen,Davidson
128,2015-01-01T20:27:03Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/01/frank-lampard-manchester-city-next-season-manuel-pellegrini-mls-new-york-city,Manuel Pellegrini hints Frank Lampard could stay at City next season,football,Football,The Guardian,"Manuel Pellegrini has suggested Frank Lampard could extend his stay at Manchester City beyond this season after the player’s precise status with the Premier League champions was thrown into confusion and he came under fire from supporters of New York City “outraged” by his decision not to join the Major League Soccer club, as agreed, in the new year. Lampard, who scored a 73rd-minute winner in City’s 3-2 victory over Sunderland on Thursday, had initially been set to join NYC after 31 December when it was believed his loan contract at the Etihad Stadium expired. However, it has emerged that Lampard has never been on loan at City from NYC but instead signed a deal that extended beyond New Year’s Eve. The champions had to have the existing terms amended to have a break clause removed and were granted permission to do so by the Premier League on Wednesday. As no player can be registered to two clubs at the same time Lampard is officially on City’s books. He may possibly have signed a pre-contract agreement or agreed terms with City Football Group, the parent company of both clubs. After the win against Sunderland, Pellegrini was forced to defend City from angry criticism directed by NYC’s independent supporters group, the Third Rail. He said: “That is why every time you ask me about Frank Lampard during December, I repeat once again we are trying to keep Frank but it is not easy because others are involved in this situation. “Maybe all the New York fans, and I understand perfectly, want to see Frank playing because for the fans in New York to see Frank play is an amazing thing. I hope that he will be there next year but I think that in this moment the best decision for him, for the club, for New York is to stay here with us.” When pressed why he had said only “hope” regarding Lampard playing at NYC next season, Pellegrini refused to clarify that the midfielder would definitely do so. Pellegrini said: “You are talking May or June? You cannot have all different questions about Frank Lampard. He will stay now with us until the end of the season. In May maybe you can start thinking about what will happen in the future. He will stay with us until May.” Asked if there was any chance Lampard could move to NYC before the end of the season, Pellegrini added: “No. When you asked me before we qualified for the Champions League if there is some link between the situations, I always said no and Frank knows exactly what I think about that. He will stay here until the end of the season, no problems about that.” The statement from the Third Rail said: “Many fans, including our members, decided to support the team, committed to season tickets and bought merchandise under the impression that Frank Lampard would be playing for New York City Football Club, not Manchester City. Many of those fans are rightly outraged by this decision.” The Sunderland manager, Gus Poyet, had no issue with Lampard being available to play for City against his team. “For me it’s clever, it’s smart. It’s legal, so I’ve got no problem with that,” he said. For the second match in a row City ceded a two-goal lead, after strikes from Yaya Touré and Stevan Jovetic were cancelled out by Jack Rodwell and Adam Johnson later in the second half before Lampard’s winner. Despite Pellegrini having only three frontline strikers in Jovetic, Sergio Agüero and Edin Dzeko, and the latter two currently being injured, he played down whether a fourth will be recruited in the transfer window. “I think we are not thinking about the window,” he said. “We have the option. We will see players we can bring or sell or go on loan but it is not our first important thing at this moment. We will see during January what will happen. So we have an option and we can use it until the end of the transfer window.” City have been linked with a move for Swansea City’s top scorer Wilfried Bony. “Every week I read and hear so many players come here to Manchester City,” said Pellegrini when asked about the forward. “I once again remind you that we have important restrictions about the amount of money and restrictions on players we can put in our Champions League squad [due to FFP sanctions]. So it’s difficult to bring in a player when he cannot play in Champions League, which is why I repeat we will see during January which is the best for our team.”",profile/jamiejackson,jackson,jamie

Is there a footballer having more of a ball anywhere in the world than Tottenham’s deliciously irrepressible centre-forward? Here is a player who simply keeps on refusing to find his level, to plateau out, to look down and feel the first little twinge after five months of vertiginous ascent from bit-part midweek man to the most impressive English centre-forward currently playing and one of the stories of the Premier League season so far. Victories against the league leaders are rare enough but this rollicking 5-3 defeat of a tired-looking Chelsea was a tonic in so many other ways. Not only did it leave Tottenham in fifth place, above Arsenal, this was a win that spoke to a wider clunking into gear of Mauricio Pochettino’s hard-running, hard-pressing methods, executed here by a team with five former youth team players in the starting XI. Chief among them was Kane, who played the role of goalscorer, folk hero and chief all-round inspirationalist, scoring twice with superbly executed right-foot daisy cutters, winning a penalty in between, setting up another for Nacer Chadli and generally leaving Gary Cahill scrabbling around White Hart Lane like a dazed city-centre reveller, comedy antlers askew, still wondering where the last night-bus home leaves from. From one nil up to 4-1 down in the space of 22 minutes either side of half time, Chelsea were not exactly mugged as overrun without warning by a Tottenham team that punished a little meekness, some limp closing down, some tiredness certainly. Before the adrenaline of chasing the game kicked in Chelsea did look unusually sluggish with Nemanja Matic and Cesc Fàbregas, the key axis of the season so far, made to squirm and scrabble at times. For all that, Chelsea took the lead deservedly after 18 minutes. Cutting in from the left Eden Hazard did not so much dribble past Danny Rose as avoid him like a piece of errant street furniture. His cross-shot was played back in by Oscar for Diego Costa to score from the edge of the six-yard box. There is a similarity of styles between Costa and Kane. Like Costa, Kane tries to have an impact on every part of the game, harrying defenders, dropping into midfield and still providing the point of the attack. Like Costa, he can score all kinds of goals given the opportunity, as he was on 30 minutes by Eden Hazard, who was beaten too easily by a drop of the shoulder as Kane shot hard and low into the corner. It was a wonderful goal from not very much and another example of how Kane has so often lifted Tottenham this season, a player stretching up towards the outer reaches of his talent and taking his team-mates with him. From those early Europa League goals at the tail end of the summer, the expectation has been that Kane would inevitably stop scoring. He has not. At some point a hot streak has to be allowed to solidify into something else, and right now he simply looks like a bold, skilful, physically imposing all-round striker of genuine class. He can shoot from distance, take free-kicks and score with his head. Beyond his rawness, not to mention the passing resemblance to a member of the Christmas Truce XI of 1914, right now it is hard to understand why Kane should have been so widely dismissed as a game but limited trier. With Wayne Rooney playing as a midfielder, deeper, there is no better English centre-forward at the moment. All things being equal, Kane must be a certainty for Roy Hodgson’s next senior England squad in March. Better still, he seems a happy player too, one to lift both team-mates and crowd, just as here Tottenham’s tyros continued to harry the league leaders. A minute before half-time it was the turn of Rose to score his first goal at White Hart Lane since his Premier League debut four and a half years ago. Moments later Kane drew a lunge from Cahill that became a trip inside the area. Another of those former youth team players, Andros Townsend, scored from the spot. The second half brought more of the same as Kane continued to run at Cahill mercilessly. His second goal and Tottenham’s fourth came after another neat jink, the ball zinged into the corner with little backlift. Hazard pulled one back on the hour and with 14 minutes left Cahill took a measure of revenge, twice kicking his chief tormentor in the small of the back as he lay by the touchline smothering the ball. It did not end well. Kane picked himself up, took the ball in the right channel, powered into the Chelsea box and squared for Chadli to make it five.",profile/barneyronay,Barney,Ronay

It will make a huge difference to daily life, said the Spanish-language newspaper La Opinion. “Without doubt it’s the immigrant community’s most anticipated law of 2015.” Eduardo Garcia, a Democratic assemblyman who represents Coachella valley, told the Desert Sun the move was a “major victory” for immigrants. “It’s exciting, certainly historic and a great thing for California,” he said. “Having properly trained, tested, licensed and insured drivers on our roads is not only important, it’s a priority.” Vehicle insurers said the law opened a new market. California has an estimated 2.5 million undocumented migrants, many of whom need to drive in order to live and work in sprawling cities with meagre public transport. Nine other states, including Nevada, Colorado and Illinois, grant licenses to undocumented people. Demand in California is expected to outstrip all the other states combined. California’s DMV has budgeted $141m for 900 extra staff, four new offices, extended opening hours and and training to avoid the bottlenecks, high failure rates and other snafus which impeded applicants in other states. “DMV is committed to successfully implementing this new law to increase safety on California roads by putting licensed drivers behind the steering wheel,” said DMV director Jean Shiomoto. “Californians planning to apply for a new driver license under AB60 should study for their exams and gather the required documents for proving identity and residency.” The license includes a distinct marking from those issued to US citizens and legal residents. A 2013 report by the California DMV found that unlicensed drivers were three times more likely to cause an accident than those with licenses. They were also more likely to flee the scene because being caught driving without a license can trigger deportation. Decades ago, undocumented people were able to obtain a driving license because applicants did not have to prove legal immigration status. A 1993 law, passed amid anti-illegal immigration sentiment, changed that by obliging first-time applicants to provide a social security number. With California public sentiment now swinging the other way, campaigners lobbied lawmakers to back to AB60 last year. Governor Jerry Brown, a Democrat, signed it, saying undocumented people no longer lived in the shadows.  “They are alive and well and respected in the state of California,” he said. Immigrant rights activists urged those who had previously obtained a driver’s license under a false name or with another person’s social security number to consult a lawyer before applying, lest their application should trigger a fraud investigation.",profile/rorycarroll,Carroll,Rory
132,2015-01-01T21:02:23Z,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jan/01/duluth-police-body-camera-footage-legal-battleground,Duluth case shows police body camera footage is new legal battleground,us-news,US news,The Guardian,"When a man in Duluth, Minnesota, barricaded himself in a garage at his home and threatened to kill himself with a knife, police officers shot him twice. The incident, which happened in August, was captured on police body cameras. Months later, city officials who want the body camera video kept secret are in a battle with advocates of police accountability that many believe will be fought out in the Minnesota legislature. The man who was shot by police, 34-year-old Joe Zontelli, survived. The two officers involved were cleared of wrongdoing. But the incident made news in the midwest city of 86,000, and after an investigation was completed by the St Louis County attorney Mark S Rubin, reporters expected the video to be released. It was not. “The state crime lab kind of takes over the investigation and we just kind of waited out the results,” said Tom Olsen, a reporter for the Duluth News Tribune who filed a public records request for the police body camera videos. He said that under normal circumstances, reporters would have received their information requests after an investigation was complete and a press conference held. The county prosecutor reviewed body camera footage, but authorities didn’t release the videos. Gunnar Johnson, the Duluth city attorney, instead used a legal maneuver to try to temporarily classify the video – and future videos from other cases Duluth requested the state clarify what body camera footage is public and what should be kept private, through an unusual request to Minnesota’s information policy analysis division. The office denied Duluth’s request, in what will be the final word on the issue unless the legislature picks it up this spring. Johnson said his office was now “working” with the decision, “with the support of other municipalities”. “It’s a difference between a piece of paper and a videotape,” he said. “[Body camera footage] can span for, you know, an hour, two hours, there can be multiple cameras and, administratively, it’s a whole different world.” The city requested that blanket secrecy be applied to body camera footage taken in schools, hospitals and “private places”. The city also wanted footage from mental health crises, suspected juvenile crimes, and response to domestic and sexual assault to be classified as private. Summaries of many of the same law enforcement activities are publicly available through police reports.  Privacy experts and law enforcement alike issued warnings about situations like that in Duluth. Transparency programs are politically popular, but in practice, many governments seek veto power over what is public. Given that Duluth police officers entered Zontelli’s home, followed him to the garage and saw blood beneath the barricaded door while he threatened his own life, it is understandable that releasing body camera video of the incident might be seen as invasive. Typically, a home is considered a private place and health issues a private matter. But when officers broke down the door, saw Zontelli had a knife, shot him twice and then claimed they had feared for their lives, some say the line between public and private vanished. Advocates say any officer-involved shooting is a matter of public interest. “One of the reasons for the body cam is to have the availability to see if law enforcement is doing their job,” said Rich Neumeister, a long-time privacy and freedom of information activist in Minnesota. “When I look at it in balancing the public interest weighs out, because this is where [residents] are shot by officers. There’s no ifs, ands or buts. It’s fact.” City police disagree. “I’m a huge proponent of cameras,” the Duluth police chief, Gordon Ramsay, told the Duluth News Tribune. “But we need to figure out how to balance the need for transparency while respecting the privacy expectations of our citizenry.” In June, Duluth became the first major police department in Minnesota to roll out body-worn cameras. But as the cameras are pushed by politicians – in the aftermath of this year’s civil unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, President Barack Obama proposed $263m in federal funding to put 50,000 more cameras on the streets – Duluth is unlikely to be the only department facing policy questions. Leading privacy and anti-surveillance advocates at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) are cautiously optimistic about the deployment of body cameras, but cite the lack of policy on the subject as worrisome. The organization recently asked 30 leading departments for their body-worn camera policies. “A large percentage of them simply don’t have them,” said Chris Rickerd, policy counsel for the ACLU. “The idea of rushing out something that is so important for accountability if the right policies are in place without these complicated, thorny issues thought through … is really irresponsible.” Olsen provided a copy of Duluth’s body camera policy, after Johnson told the Guardian a public records request would need to be filed to obtain a copy, a process that typically takes weeks. The policy requires officers to turn the cameras on during “crimes in progress” and “use of force”. But the policy does not answer more detailed questions about privacy, such as whether to record when interviewing children or whether residents can opt out of recording. “That’s a good question,” Johnson said. The state’s response to Duluth’s request was cut and dried – public records law is there, follow it. But the agency’s director said she understood that following the law was not. “Duluth didn’t have to request this temporary classification,” said Stacie Christensen, director of the Minnesota information policy analysis division, which handled the request. “I think the city attorney was speaking to the new technology and just the fact that the law hasn’t kept up with technological advances.”  “We certainly understand the difficulties in trying to redact a videotape, that’s something that will never be easy,” said Christensen. “When you actually have to deal with a request, and deal with what is public and what is not public, that is certainly where it gets complicated.” However unnerving the situation is for officials in Duluth, it may soon come to a head. Olsen said he senses the city may be “preparing right now to release that particular video”.",profile/jessica-glenza,Jessica,Glenza

But there’s another sort of show for which the laments of the goodbye back-slappers risk being drowned out by the backlashers holding their own leaving party. It will happen to Mrs Brown’s Boys and Derek and it happened to Miranda. At 8.30pm, the final episode of Ms Hart’s self-starring, self-written and self-named comedy ended with the bulky, clumsy title character finally hooking up with Gary, her hot-and-cold chef boyfriend. Like spectators at an Olympic slalom race, the studio audience ooohed and aaahed at the engagements and break-ups spread through the two-part finale before cheering as Miranda, after six years of being comically mistaken for a man, married one, with her hero Gary Barlow, continuing his rehabilitation from complex tax arrangements, playing the piano at the ceremony. The fact that Miranda’s farewell was spread over the two most coveted winter holiday slots – peaktime BBC1 on New Year’s Day and Christmas Day – is a measure of how the show is treasured. But, despite the millions of viewers who enjoy Hart’s combination of slapstick and social satire, there seem to be many who find it silly and soppy. The complaints of the opposition mainly involve the alleged retro nature of her comedy. Familiar aspects include slapstick that follows in unsteady, Morecambesque footsteps – Miranda rarely remains vertical for the full half-hour – and characterisation through catchphrases: a mother who prefaces everyday words with “what I call a” and a posh friend from whose mouth, for instance, “no way” becomes “noweiderhosen.” Those of us who are fans of Miranda would argue that high-class homage is preferable to fitful invention and each of the old-fashioned elements – prat-falls, signature sayings and love story – is handled with panache. Also, Hart is echoing TV comedy’s past not from conservatism or laziness but a scholastic fascination with the conventions: the key to her comedic instincts was a recent Christmas documentary in which she profiled Morecambe & Wise, more or less positioning herself as a female reincarnation of Eric: baffled, tactless, awkward, sardonically catching the camera’s eye: the series ending with a “love you” to us, the viewers. But, though following in a tradition, the show also contains originality, in such painfully funny sequences as Miranda pretending to be on an exotic holiday while staying in a hotel round the corner from her flat and a weird storyline in which she and her mother are confined in the office of an almost-silent family therapist, who was brought back for the final scenes. The two-part finale contained prime examples of the elements that have polarised the show’s reception. There was more elaborately choreographed catastrophe of lankiness, in which the protagonist found herself being dragged up a shop escalator, forced to talk in a strangulated upper-class voice while accidentally hooked to the coat of a shopper deafened by headphones. And the mood shifted from sitcom to romcom and, eventually, just rom as Miranda and Gary ended the penultimate episode with a bleak falling-out over commitment and then the ultimate one with a sweet reunion at a gay wedding. So, if Hart sticks to her retirement of the franchise, her eponymous comedy will total 20 episodes, a familiar sort of figure in contemporary British TV. Whereas hit American comedies have often run for a decade or more – partly because acting contracts there routinely include long-term options and a large volume of episodes makes re-run syndication more lucrative – the younger generation of UK comedians seem increasingly influenced by the example of John Cleese, who halted Fawlty Towers after only two runs consisting of 12 episodes. Another factor is that stars now tend to out-grow sitcoms very fast. Actors in top comedies have always done other things: the cast of Dad’s Army and The Good Life were frequently to be found on West End and regional stages. But a successful telly comedy can now launch arena comedy tours, best-selling books and even Hollywood or Broadway careers. This model was established by Gervais (followed by his Office co-star Martin Freeman) and then by Chris O’Dowd and Richard Ayoade of The IT Crowd and James Corden from Gavin and Stacey. Miranda Hart hasn’t yet become an American star – although she has a role in the Hollywood film Spy, due to open in May – but has accumulated all of the other trappings of the portfolio comedian: stand-up tour (the cannily branded “What I Call My Tour”), books and other TV roles, including Call the Midwife. As admirers had hoped, Miranda ended up on the floor twice in her comedy send-offs. But her expanding career, of which her inventive and well-acted sitcom is only a small part, suggests that her detractors are unlikely to get their wish of her falling metaphorically flat on her face.",profile/marklawson,Mark,Lawson

The movie is set in, indeed drenched in, the time of its filming, 1986, and for me it conjures the 80s more powerfully than any number of yuppies or padded shoulders. It features characters with cigarettes instead of mobile phones; there is aimless dialogue about what to do over the summer (Woody Allen is the only other director to give his characters quite so much leisure in the middle of the year), frizzy and studenty hair, and allegedly straight guys wearing the most extraordinary clothes. With its improvised dialogue, and walking-pace narrative, The Green Ray looks like a documentary about a fictional character. Marie Rivière gives a wonderful performance as Delphine, a shy, sensitive young woman who has just broken up with her boyfriend; the realisation that she has nowhere to go for the summer, and no one to go with, triggers a profound, poignant depression. Hectoring, insensitive friends make things worse with their strident advice that she should get out more. Delphine keeps crying, devastated at her own sadness and humiliated at being seen to be sad in a world of couples. After various unhappy attempts at getting away, there is a kind of miracle: Delphine hears about the phenomenon of the green ray, a flash of green light sometimes visible at sunset. She might witness it, and even have someone to witness it with. A lovely, gentle film.",,,

A deep area of low pressure across the UK on Boxing Day plunged southwards through France and into the Alps on Saturday. Very cold air, both ahead of and behind the winter storm, allowed precipitation to fall widely as snow. Between 80cm-100cm fell in parts of the French Alps, and while this was good for the ski industry following a poor early season, thousands were left stranded in their cars as travel chaos ensued. The Savoy region was particularly hard-hit, with an estimated 15,000 people requiring emergency shelter. During the holiday period, unusually heavy rain has affected parts of eastern Asia, with Malaysia hardest hit. While flooding is commonplace during the monsoon season, the extent and intensity of rain over the past week has been described as the worst in three decades. Widespread flooding has displaced at least 150,000 people, submerging hundreds of towns and villages and reportedly causing the death of 10 people. Thailand has also been affected, with nearly 10,000 people forced from their homes as the waters rose. Meanwhile, violent thunderstorms have been unleashing damaging winds and torrential rain on eastern Brazil over the past couple of days. The area around Sao Paulo has been worst affected with trees blown down and electricity supplies cut. At Praia Grande, near the city of Santos, lightning struck a crowded beach on Monday, killing four members of the same family and injuring several others.",,,

Wanderers remain rooted to the bottom of the table, having scored just six times in the league, despite their international exploits. The Mariners are little better, having failed to win since the opening round of the A-League and netting just 10 times in 13 games. Shannon Cole and goalkeeper Ante Covic were among the players who went over to acknowledge supporters at the end of the game, but ended up in a forthright exchange of views and angry finger-pointing. One fan had to be held back from trying to jump the fence. Neither side seemed capable of producing the guile needed to prise open the other’s defence. Both created a number of chances, but lacked a clinical finisher. The Wanderers had most of the best opportunities in the first half until the last minute, when Covic produced a triple save. He parried a long range effort and reacted quickly to block closer range efforts from Nick Fitzgerald and Josh Rose. The Mariners wasted a series of free kicks within 30 metres of the Wanderers goal and repeatedly wildly shot from distance in the absence of any more imaginative ideas. Nikita Rukavytsya was the Wanderers’ primary attacking threat in the first half. In just the second minute, he was foiled by Mariners goalkeeper Liam Reddy and had another attempt on target later in the half, while Labinot Haliti headed a chance straight at the Central Coast keeper. Haliti put another header wide in the second half, in which Mariners fullback Josh Rose was a central figure at opposite ends in the first few minutes. He cleared an acrobatic scissors kick from Wanderers debutant Nick Kalmar off the line, then flicked the roof of the net with an attempt at the other end. Both coaches bemoaned their team’s continuing lack of luck in front of goal, but drew some encouragement. Wanderers boss Tony Popovic said his side was still playing with belief and their positive approach would yield rewards down the track. “I felt throughout the 90 minutes that only we would win the game,” Popovic said. “But it was also important not to throw it away. “The players are still patient, still believing, but the good play is just not being rewarded with goals.” Mariners coach Phil Moss was happy his team had a clean sheet after conceding seven goals in their previous two games. “I think we’ve started the new year on a very good foot coming here and getting a point against an absolutely desperate Wanderers side,” Moss said. “They probably dominated us for periods in the first half, but I felt we were probably the more dominant team in the second half.”",,,

He brings a formidable atmosphere and control to this intriguing, disquieting film: the double theme is a notorious film-school cliche, and using the same actor in two roles can be a lazy shortcut to the uncanny. But Villeneuve’s film earns its anxiety. Jake Gyllenhaal gives the dual performance: a depressed history lecturer in Toronto who one night watches a movie and glimpses an actor who appears to be his exact duplicate. He seeks out this mirror image; their encounter gives rise to hostility, terror, a kind of mutually agreed nervous breakdown, but a thrilling sense of possibility, an escape from the prison house of individuality. There is something of David Cronenberg’s Dead Ringers here – maybe even a touch of Patricia Highsmith’s Strangers on a Train. There are coolly effective moments when Villeneuve declines to make it clear which double we are watching and whose memories and fears we are experiencing. The final shot is bizarre.

Gbla was delighted to find out she was having a boy. She has bought a pram, but between home renovations and a busy job she has not managed to put together a nursery yet, or even buy a cot. She is also trying to fight off the thought that she and her son could die during the delivery. When Gbla was nine or 10, as part of the family’s preparation for migrating to Australia from Sierra Leone, her mother took her to a hut where an old woman cut out her clitoris with a rusty knife. “She then threw the piece of flesh across the room like it was the most disgusting thing she’d ever seen,” Gbla recalled in a Tedx Canberra talk. Now she fears that ignorance about female genital mutilation (FGM) among Australian doctors and midwives could add dangerous pregnancy complications to the long list of traumas inflicted by the practice.  “I kind of feel I will go in and have a baby and [it] will feel like a second FGM procedure. I feel like it could be the second traumatising experience of my life,” she tells Guardian Australia from her Adelaide home. “I can’t go there and open my eyes and have someone who doesn’t know what they’re doing tell me to push … that could kill my baby. It’s too much, it does my head in. This is just not working out, it’s terrible.” Despite being told for years that she was infertile, Gbla conceived a child with her husband earlier this year. But her joy was tempered by the terrifying experience still ahead of her, and the failure of medical professionals to recognise its source. On her first visit to a midwife she was asked the usual questions. Does your family have a history of diabetes? Do you smoke? Do you take any medication? But Gbla says the midwife showed no interest in whether she had FGM, even though she comes from a country where it is commonly practised. She says a doctor subsequently told her there was no need to examine the extent of her FGM until further into her pregnancy. “I asked, don’t you want to check scar tissue?” Gbla says. “[The doctor] basically said, when you get there we’ll open you up, then sew you back up. I walked away pissed and angry. Is this the person who’s going to bring my baby into the world?” Some doctors who serve FGM-affected communities agree there is an urgent need for more awareness. Obstetrician Greg Jenkins, who conducts a weekly high-risk antenatal clinic at Auburn Hospital in western Sydney, says discussion about FGM should happen well before an expectant mother reaches the delivery room, and doctors should be more aware of the risks it poses. “It definitely should happen ... overall increasing awareness is an important thing and then equipping people with information that they need in treating them is important,” he says.    Campaigners march against female genital mutilation in Kenya. Photograph: Antony Njuguna/Reuters   A dearth of data The World Health Organisation classifies FGM by three types. Type 1 involves cutting out the clitoris. In type 2 the labia minora is also cut out, wholly or partially. Type 3 refers to sewing up the vagina to create a very small hole, which may also include removing the clitoris. Among the many complications from FGM are pregnancy and birth risks. Some doctors perform a procedure to open up the vagina before the birth, or opt for a caesarean. Even with these precautions the rate of newborn deaths is higher for women with FGM than those without FGM.  Data on FGM survivors and those at risk in Australia is negligible. No official statistics are kept by gynaecologists on women they treat with FGM, and doctors do not report how many babies are delivered to women with FGM.  Nor is there undisputed data on how many girls in Australia are at risk of FGM. Legislation around FGM is the responsibility of the states, but is more or less uniform. In all states and territories it is illegal to carry out FGM, and to take an Australian citizen out of the country to undergo FGM. There are believed to be 34,000 women in NSW and 83,000 across Australia from countries where FGM is practised to a greater or lesser extent – predominantly Iraq, Pakistan, Indonesia, Egypt and west African countries. An analysis of the data commissioned by No FGM Australia, of which Gbla is a director, estimated there were 5,640 girls under 15 at high risk of FGM in Australia. She counts herself as one of the “lucky” FGM survivors. At least she was confident enough to raise it with her doctors. Countless other women would not do so, or do not even know they have FGM, she says. As a result, when they give birth their doctors do not know about their FGM until they are in the delivery room. Views diverge on how best to end the silence and ignorance that surrounds FGM. Many survivors are reluctant to speak about what they regard as a private matter, and advocates are eager to raise awareness, but wary of making survivors feel their entire culture is being criticised. Some advocates argue FGM is not a violent practice and, while it needs to be stopped, the debate should be framed thoughtfully, particularly in western countries where women with FGM can end up feeling ashamed of their culture or isolated from the wider community. Gbla is emphatic in her view that FGM is abuse and will not be stopped with a “softly, softly” approach. “When I think of FGM I think of someone pinning me down and holding a rusty knife, and cutting away at my flesh, and I’m begging them to stop and they don’t. I would think anyone would call it violence – there’s no way to turn it around, taking a knife to a little girl’s private parts is violence. They’re taking a sharp object, a rusty knife and poor, scared little children then left there to bleed,” she says. “It’s child abuse, it’s not about culture, there’s no cultural defence for any kind of abuse. Nobody should be able to hide behind culture, this is about patriarchy, gender, this is about trying to control the sexuality of women.”    A female genital mutilation counsellor in Egypt. Photograph: Tara Todras-Whitehill/Reuters   Vivienne Strong, who manages the NSW education program on FGM, is much less inclined to dismiss the claim that FGM may be viewed by some as a legitimate cultural practice. In spreading the message that FGM is both illegal and dangerous, she works with facilitators whose background is in each country where FGM is prevalent, so the target groups do not feel they are being singled out by a white society.  “It’s extremely important to communities that they’re treated with respect, that the women are treated with respect. And that we recognise that this is a cultural practice, it’s not a practice of violence, as seen by people in a traditional setting, it’s seen as a practice that makes their daughter acceptable in those societies. Respect for people’s cultural differences while recognising the harm this particular practice can cause [is important], and that of course comes under the banner of the rights of the child, the rights of the adolescent, the rights of girls.” The legacy of FGM The effects of FGM ring through a survivor’s life, often interfering with periods, sexual development and fertility, and leaving a lasting psychological legacy. Gbla, one of Australia’s few outspoken FGM survivors, sarcastically refers to FGM as “the gift that keeps on giving”. Almost crippled by her periods when she was a teenager growing up in Adelaide, she discovered she had FGM when she saw a poster showing the three types and recalled a long buried memory of the woman who cut her.  A long period of fury followed, particularly at her mother, who also had FGM when she was a young girl. “How could you do this to me?” she asked her mother repeatedly. Her mother refuses to apologise. Gbla’s most enduring grief as an FGM survivor has been for her sexuality. Flicking through magazines such as Dolly when she was a teenager, she was puzzled by the articles aimed at helping girls come to terms with their raging hormones and questions to Dolly Doctor about the sensations “down there”. Khadija says she felt nothing but “numbness”. “It’s almost like your vagina is inactive. So really your sexuality is messed up, you don’t feel horny, you don’t have sexual desire, you just feel numb down there, when you touch it there’s just nothing happening,” she says. “We just have no chance at all in terms of sexual pleasure. It makes you question your sexual orientation – when I was a teenager thought I was asexual. I didn’t feel like sex, ever … I do have sex but have no desire to.” She says she longs for an orgasm, having often thought of sex as a chore, something in which she is not really a participant.  “I get some sensation with my husband, who’s very wonderful, we talk and experiment … I’m fighting to regain that power and control. So many women don’t think they have alternatives. There’s not much research into this area. “When I was growing up my mum would say sex is two minutes and then it’s over, you’re not meant to enjoy it ... you do it and you make a baby. As for the pain, she doesn’t care, she doesn’t feel guilty that she did that to me,” she says. Evidence FGM is declining disputed Some advocates believe the incidence of FGM in Australia is declining, though again the data is scant.     Anti-FGM campaigner Khadija Gbla does not agree with those who say cultural sensitivity is needed in the fight to eradicate it. She says it is a violent act against women. Photograph: Russell Millard   The executive director of the Women’s Multicultural Centre in Melbourne, Adele Murdolo, refers to a University of Melbourne study, which found the practice was declining in that city. “There are really clear indications it’s a declining practice, it’s not something the communities, once they’ve arrived in Australia … are holding onto. There are strong indications it’s a less attractive proposition,” Murdolo says. But the study is viewed warily by No FGM Australia, which argues that it accepted at face value denials from women that they would undertake the practice in Australia.  The group’s director, Paula Ferrari, asks: “Why would they admit to a practice they know is illegal?” Solid data on prevalence is important for advocates to understand which strategies are most effective in combating FGM.  The NSW education program on FGM has been running for 17 years and Vivienne Strong, with a team of four in her western Sydney office, has a long list of its achievements, including engaging men from FGM-affected communities and an outreach program for rural and regional areas. But she concedes it is challenging getting into schools to educate teachers in the crucial task of identifying girls at risk, because of the many demands on the teachers’ time. Murdolo’s Melbourne centre uses an international review of best practice and tries to pick up programs that have been evaluated and proved effective. She agrees that building up women in FGM-affected communities to speak out, and involving men, are key planks of the work. “What you normally get is a divided community – some people think that it’s something that’s needed when others are not so committed to it or strongly opposed to it,” she says. “The idea is getting conversations happening ... It’s about attitudes, not just attitudes to the practice but attitudes to gender equality.” Two prosecutions for FGM-related offences are making their way through the NSW court system. A Sydney man has been charged over the genital mutilation of his daughter when she was nine months old. It has been alleged he took her overseas for the procedure, which was discovered when the girl’s mother took her to a doctor. In a separate case a woman, a nurse and a sheikh have been charged over the genital mutilation of two sisters, aged six and seven, in the living room of a western Sydney home. Both cases have been set down for trial this year. In the second case the court has heard the sheikh told locals to lie to police about the prevalence of FGM in the community. Last month a Brisbane girl was reportedly taken to a west African country by her father to undergo FGM. Federal police are investigating. As ever, funding for services is a constant battle. The British government has committed £35m to ending FGM. Murdolo says Australia could do with a commitment that was even a quarter of that. The money, she says, should be put towards the unglamorous but important job of rationalising resources strewn between states and territories. “There’s a lot of knowledge accumulated but there hasn’t been enough commitment to coordinating all of that work,” she said. “Every state and territory has resources, but it’s really inconsistent.” Gbla agrees it is all about education, to break the silence and embarrassment. Educating doctors and nurses, educating child protection officers, educating teachers, educating the girls who are or could be affected by it. “I don’t like walking around being the face of FGM. I’d rather be the face of lipstick, because I have nice lips, but instead I’m the woman everyone knows has FGM. “At every stage of your life it impacts you, every woman has her own shame and her own isolation in their own experience. I want people to know how terrible this is, I will stand up and say, ‘I don’t have a clitoris’. There is so much education that needs to be done. Our mothers aren’t going to help us, they’re not going to comfort us. It’s up to us.”",profile/bridie-jabour,Bridie,Jabour

After the frying-pan of directing Lindsay Lohan in The Canyons comes the fire of Dying of the Light, a punch-drunk terrorist thriller that wound up being confiscated by the backers and re-edited behind his back. The finished film is a hobbled orphan, disowned by its director and often wheezing when it should be raging. If its heart still beats, that’s solely thanks to Nicolas Cage’s barnstorming performance as rogue CIA operative Evan Lake, battling dementia as he pursues an old tormentor. Voice hoarse, hands trembling, Lake burns bridges with abandon, alienates supporters and proceeds to sail off the map in pursuit of his lost cause.

But what does it mean to get older, or indeed, younger? “Adults are obsolete children,” said the perky, mischievous rhymer Dr Seuss. “A man growing old becomes a child again,” countered the beard-tugging Sophocles. “Forty is the old age of youth; 50 the youth of old age,” chipped in Victor Hugo. “Middle age is when you’re sitting at home on a Saturday night and the telephone rings and you hope it isn’t for you,” added Ogden Nash, in the rocking chair. “Age appears to be best in four things; old wood best to burn, old wine to drink, old friends to trust, and old authors to read,” said a sagely Francis Bacon. Can anyone do better than that? Reaching for the last word, Theodore Roosevelt remarked that “Old age is like everything else. To make a success of it, you’ve got to start young.” Oops. Indeed. Better get on with it then.    Another entirely gratuitous cute image to illustrate youth and age … baby sulcatta tortoises with their mother at Lake District Wild Life Park in Keswick. Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA   So then, ringing in the first full night of the new year, there’s veritable cavalcade of characters at the Readers Recommend pub tonight with remarks already flooding in. So welcome one, welcome all, for we start 2015 on a theme of songs about ages – from zero to as old as you can get, in numbers or other references to length of living. Who’s next? Now Mark Twain has jumped the queue, ordering himself a sneaky bourbon, with the line: “Age is an issue of mind over matter. If you don’t mind, it doesn’t matter.” But does it? Your song suggestions, RR friends, can mention any age, but what is it about certain numbers of years, and why do they matter? Are you as old as you feel, or any other innuendo-related version of this theory? Why is 16 special and is it really ever sweet? What’s so great about 21? Why have so many great performers died at the age of 27 (from Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin, Brian Jones, Jimi Hendrix, Kurt Cobain, Amy Winehouse, Ron McKernan, Dave Alexander, to Alan ‘Blind Owl’ Wilson)? Is 40 unloved for “fairies” or others, and how is it at 64? Perhaps your song nominations can cover every decade, and name every number. Milestones of age have always seemed important, but why every 10? That’s probably because of the number of fingers and thumbs or toes we generally possess. If we had six digits on each hand, we would probably get wound up about being 12, 24, 36 and so on.    Jim Morrison of the Doors, a prominent member of the fatal 27 club. Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives   The passing of time and perception of age has been a rich source of inspiration in film and literature. James Joyce’s Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man ingeniously begins its narrative in baby language, gradually maturing in style as the protagonist, Stephen Daedalus, gets older. Richard Linklater’s strangely alluring and touching film, Boyhood (2014) was made over 12 years, and follows a six-year-old and his fictional family passing through the ups and downs of growing up to college years. Tokyo Story (1953) is a supremely moving and profound tale of an elderly couple visiting their busy son and daughter in the big city. Strangers in Good Company (1990) is a lesser known film featuring eight non-professional acting older ladies who take a bus trip to the Canadian countryside and, in docu-fiction style, improvise and banter about their lives and form unlikely friendships. Harold and Maude (1971) is a hilarious, oddball masterpiece, laced with Cat Stevens songs, about a wealthy young man who is obsessed with death falling into a relationship with a more than lively older lady – one of my favourite films in which the definition of age is brilliantly turned on its head.   Harold and Maude … Who’s old? Who’s young?  But perhaps the most famous, non-fictional portrait of growing up, and capturing the passing of time, is the ongoing 7Up series, which was jointly created by Michael Apted in 1964, following 14 then seven-year-old British schoolchildren from differing backgrounds, variously revisited every seven years ever since, with the latest being 56Up in 2012. It remains a snapshot of life’s hopes, dreams, triumphs and disappointments. Like a stick of rock through TV history, the perennial reappearance of these familiar but non-famous faces has a comforting, sweet banality about it, but contains the essential DNA message and of what life does to us all. Such material, for better or worse, is also the building blocks of songs.   The days of our lives. From 7Up to 56Up …  With an illuminating perspective on a span of ages, the Guinness Book of Records recorded this same recurring number – seven – as the most of generations from the same family to be alive at the same time. Great-great-great-great-grandparent Augusta Bunge (US) aged 109 years 97 days, followed by her daughter aged 89, her grand-daughter aged 70 and so on, right down to her great-great-great grand-daughter aged 15 on the birth of her great-great-great-great grandson on 21 January 1989. I recall seeing this or possibly another multi-generation family on the TV programme Record Breakers in the 1980s and it was almost impossible to tell the difference between the middle three or four women. Is age then a linear process? Can it be reversed? In December 2013 Australian and US scientists claimed to have discovered a way to make a two-year-old mouse physically resemble one of six months old, by restoring the efficiency of cells and reversing the ageing process in muscles. Possible human trials were being discussed.     Back on my feet … research showing blood components from the young can rejuvenate an old mouse’s muscles and brain. Photograph: Redmond Durrell/Alamy   In a rather different and unusual case, and harking back to Sophocles’ comment, two British brothers, Michael and Matthew Clark were found to have a rare genetic disorder, leukodystrophy, that turned them from normal middle-aged men into adults with childlike behavioural regression. They were dubbed “real-life Benjamin Buttons” after the long, sentimental film about age reversal starring Brad Pitt. Tragically the brothers became unable to look after themselves and had to go back to their parents. Their interests began to turn to their childhood. One, for example, reportedly bought himself a train set and a Mr Potato Head, the other began to point excitedly at balloons. For songs about ages, as a guideline, some previous topics have made a few overlaps – children, teenagers, and old age – but there is still an infinite of actual ages to pick out and these can span all generations.

141,2015-01-01T22:00:06Z,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/jan/01/bath-northampton-premiership-dean-ryan,Bath’s Premiership clash with Northampton is worth making a date for,sport,Sport,The Guardian,"It’s a little way off yet, but a date for the new 2015 diary: Saturday 21 February is when Bath and Northampton, the sides threatening to stretch away a little at the top of the Aviva Premiership, go head to head. It might not settle anything because both will be looking ahead to the semi-final and final dates in May, but going into the second half of the regular season you can guarantee that that Saturday at the Rec will be tasty as two sides, currently separated by a point after 11 rounds, confront each other with their contrary mindsets. Take a look at the league table and there’s barely a fag paper between them. Both have won nine and lost two. Northampton have scored 342 points and conceded 188, while Bath’s figures are 345 and 190. Tries for and against go 42/21 to 38/20. But how those statistics confuse rather than inform. Northampton and Bath are chalk and cheese. If you have any doubts, looks back at Saturday’s highlights. A week after inflicting a record home defeat on Gloucester, Bath took a four-try bonus point off Exeter, not so long ago Premiership leaders themselves and still third in the table when they ran out at the Rec to face a side intent on ripping it up. For those of us who were around in Newcastle when Kevin Keegan reigned at St James’ Park, there is an element of those days at the Rec; the “love it, love it” days when Keegan reckoned his side could afford to concede three goals because they would score four. Heady days, but with George Ford running from under his own posts, Kyle Eastmond and Jonathan Joseph weaving patterns in midfield and Anthony Watson looking deadly every time he got involved from full-back there were times when Exeter looked as though they might be torn apart. This hybrid union/league style that Bath are developing with Eastmond and Ford equally at home as first receiver and playmaker is a delight to watch and will put bums on seats, but does it win matches? Against lesser sides most certainly, but after 50 minutes against Exeter, the scoreline at the Rec was 14-14 and it wasn’t until the big men – Dave Attwood, Davey Wilson – arrived from the bench that the game was settled. Instead of deft touches (and mistakes; both Exeter tries came from Ford forcing things) we had a stolen lineout and a 30-metre rolling maul. Compare and contrast with Twickenham later that day when Northampton beat an all-singing all-dancing Harlequins despite having the ball in their hands for less than a quarter of the game. Harlequins made 48 tackles, Northampton 156. Quins carried 164 times, Saints 46. Impressive stats, but the only one worth its weight was Harlequins 25, Northampton 30. If Bath are evolving and still a little way off where they want to be or knowing where they want to be – how for example does Sam Burgess fit into the game as currently seen by Ford and Eastmond? – then Northampton know where they are and look pretty happy about it. Not so long ago there were plenty, me included, who thought Northampton a bit one dimensional. How they relied on Soane Tongauiha and Brian Mujati, the props who seemed to start every game and play 75 minutes. There was plenty of broadsword and only a little rapier, but things have changed, possibly as a result of Alex King, the guy who used to pull the strings when Wasps were winning Heineken Cups, joining from Clermont Auvergne. During the King era at Franklin’s Gardens we have seen the brothers Pisi – George in the centre, Ken on the wing – become more influential. Ben Foden is close to his sharpest and Stephen Myler, another recruit from league and therefore someone who had to go through the learning process that Burgess faces, has added multiple dimensions to his game. And of course there is no point in recruiting George North and playing the limited muscular game. The big men still have their say, of course they do, but it is within a more formal union pattern– and it works. Tries for Northampton in 11 games, 42, as against the 38 for Bath and while the bells and whistles may be making a din at the Rec, Franklin’s Gardens is rarely less than sold out. However, there is one aspect of what Jim Mallinder is doing that will particularly impress other head coaches and directors of rugby. Building a team is one thing, keeping it together is another – and doing it while you are defending a title is like juggling six balls while speeding downhill on a unicycle. In the last couple of weeks Northampton have announced a raft of re-signings. OK, we know that Toulon are claiming Samu Manoa, but given that this is a World Cup year and a time when sought-after players tend to “review” their career paths, Mallinder has done brilliantly to hold on to Myler, George Pisi, Courtney Lawes, the Wallers Alex and Ethan, Calum Clark, Luther Burrell and especially his captain Dylan Hartley, apparently much wanted in France. And that meeting in February? Northampton by a whisker. And it’ll be fun.",profile/dean-ryan,ryan,dean

Jason Valentine is accused of 10 counts of making a terrorist threat, a felony punishable by up to seven years in prison in Missouri. The charges relate to 10 tweets that Valentine, 35, is alleged to have posted in December with the intention of “frightening 10 or more people”. Several referred to New Year’s Eve as “kill a pig night”, according to a probable cause statement released on Thursday by the St Louis circuit attorney, which claimed Valentine “used the slang ‘pig’ … to describe police officers” and was threatening to kill them.     Jason Valentine, in a photograph provided by St Louis police. Photograph: St Louis police department   One tweet allegedly said: “St Louis City Justice Center Mysteriously Exploded 12/31/2014”. Prosecutors charge that was a threat to cause an explosion at the building. Their statement said police “considered these threats to be serious in nature” and claimed that “kill a pig night” had “gained momentum nationally”. Another tweet allegedly used the hashtag “#KillJeffRoorda”. Roorda, the business manager of the St Louis Police Officers Association, is a prominent supporter of Darren Wilson, the Ferguson police officer who shot dead Michael Brown after an altercation on 9 August. Brown’s death was followed by several nights of protests that met a heavy response from police and reopened a national debate about policing and race relations. The town was hit by looting and arson after a grand jury declined in November to charge Wilson with a crime. Nine of the 10 tweets allegedly posted by Valentine featured a “Ferguson” hashtag; all referenced Vonderrit Myers, a black 18-year-old who was shot dead after allegedly shooting at an off-duty St Louis police officer in the Shaw neighbourhood in October, prompting further protests. According to the probable cause statement, Valentine “admits to using the Twitter user handle @jdstl314 and being the sole poster under that user handle”. The account has since been suspended and cannot be viewed. Police said Twitter suspended it on 29 December. Valentine was listed as living at an address in the Shaw neighbourhood. According to the probable cause statement he has a previous conviction for aggravated stalking and violation of a protection order. The charges are due to be presented to a grand jury for consideration.",profile/jon-swaine,Jon,Swaine
143,2015-01-01T22:36:32Z,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jan/01/peter-greste-retrial-order-opens-up-more-options-for-his-release,Peter Greste retrial order opens up 'more options' for his release,media,Media,The Guardian,"The retrial of Australian journalist Peter Greste, ordered by Egyptian courts overnight, opens up “more options and more possibilities” for his release, the foreign minister Julie Bishop says. The Egyptian court of cassation upheld an appeal by Greste and his al-Jazeera colleagues Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed after the trio were found guilty of spreading false news and supporting the now-banned Muslim Brotherhood organisation in June. “There is some cause for optimism because now Peter Greste’s appeal has been upheld, that means the conviction has been overturned,” Bishop told the Nine network early on Friday morning. “He is now back in the position of an accused person awaiting a trial. So that opens up a whole raft of new options for Peter and his family.” Greste and Fahmy, who is a dual Egyptian-Canadian national, have applied for deportation. “In the past, the Egyptian government has indicated that they would consider some kind of prisoner transfer agreement and they do have a new law that was introduced recently, and it does give some optimism for us that he could be transferred back to Australia under that law,” Bishop said. “However, now that the appeal has been upheld, the conviction overturned, I think there are more possibilities, more options available to the Grestes.” Greste’s brothers Andrew and Mike told reporters in Brisbane the family was disappointed the charges were not quashed but a retrial was “the next best result for us”. “It’s been recognised the first trial was flawed,” Mike Greste said. “Peter in our view is completely innocent, so now the court recognises he’s now an innocent man and we start again.” Andrew Greste said the change in status from a convict to an accused person “really does strengthen” his brother’s bid for deportation to Australia by presidential decree. Peter Greste’s lawyer has now amended an application originally made several weeks ago. The family was now fixing its hopes on deportation as the best chance of getting Greste home because a retrial – which would be the journalist’s next opportunity for release on bail – could be a “lengthy” process some months away.  “We’ve got to be hopeful,” Andrew said. “It’s a new decree and there’s very little understood about it. There’s very little regulation, there’s no precedent, so obviously we’re in uncharted waters there. But I’d like to think the decree was enacted to be used, so we’re going to test it out.” The family did not know Peter’s response to news of the retrial, as no one would be allowed to speak to him until Sunday. “I’m assuming the grapevine has probably run pretty well and he knows the outcome of the decision but as to a reaction from him, we don’t [know],” Andrew said. Bishop dismissed calls from the Australian-born human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson for the Australian government to “shirt-front” president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi over Greste’s release. “I think the course of action that he is suggesting would have been highly counterproductive,” she said. “Is he suggesting that if an Egyptian national were before a British court, he would be shirt-fronting British judges? I think not. “If this were an Egyptian national facing controversial charges in a court in Australia, we wouldn’t be in a position to interfere with the independence of the Australian judiciary. Well, President al-Sisi is saying that the same applies in Egypt,” Bishop said. Robertson said Greste’s best hope of release lay with a political solution rather than a judicial one. “This is a game, a cat-and-mouse game and it’s silly to pin hopes on the kinds of things that happen in Australian courts, where you have bail hearings and so forth,” Robertson told ABC radio on Friday morning. “This will be solved only when leaders and governments in the western world that have some sway over Egypt, like America, start speaking out about the preposterous way in which Egypt is dealing with journalists who are utterly innocent.” Robertson has raised concerns about Egyptian prosecution lawyers introducing “fabricated evidence” during Greste’s retrial, which he said could potentially turn into a “show trial”. “It’s a cat-and-mouse game which a system can play, and it’s been very effective for the Egyptians,” Robertson said. “The stage of public condemnation may be the best way forward for Peter Greste and his innocent friends.”",profile/shalailah-medhora,medhora,shalailah

The Portuguese’s side were stunned 5-3 by Tottenham Hotspur, only the second time in a 14-year managerial career one of his teams has shipped five goals, to lose their points advantage at the top of the table and remain at the summit only on alphabetical order from Manchester City. That has left them with only one win in five away games but, while he acknowledged defensive deficiencies, Mourinho reserved his complaints over the non-award of a penalty for Jan Vertonghen’s handball when his team had actually led 1-0. His criticism of the referee Phil Dowd’s performance included a suggestion he was “40 yards” off the pace when Federico Fazio challenged Hazard late on, a tackle the Belgian subsequently acknowledged had been legitimate and did not prompt sanction. Yet his frustration merely mirrored that from after the draw at Southampton on Sunday when Cesc Fàbregas had been booked for simulation having been clipped by Matt Targett in the penalty area. “In the 20 league matches we have played we have been the most offensive team, the team with more creative players in attacking areas,” he said, “and we have had two penalties in those games. “If people are in love with football in this country then they must be in love with Eden Hazard. But the way, match to match, he’s being punished by opponents and not protected by referees … maybe one day we won’t have Eden Hazard. It’s one, two, three, four, five, 10 aggressive fouls against him. They kick and kick and kick, and the kid resists. He’s a very honest guy in the way he plays but that’s another problem.” Chelsea were badly exposed by a fine Tottenham forward line led superbly by Harry Kane and could yet find their centre-half, Gary Cahill, sanctioned retrospectively for appearing to kick the grounded England Under-21 international in the back and on the calf in front of the dug-outs. “I didn’t see that, but was it [in the back], and not like [Raheem] Sterling in the face?” asked Mourinho, although the manager was perplexed Vertonghen’s handball back when the contest had remained tight had not merited a spot-kick.     José Mourinho and Mauricio Pochettino reflect on Tottenham’s win.  “I could go in two directions and say we made some defensive mistakes and that every rebound and deflected shot they had went in. We conceded five goals, which is something out of our context. But I can go in another direction and say what we all know, which is, with the result 1-0, one clear action could make it 2-0. Normally, at 2-0, the result would be completely different and the history of the game would be different. “I’m more shocked with other things than us conceding five goals. That can happen. But where I am shocked is that, in three days, we’ve had two incredible decisions that punished us in a very hard way. Two matches where we’ve come away with one point when two crucial decisions would give us six points. There are things in the game that are becoming predictable. After that there is an action on Eden Hazard which, honest as always, he tells me in his opinion was not a foul or a red card. So that is good, in spite the fact Mr Dowd was too slow to follow that ball. He was 40 yards away but made the right decision. The decision he was 10m away he couldn’t make.” That criticism of Dowd , whom Sir Alex Ferguson had infamously claimed was not fit enough to stay up with the game after booking five Manchester United players in a draw with Arsenal in April 2013, was made in a television interview, with the manager tempering his observations upon arriving at the main post-match media conference. “It is difficult for him and difficult for everyone because Fàbregas put the ball into space, Hazard attacked the space. But I knew that in case of doubt, and that situation was doubtful, it would go against us.   Related: Tottenham Hotspur 5-3 Chelsea | Premier League match report   “That’s the kind of situation we accept. The first one, in the first half, which is clear … like the one against Southampton, which was also clear. They’re the ones that are difficult to accept. But managers and players, we win and lose. And Mr Dowd didn’t lose. We didn’t lose because of the group of players. Against Newcastle we had Matic suspended but Mikel played a very good game. We lost because we were unlucky and Newcastle were lucky. Mr Atkinson had a completely clean performance. It’s the kind of game you lose. Today is a different story and against Southampton it’s again a similar story. But there is nothing we can do.”",,,

On Friday night in Geelong, to complete Round 13, Perth face an almost full-strength Melbourne Victory (the injured Daniel Georgievski and Mark Milligan, both on Socceroos’ duty, are the most notable absentees), who’ll be looking both to close the four-point gap between them and to make a point. The point being? To hazard a guess — and this despite Kevin Muscat’s efforts to exert pressure on Perth by declaring them the league’s best team — it would be this: “We don’t just play prettier football, we’re better too.” Then, on Monday night, back at home, Perth take on Adelaide in Round 14. Given the Reds’ bout of inconsistency that has seen them lose four of their past six matches, Victory would appear to be the tougher match, but then Glory haven’t beaten Josep Gombau’s team in four matches this season (including two pre-season friendlies, one league match and that FFA Cup decider). Indeed, Adelaide are the only side to defeat the Glory this campaign; registering a 2-0 win at Coopers Stadium back in Round 3. Kenny Lowe told the Guardian that losses aren’t as bad as all that “because there’s things in that experience that you can actually analyse and understand to help make yourself become even better.” Well, Monday night will show how well Perth have been paying attention. One last hurrah before the break (or possibly ‘brake’) Momentum is a wonderful thing in sport, the way any given match ebbs and flows and has periods when even an outgunned team enjoys moments of dominance. It’s fascinating, too, when a good result can spark a striving but hitherto struggling team into a run of them, confidence and belief jumping between team members like an electrical charge. Because of that, more so than any tactical changes, results start going your way. Luck joins the party, too, and the sky turns a vivid shade of blue you haven’t seen in a while. What a pity, then, for Wellington (and you can throw Melbourne City into the mix) that the A-league is about to go on ice for the duration of the Asian Cup. Heading into their home match against Brisbane on Sunday Wellington have won five and drawn one of their past six games — a run which includes their stunning 3-1 win over Adelaide on New Year’s Eve; a win picked up away from home without the league’s top scorer Nathan Burns. Prior to those six matches — in which they’ve scored 15 goals to four — they’d lost four of seven. But sparked by their 5-1 thrashing of City in Round 8 they’ve mostly been in sparkling form, and when they’ve haven’t they’ve eked out a result (that 1-1 draw with the Mariners) or found luck on their side (that dubious penalty that gifted them the win against the Wanderers earlier this week). People like Newcastle coach Phil Stubbins can’t wait for the Asian Cup break, but Ernie Merrick must be wishing there was no break at all, lest it puts the brakes on Wellington’s stirring run of form. Sydney’s best chance to stop the slide or a new nadir Graham Arnold’s Sky Blues must have almost forgotten what it feels like to win; it’s been long enough — seven matches ago on 22 November. Injuries, ennui and what Arnold may call some good old fashioned shirking have seen Sydney in freefall, and the air is still whistling around their ears ahead of Saturday’s match against Newcastle in Wollongong (where, by the by, the FFA will be keenly counting heads as part of their long-term desire to expand the competition with due consideration for a South Coast-based team). Things are so dire Arnold must be wondering where he last saw his shin pads and boots. But as a late Christmas present, Sydney get to face Newcastle, a team who, apart from that one upset win over Adelaide two rounds ago, have been obliging losers. Of course Newcastle may be thinking exactly the same thing, but Sydney won’t get a better opportunity to stop the rot. City lights Ten points from an available 12 in their past four games has put Melbourne City in a position where they could leapfrog Sydney into fifth. You scarcely would have predicted that a month ago. But from the low of their 5-1 spanking in Wellington, City have turned things around — and the big improvement has come at the back where (barring a couple of soft goals conceded to Newcastle last week when the game was safe) they’ve run the Polyfilla along their defensive line. If you don’t concede a goal you only have to score one to win. It’s not exactly rocket science, but it’s a mathematical reality bearing fruit for City at the moment. And boosting the mood at City is a fit Robert Koren, City’s marquee man. You wait so long for someone to arrive there’s a danger your expectations will get the better of you, and you’ll build him up to be a combination of Andrea Pirlo and Beethoven and not a 34-year-old who played mostly off the bench in his previous season with Hull. But then he goes and bangs in a hat-trick against Newcastle in his first full game. He won’t do that every week, of course. But he should improve City’s distribution and organisation in the middle. After such a month City are favourites to beat Central Coast on Sunday, but it’s a banana skin of a game if there ever was one. If City win they’ll enjoy the Asian Cup break better than most. If they don’t, it might feel like all their recent good work has been undone.  The long road home Measured against the world’s biggest leagues, a 27-round season is short — but when you’ve only ten sides and no relegation there comes a time every season when it can be hard to avoid the feeling that we’ve entered the doldrums. Though three points are still on offer every match, the excitement of the new season has worn off and the finals are still far enough away, even though the majority of the finalists seem to have announced themselves already. We hold on for twists and turns yet, but it would take some collapse — and unexpected rises in form from others — for Perth, Melbourne Victory, Adelaide and Wellington to miss the six. So with 14 rounds still to play what are we left with? Well, there is the race for the premiership but to many, if not most, the main prize is the championship which comes with grand final victory. If you’re inclined to think along those lines the main point of interest may be the not-quite-so-heady race for finals berths five and six; a race that at the moment appears to be between three teams; Sydney, Melbourne City and Brisbane. The Central Coast and Newcastle appear shot, playing for pride already, an entirely dispiriting scenario. Meanwhile, the Wanderers have parked the bus, it’s now flooded and on blocks and their own fans are banging on the windows, angry and utterly confused.

Some were less significant or straightforward than they seemed, while the themes of the crisis narratives they nurtured – community churn, outward migration, foreign ownership, the inflationary and cultural effects of gentrification - have long been part of the bigger picture in the capital. What really matters, as ever, are the priorities, the politics and the balances of power at play in deciding who gets to live where and defining the best interests of the city and its people. In these respects, the struggles over the Royal Mail Group (RMG) site in Mount Pleasant were the most illuminating. The location is well known to many north Londoners. Standing at the junction of Farringdon Road and Rosebery Avenue at the north end of Clerkenwell, the grand sorting office there has for years been the place you dash to with urgent letters when you’ve missed local snail mail collections. Mail processing will continue on the Mount Pleasant site, but RMG – whose controversial privatisation was an aggravating background factor in this saga – made known at least 18 months ago its intention to create a “residential-led mixed use development” on the adjoining vehicle parking and servicing yards, which straddle the neighbouring Labour-controlled boroughs of Camden and Islington. RMG submitted planning applications to the boroughs’ councils in June 2013. Resistance forces soon mustered. Edward Denison of the Mount Pleasant Association and University College London’s Bartlett School of Architecture damned RMG’s proposal for ten buildings, some as a high as 15 storeys, containing 681 housing units along with office space and shops with a pedestrian street running through it, as an architectural manifestation of the same mentality that informed the Royal Mail sell-off. The plans would, in Denison’s view, result in an “exclusively inward-looking fortress-like development” accompanied by a misnamed “public realm”, which would, in reality, be controlled by and for private interests to create “malls without walls”. Like a cancer, he wrote, this would eventually kill the neighbourhood around it. The two councils were unhappy too, in particular with the amount of affordable homes being offered in the plans for the three hectares of land – 20% of the total compared with the two boroughs’ targets of 50% in new housing projects. Both were set to reject the applications when, in January last year, Boris Johnson intervened. In a wake up call to all who think the powers of London mayors extend only to fiddling with bus fares and making jokes, he took the decision about Mount Pleasant into his own hands. Opponents of the scheme were furious that he did so at RMG’s request. Adding insult to this injury, RMG also lowered the amount of affordable homes they were offering to a meagre 12% on a prime London site they had just picked up from the public for a song. The distinctive element of this episode was the openly pre-emptive nature of Johnson’s move. Normally, some sort of compromise would have been reached in advance by City Hall and council officers behind closed doors. If the mayor was going to formally step in he would have done so only after the councils had gone through their democratic processes. But a statutory 16-week period in which the councils were supposed to have made their decisions on the applications had expired the previous October and City Hall saw no prospect of a resolution. Johnson was defiant, deriding those trying to block the scheme as “bourgeois nimbys” who were slowing down the delivery of new homes in a city desperate for them. He said it was his job to step in to prevent “unreasonable delays” frustrating good schemes. Labour said he was showing his true colours in putting the interests of developers before those of local people. But the Mount Pleasant site’s fate was now to be worked out between RMG and the mayor. The result was announced in October. Johnson proclaimed it a triumph. The affordable proportion of new Mount Pleasant homes had been set at 24% - double what RMG had originally proposed to the mayor and 4% more than it had previously pitched to the unimpressed Camden and Islington councils. But the mayor’s critics turned their fire on the definition of “affordable” – a now familiar issue in London housing rows. Of the 163 affordable homes, 98 would be for “affordable rent” and 65 for shared ownership. “Affordable rent” is a concept introduced by the coalition as part of a new, cut-price model for allocating funds to housing associations and can mean rents as high as 80% of those charged locally by private landlords. In expensive parts of London like Camden and Islington, those local rents can be well beyond the financial reach of people on low and even lower middle incomes. Shared ownership is a category of affordable housing which enables those who can’t afford to buy their own homes to instead purchase a portion of one and hope to increase the size of that portion over time. It is not designed for those at the lowest end of the income scale, who are Islington’s and Camden’s priority. So neither type of affordable home negotiated by the mayor conformed to his critics’ view of what “affordable” should mean if it was to help those of their residents in greatest need. James Murray, Islington’s cabinet member for housing, said Johnson had “twisted” the word’s definition in order to hike the cost of affordable homes to unaffordable heights. The mayor looked at things differently. He stressed that the average rents of the 98 affordable rent homes would be 44% of local market rates – well short of that onerous possible 80% - and that some could be as low as 20%-30% of those rates. Sir Edward Lister, his deputy for planning, pointed out that, at around £360 a week, rents for the larger, three-bedroom, affordable rent units would be very similar to the highest amount of housing benefit that could be claimed in the area concerned, set at £350.95 a week. He was saying, in essence, that families on modest incomes would be able to pay Mount Pleasant affordable rents with a little help from the state. The same could not be said, however, for the less affordable of the affordable rent properties.  Meanwhile, arguments about the design of the Mount Pleasant scheme and its implications for the area remained very much in play. In July of last year Create Streets, a social enterprise research institute which argues that mixed tenure, low-rise yet high density residential streets in keeping with a neighbourhood’s prevailing style can and should be constructed in cities instead of high-rise blocks, proposed an alternative Mount Pleasant plan. This took detailed form in September, claiming to also offer better returns for Royal Mail and a better deal for the taxpayer in the long term. Produced in partnership with the public policy think tank the Legatum Institute, it argued that the site could accommodate more homes altogether – around 730 – centred on a circus design and that the finances would permit higher levels of cheaper housing than were being proposed at the time.  Create Streets attracts suspicion from the left due to its connections with the right-wing think tank Policy Exchange, which has advocated the large scale sale of social rented homes in expensive areas to fund building in cheaper ones. Yet the Create Streets contribution was supported and welcomed by Edward Denison and the Mount Pleasant Association. In what the latter termed “a surprise move”, Johnson described the alternative scheme as “very beautiful” and encouraged those responsible to make their own planning application based on it. Even so, he approved the RMG plan, described by Simon Jenkins in the generally Boris-loving Evening Standard as “a mockery of localism” which “drains whatever character might have been instilled in this potentially charming corner of London”. How did things get to such a stage? At a very basic level is simply astounding that a large piece of London land, until recently in public hands, has somehow ended up not firmly earmarked to contain hundreds of the sorts of homes that the great majority of the London public would surely want built there and in the capital as a whole: homes that are truly affordable to families and individuals on low and average incomes that are pretty to look at, complement local streetscapes and don’t rise too high above the ground. But if we set the vexed question of the Royal Mail privatisation to one side, the Mount Pleasant story also shows how difficult achieving this has become. Johnson could and should have acted differently. Mount Pleasant was an opportunity for a mayoral line to be drawn in the sand, one which demonstrated solidarity with boroughs driving harder bargains with private developers to help meet London’s housing need and which stood up for architectural and community principles which, in theory, the Conservative mayor subscribes to. It is, though, worth reflecting on his defence for what he did: securing163 at least relatively affordable homes is better than securing none; a case can be made that low-to-middle income groups are being damagingly squeezed in Camden and Islington, being insufficiently poor to qualify for those boroughs’ large stocks of social housing yet, if first-time buyers, not rich enough to purchase homes of their own and having to move elsewhere; it can be argued, and later was by Sir Edward Lister, that the councils were never going to get 50% affordable (or even the 40% Islington believes could have been achieved without rendering the scheme unprofitable) and that their reluctance to bend made mayoral intervention desirable if anything was going to be built at all. There are, in other words, compromises to be made and dilemmas to be faced in all dealings with the property trade - and consequences for declining to deal - whichever type of politician you are. The scope for future mayors taking a different approach from Mayor Johnson will continue to be limited in 2015 and maybe for long after that.",profile/davehill,hill,dave
149,2015-01-02T00:00:08Z,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jan/02/death-oscar-wilde-wife-solved,Letters unravel mystery of the death of Oscar Wilde’s wife,culture,Culture,The Guardian,"The sudden death of the wife of Oscar Wilde at the tender age of 40 has long been a mystery. In the 116 years since she met her tragic end, speculative theories have ranged from spinal damage following a fall down stairs to syphilis caught from her husband. Now the mystery may have been solved. Merlin Holland, grandson of the Irish wit and author of The Importance of Being Earnest and Lady Windermere’s Fan, has unearthed medical evidence within private family letters, which has enabled a doctor to determine the likely cause of Constance’s demise. The letters reveal symptoms nowadays associated with multiple sclerosis but apparently wrongly diagnosed by her two doctors. One resorted to dubious remedies and the other conducted a botched operation that days later claimed her life. The letters detail symptoms that progressively robbed her of the ability to walk, riddling her body with pain and leaving her with excruciating headaches and extreme fatigue. Although multiple sclerosis was by then certainly known within the medical profession, the seriousness of her condition went unrecognised. She turned to an unnamed German “nerve doctor”, whose eccentric treatments involved baths and electricity, and to an Italian, Luigi Maria Bossi, who believed that neurological and mental illness could be cured with gynaecological operations. Days after Bossi undertook a gynaecological procedure – having previously conducted an operation which failed to improve her health – she lapsed into unconsciousness and died. Some 20 years after her death, he faced unrelated accusations of unethical behaviour and professional misconduct, only to be shot dead by a patient’s jealous husband. Constance’s brother, Otho, contemplated legal action, but realised its futility. She had agreed to go under Bossi’s knife – against the advice of other doctors. “It cost her her life,” Holland observed. “Ultimately, both Bossi and the hapless Constance met their ends tragically – he by the bullet of an assassin and she by the knife of an irresponsible surgeon.” The Lancet, the leading medical journal, has taken the evidence seriously and will publish a paper on Friday jointly written by Holland and Ashley H Robins, a specialist at the University of Cape Town medical school in South Africa. Holland said he hoped that having the evidence peer-reviewed in the Lancet would put an end to speculation about his grandmother’s death. It brings closure, he says, for Constance, who died less than a year after her husband’s release from prison.    Oscar Wilde, who was imprisoned for homosexual acts in 1895. Photograph: Merlin Holland Archive   Hers was a troubled life. Constance and her brother were brought up by their grandfather after their mother remarried. She married Wilde in 1884 and, after his imprisonment for homosexual acts in 1895, fled with their two boys to Europe, changing their surname to Holland, an ancestral family name, eventually settling near Genoa. The papers include around 130 letters between Constance and her brother, dating from 1878 until her death. Holland said: “While my mother was alive, she didn’t particularly want anyone to have access to letters … She [was] frightened of what, in an age of sensationalising everything, someone might do with them.” One biography refers to spinal injury caused by a fall at her home, while another records a gynaecological operation, but there were few details. Holland said: “People somehow never put two and two together and thought: ‘Why is a gynaecologist operating on her spine?’” The letters reveal that Bossi undertook surgery that involved removing fibroids, or benign tumours. Holland said: “He had totally wrongly diagnosed what was the matter with her – although the fibroids were there, even today, operating on fibroids … is dangerous. In those days … it was an extremely dangerous operation.” The Lancet paper includes passages from her letters. In 1894, she wrote: “I am alright when I don’t walk.” By 1895, her walking had deteriorated, and she reported that Bossi “undertakes to make me quite well in six weeks and I shall be glad to be able to walk again”. But her hopes were dashed. She wrote in 1896: “I am lamer than ever and have almost given up hope of ever getting well again.” In closing this chapter of his grandmother’s life, Holland said: “I rather feel it will put Constance to rest, poor thing.”",profile/dalya-alberge,alberge,dalya

A leaked internal report shows the party’s leader argued that “the key to money for us will be the hedge fund industry” as he addressed Ukip’s executive committee in 2012. He also recounted a meeting with a billionaire businessman in Switzerland as he urged the party to capitalise on improvements in the polls. The documents will be embarrassing for members of the anti-federalist party who have been keen to argue that the Tories are underwritten by the City. In the leader’s report, dated 3 September 2012, Farage reviews the party’s recent successes and says: “It is very interesting. We are very close to the tipping point of being able to do something very very big. “The type of people we are talking to has changed. People who would have slammed the door in our face 3 years ago are inviting us. The key to money for us will be the hedge fund industry,” the minutes say. According to another leaked document, Farage delivered a brutal character assassination of one candidate on the grounds that he would not be able to impress City supporters. He said that the named party member had “no forcefulness and no passion that sticks and registers”, adding: “We could not take him to meet the large City donors.” Ukip has had many successes in wooing donors from the City since 2012. One convert is Andy Brough, the star fund manager at Schroders, who has reportedly joined Farage’s party after growing weary with the coalition government and European attacks on the City. Farage also has the support of the influential hedge fund manager Crispin Odey, whose former father-in-law is the News Corp chairman, Rupert Murdoch. Odey is not a member of Ukip, but threw a party at his Odey Asset Management offices last spring to introduce Farage to potential supporters and donors. Christopher Mills, a co-founder of JO Hambro, a major hedge fund, gave £50,000 in his first donation to Ukip last year. He previously gave to Hastings and Rye Conservative Association and appeared in the Sunday Times Rich List with a personal fortune of £200m. The Tories remain the main beneficiaries of hedge fund firms and their owners. Sir Michael Hintze, a billionaire hedge fund manager, gave £1.5m last year – the biggest single gift to the Tories in six years. Other big Tory donors from the City include James Lupton, Lord Farmer, Lord Fink and Alexander Fraser. Insiders say Ukip’s finances are healthy as the general election approaches. The party outspent Labour for the first time in a national election last May, according to Electoral Commission data published last month. Farage’s party spent £2.96m at the European election, and now sends 24 representatives to Brussels as the biggest British party in Europe. Labour spent just over £1m. A Ukip spokeswoman said the party does not comment on leaked documents.",profile/rajeev-syal,Rajeev,Syal

In an article in Red magazine, the deputy prime minister acknowledged the Spanish lawyer’s connection with the public but added that he also has a “great fan base”. Asked if her popularity was an issue, he said: “We’re husband and wife … I don’t think of Miriam as some sort of PR seesaw. It would literally never occur to me.” In November, the Liberal Democrat leader’s approval rating was just 12 points better than its -65 low in May, after the party lost all but one of its 11 MEPs in the European parliament election. During the same month, the party lost its deposit and came fifth behind the Greens in the Rochester byelection. In the article Clegg also discusses the moment when he first fell in love when they were students in Bruges: “It was total thunderbolt stuff, it really was. “[She was wearing] this dark green velvet thing. And you had what I thought were these quite funny sort of brogue-y shoes on … And I was this pimply Brit, trying to impress her.” González Durántez, a partner of international legal practice Dechert, has been widely described as an electoral asset to Clegg. She has steered clear of the stereotypical role of a politician’s wife, by refusing to trail along during lengthy campaigns. When Sarah Brown and Samantha Cameron became increasingly involved in the 2010 general election campaign, González Durántez said that she would be “willing to help” but would be unable to take weeks off from her work and her family life. González Durántez was also asked by the magazine how much the fallout from Clegg’s unpopularity has affected her. She refused to be drawn, adding: “It would be much more trouble if I was unable to put it in perspective at night ...

152,2015-01-02T00:25:44Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jan/02/steven-gerrard-right-call-ending-liverpool-career,Steven Gerrard makes right call in ending a remarkable Liverpool career,football,Football,The Guardian,"The first thing to say about Steven Gerrard is simply this: he has been a tremendous captain and player for Liverpool. Yes, the deterioration has been sharp and it might be that, deep down, he will acknowledge he has never shaken last season’s ordeal out of his system. Or, indeed, what happened in the World Cup when the lingering memory for those of us in the England press corps came on the final morning, in a windowless room at the Urca training centre, as he slumped in his chair, wearing a week’s worth of stubble and staring into the distance. He was “hurting bad, broken”. It may be that he is still carrying that with him. Gerrard has always been tremendously hard on himself and it will have pained him that his deterioration has been so obvious. He is 35 on his next birthday, on the date of the FA Cup final, and plainly that is not an impossible age to continue for Liverpool when we see Frank Lampard, 23 months his senior, still excelling in Manchester City’s colours. Yet Sir Alex Ferguson once described Lampard as a “freak” because of the way he barely missed a match and applied the same word to explain Ryan Giggs’s longevity. Gerrard has a different playing style: the all-action hero, the leader, the man who would throw himself into tackles and take it upon himself to try to grab a game by its lapels. And age catches up with even the greatest in the end. That is why, among the tributes over the coming days, it is unlikely there will be too many people saying he should have tried to defy the process and remained at Anfield, always to be a one-club man. Gerrard has simply recognised his own vulnerabilities and, however much of an emotional wrench it will be, nothing would have been more galling for him than feeling like he was straying dangerously close to letting down the club he cherishes so much.   Related: Steven Gerrard is the standout player from my whole career | Gerárd Houllier   The proposed move to LA Galaxy and Major League Soccer is perhaps a surprise but, equally, where else could there be at this stage of his professional life? If Gerrard feels he can no longer play with great distinction for a Liverpool side that has been stranded in mid-table this season, it is unlikely (though not impossible) that the current European superpowers would be able to find a place for him. But what a player he was in his peak years. Have you ever seen Gerrard win the league? No, and that will be the regret that pricks at him forever. Yet we have seen him win the Champions League, lest it be forgotten, as well as being the symbol of his team for more than a decade. He is five short of 700 appearances for Liverpool and sixth in their all-time list of scorers, with 180 goals. Gerrard may always feel unfulfilled not to have lifted the Premier League trophy and that mocking Demba Ba song, on the back of his now infamous slip against Chelsea last April, probably hurts him more than he is willing to admit if we remember his emotional reaction after the defeat of City that had left Liverpool on the cusp of their first title since 1990. Eight months on, he will know that Liverpool are not going to win the league on his watch. Yet he should not beat himself up too much when his Liverpool career is hardly short of moments of distinction, including one of the all-time great performances in an FA Cup final. What happened against West Ham in 2006, including a last-minute equaliser from 30 yards, was remarkable, particularly when remembering the awkwardness of his movements as cramp stabbed at his legs. The following year he was voted into a Fifa world XI. “Gerrard is for me, in the position he plays, one of the very best in the world,” Ronaldinho said at the time. “He has a huge impact. For the job he performs, he is one of the greatest.” Yet the people who keep these records reckon that Premier League football is around 20% faster now and the truth for Gerrard is that he no longer has the mobility to belong to the level where he has spent most of his career. His performance against Chelsea in the 2-1 home defeat in early November was one clue. There have been others and Gerrard, that unrelenting self-critic, will not have rushed into this decision. A player of 34 does not rescue the steady path of decline and, overall, it is probably better for everyone at Liverpool that he is remembered for what he was, rather than being clouded by insecurities about what might happen next. And just watch the reception at Anfield after his final game.",profile/danieltaylor,Daniel,Taylor
153,2015-01-02T00:41:01Z,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/02/dead-calm-rewatched-nicole-kidman-steals-the-show-in-high-seas-thriller,Dead Calm rewatched – Nicole Kidman steals the show in high-seas thriller,film,Film,The Guardian,"What would an Australian thriller look like if developed by Orson Welles? The Citizen Kane and Touch of Evil auteur was the first director to film Charles Williams’ 1963 novel Dead Calm, the story of a married couple whose holiday on a yacht is interrupted by a dangerous stranger from a sinking ship.  Welles’s unfinished adaptation, The Deep, was shot in the late 1960s and close to completion but key scenes – such as a spectacular boat explosion during the climax – were never filmed and the lead actor passed away before Welles could revisit it. Rights to the book were acquired in the mid-1980s by Australian production company Kennedy Miller, the team behind the Mad Max movies (including the upcoming Fury Road). The director Phillip Noyce and screenwriter Terry Hayes reduced an already small cast of five down to three and transformed the dangerous stranger – Hughie, now played by Billy Zane – from a mentally volatile accidental killer to a scheming sociopath. Sam Neill plays John, an officer with the Royal Australian Navy and one half of the couple harangued on the high seas. Neill and Zane contribute edge-of-your-seat performances: poor Neill, alone on a sinking schooner for most of the film, half-submerged in water and rising desperation, while Zane is a dangerously unpredictable bad guy balancing wild bursts of anger and violence with a soft, freewheeling demeanour. But it’s Nicole Kidman as John’s wife Rae who steals the show. Forced to endure the brunt of Hughie’s attacks, Rae is both cool and desperate, calculating and vulnerable, with a strange energy that feels young and tender but wise beyond her years (Kidman was just 22 when the film was released in 1989).    The statuesque redhead is a hypnotic presence, exhibiting hints of the lustful cunning she expanded half a decade later in Gus Van Sant’s comedy-drama To Die For. Dead Calm was the film that brought Kidman to international attention; because of it she was cast in 1990’s puffed-up racing movie Days of Thunder alongside co-star and future husband Tom Cruise. An introductory flashback sequence informs us that Rae and John lost their young son in a car crash; we even see a vision of the toddler hurtling through a windscreen. The couple are spending time on a yacht to figure out a way forward – weeks and weeks to get strong and start again, as John puts it. The hurdle in their way arrives in the form of Hughie, who jumps on board telling a fantastic tale about how the rest of his crew were killed by a ghastly case of food poisoning. Like 1978’s Long Weekend, Dead Calm follows distressed lovers who go on vacation to try and resolve their issues and end up confronting more immediate and tangible concerns. And like The Babadook, it is at least in part about the fear of being a bad parent. Hughie’s character could be seen as a manifestation of Rae’s guilt returning again and again, spectre-like, to haunt her. An early and defining moment in the story is the scene where John visits Hughie’s boat to investigate and makes a shocking discovery, and the stranger wakes up and attempts to break out of the room he’s locked in.  Noyce whips together an airtight-intense juxtaposition between John in a dingy, screaming for Rae to jump overboard, and Hughie busting out and taking control. It concludes with the situation reset to the original dramatic configuration: a man and a woman on one boat and a man alone on another. But the men have switched, and two out of three characters will spend the remainder of the running time trying to switch them back. Noyce keeps the tension simmering away, framing a tight visual package that oscillates between unusually close shots and occasional long range images of the water, capturing the characters’ isolation like existential reality checks.  Dead Calm was in part a blueprint for writer-director J.C. Chandor’s near-silent ocean adventure All is Lost, in which Robert Redford fights for survival on his own sinking ship. It was also a dry run (no pun intended) for Visitors, the 2003 swan song of Australian director Richard Franklin, in which Radha Mitchell sailed solo around the world and lost her sanity.

But the hysteria they provoke stays with us",commentisfree,Opinion,The Guardian,"Just after 7pm on the evening of Saturday 28 May, 1898, a retiree named Daniel Maloney sat in his house in Nicholson Street, in the inner Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy. He was “placidly reading The Argus,” as one journalist later wrote, “by the light of a kerosene lamp on the kitchen table.” His wife had left the building from the rear to go shopping in Brunswick Street. As she walked out the gate, a bomb exploded at the front of the house, smashing down the door, wrecking the verandah and sending a plume of smoke soaring into the air. Understandably, the Fitzroy bomb blast caused a sensation across Australia, so much so that the next day “visitors came from all suburbs and loitered about Mr Maloney’s house watching it as intently as if they expected the whole crime to be re-enacted for their especial benefit.” Eventually, some 200 rubberneckers gathered on the grass plot where Bell and Nicholson streets intersect, just to stare at the damaged building. From our perspective, the aftermath to that now-forgotten incident seems both immediately familiar and yet weirdly off kilter, a useful prism through which to re-examine responses to political violence today. For instance, the contemporary reader can’t help but be struck by how, though the editorialists of 1898 unhesitatingly ascribe a political motive to the Fitzroy bombing, not one of them mentioned terrorism. Back then, of course, the word’s connotations were different.     ‘The fellow wore “the soft black hat which is generally supposed to be the outward and visible sign of anarchy”.’ French anarchist Georges Cochon (1879-1959). Photograph: flickr Photograph: flickr   For the political writer of the late 19th century, “terror” and “terrorism” retained their association with the policies of Maximilien Robespierre and the Jacobin party during the French Revolution. In everyday use, the term “terrorism” had evolved to include violence or threats used to sway opinion but it tended to refer to the actions of a state (or at least a collective) rather than the deeds of an individual: hence, in 1898, Sydney’s Sunday Times was bemoaning the “extent to which the larrikin pushes of the city still exercise a terrorism.” Nevertheless, even if the label was different, the response was the same: the Nicholson Street bombing was generally understood as a local manifestation of an international campaign of political violence. After all, just three weeks earlier, a similar blast had detonated in a lane off Napier Street at the residence of a Mr Underwood (whom The Age described as “an Israelite, engaged as a carrier for John Terry and co., the well known timber merchant”).  Many feared Melbourne faced a bombing campaign. The immediate suspects were not, however, Muslims, but anarchists. What we would now call the anarchist terrorism of the 1890s has been largely forgotten. Yet in no other period have as many heads of state been murdered as during that brief spate of time, with Sadi Carnot, president of France, killed in 1894; Antonio Cánovas, prime minister of Spain killed in 1897; the Empress Elizabeth of Austria in 1898; King Humbert of Italy in 1900; and US President William McKinley in 1901. The assassinations of political leaders were accompanied by other, less discriminate attacks, such as the bombing of Paris’ Chamber of Deputies in 1893 and the Café Terminus in 1894, and then, most bloodily, the explosion at the Barcelona religious procession in 1906 that killed 23 people.  Politically, the ideas of the anarchist bombers could not have been more different from those of today’s jihadis. For one thing, most of them were avowed atheists.  The Frenchman Ravachol, perhaps the most famous of the dynamitards, inspired a popular song (with the chorus: “Long live the sound of the explosion!”) after he threw an “infernal machine” at a judge notorious for his treatment of political prisoners. On the way to the guillotine, Ravachol chanted: “To be happy, God damn it, you have to kill those who own property! To be happy, God damn it, you must cut the priests in two!”  Later, when Emile Henry, an admirer of Ravachol, tossed dynamite into a fashionable restaurant, a prosecutor wondered how he justified killing random patrons.  “We will not spare the women and children of the bourgeois,” Henry snapped, “for the women and children of those we love have not been spared.” The resemblance between that sentiment and the justification given by the Pakistani Taliban for school massacres (“If our women and children die as martyrs, your children will not escape,” explained Taliban leader Umar Mansoor) should give pause to those who understand contemporary terrorism as specifically Islamic or solely religious. The scholar Richard Jensen reminds us that the “age of of anarchist terrorism coincided with the beginning of the age of mass journalism”. He notes how Randolph Hearst’s Evening Journal employed the still-developing conventions of tabloid publishing to cover the killing of Empress Elizabeth on 10 September 1898:   A giant headline stretched across the entire top of the front page, ‘AUSTRIA’S EMPRESS FOULLY ASSASSINATED BY AN ITALIAN ANARCHIST’, accompanied by a large sketch of a youthful and attractive crowned head in a low-cut evening gown.      The arrest of Ravachol: “Long live the sound of the explosion!” Photograph: James Vaughan/flickr Photograph: James Vaughan/flickr   Australia might have been thousands of miles from the most prominent anarchist attacks but the local papers followed the bombings assiduously: in a survey of one Australian newspaper from October 1893 to 1 May 1894, the historian Bob James found no less than 67 leading items or editorials on “anarchist outrages”. Thus, when news broke of dynamite in Nicholson street attack, the reporters were already primed to uncover a plot, even before police found the word “Anachy” (sic) scratched into the bomb casing.  The Age recalled how, during the previous year, posters had appeared (“the work of some irresponsible fanatic,” they explained) on local telegraph posts and lamp poles, “set[ting] forth in wild and unreasoning phrases the advantages of Anarchy.” But why would an anarchist target a retiree and his family? In response to that baffling question, speculation mounted that the real target might have been a certain Cornelius Crowe, an ex-policeman living nearby who operated a private security or “night patrol” firm. The theory was buttressed by the curious testimony of two eyewitnesses. According to the Argus, a cigar manufacturer called Mrs Spry told the police how, on the night of the bomb, she had noticed snooping around her house a tall man, “of gentlemanly – even refined – appearance”, with fair hair and a drooping moustache. Worse still, the fellow wore “the soft black hat which is generally supposed to be the outward and visible sign of anarchy”.  The following day, this mysterious “refined gentleman” paid another visit.  Mrs Parker, another neighbour, had been discussing the bombing at the gate of her house when a stranger asked her, “Do you know where ex-constable Crowe lives?”  When she told him, he exclaimed “What a pity!” before walking on. Parker described her man as:   [G]ood looking, extremely gentlemanly in his manner and demeanour. His speech was refined and grammatical, though tainted with a strong foreign accent … On the little finger of his left hand shone a gold ring the whole of the time his hand was raised caressing his moustache.  No further trace could be found of the gentlemanly stranger nor his anarchistic trilby, and we might be legitimately suspicious of a description that so closely replicates a by-then well-established trope of the anarchist mastermind: the too-clever intellectual, whose long hair hints at his disordered morals.  You can see already see antecedents of the stereotype in Emile Zola’s great 1885 novel Germinal, which features the nihilist Souvarine: a gentle and sensitive man who plays chess, loves to stroke a pet rabbit … and then dispassionately kills his own friends by dynamiting a coal mine. The Secret Agent, Joseph Conrad’s novel of terrorism, presents a similar figure in the form of “the Professor”, a talented chemist devoid of all human emotions and devoted only to perfecting ever more destructive explosives.    “The too-clever intellectual, whose long hair hints at his disordered morals.” US anarchist and doctor Ben Reitman (1879–1943). Photograph: flickr Photograph: flickr   While Zola based Souvarine on the real anarchist Mikhail Bakunin, he clearly intended the character as a warning: a cautionary tale about the inhuman consequences of nihilistic violence. “[Souvarine’s] anarchism is the expression of a profound and destructive despair,” notes the historian David Renton. “In Germinal, Souvarine’s existence is a futile, wasted life.” Yet, fascinatingly, the Parisian bomber Emile Henry understood the novel quite differently. “I am almost tempted,” he told the court, as it sentenced him to death, “to say, with Souvarine in Germinal: ‘All discussions about the future are criminal, since they hinder pure and simple destruction and slow down the march of the revolution...’” In other words, Henry read what was intended as an expose of terrorism – and then embraced the doctrine it presented. It’s a striking literary instance of a more general phenemon: the peculiar dialogue that played out between the advocates of political violence in the 1890s and the media that denounced them. The anarchist bombers explained their attacks as the “propaganda of the deed” – shocking acts intended by their very audacity to wake the masses from their slumber. The concept implied a certain theory of the media, taking for granted the necessity for spectacular, violent actions to make political gestures newsworthy. Not surprisingly, many of the bombers were obsessed with their press. “Lucheni, who murdered the Empress Elizabeth, longed to get into the newspapers as a famous anarchist assassin,” says Jensen. “Czolgosz, who shot [president] McKinley, slept with a clipping describing the assassination of King Humbert tucked beneath his pillow.” The bombers wanted the lurid newspaper coverage that followed dynamite outrages, on the basis that readers (or a percentage of them) would be attracted to the cause. It’s scarcely surprising, then, that some of their recruits were ignorant of (or indifferent to) the texts of anarchist theory but instead embraced the caricature of anarchist bomber presented to them by a hostile press.  As Jensen puts it:  [I]t can be argued that the wave of anarchist terror that swept through Europe during the eighties and nineties drew its growing strength from a curious combination of the acts of ideologically committed anarchists and of the violent deeds of a miscellany of perpetrators who shared dubious or no connections with anarchism.  The “propaganda of the deed” has, under different circumstances, been embraced by highly-disciplined, ideologically-driven individuals and organisations. The intellectuals who, under the crushing regime of Tsarist Russia, joined the terrorist group Narodnaya Volya were famous for their asceticism, and calmly accepted the death sentences handed to them. Yet terrorism’s reliance on publicity means that it has also always fascinated attention-seekers.  In his interesting book The Skies Belong to Us, Brendan Koerner chronicles the epidemic of skyjackings in the US: 159 planes were taken between 1961 and 1972 – and the vast majority of them toward the end of that interval. This was, he notes, a time when the optimism of the 1960s was palpably being extinguished:  Large segments of the population were aggrieved that words and placards had failed to end the war in Vietnam, or cement the gains of a civil rights movement that was decimated by assassinations. That disappointment quickly mutated into a more pervasive sense of hopelessness, a feeling that no amount of civic engagement could ever salvage a system that had been rigged to serve a selfish elite.  Yet while the skyjackings were, in a sense, avowedly political – many of the planes ended up in Cuba – the skyjackers themselves were a weird bunch: “their ranks included frazzled veterans, chronic fabulists, compulsive gamblers, bankrupt businessmen, thwarted academics, career felons and even lovesick teens.”     Frank Arbano (L), a US dynamiter accused of plotting a “dynamite war against churches and men of wealth” in 1915. Photograph: flickr Photograph: flickr   The comparison with the Sydney siege of late 2014 should be obvious. Throughout his erratic career, Man Haron Monis seems to have yearned to be noticed. He was preoccupied with Islam and politics in the Middle East but his religious and ideological views swung wildly from his initial claim to be a liberal Shiite persecuted by the Iranian regime, to his final presentation as an enthusiast for the Sunni Islamic State movement. Whatever the cause he promoted, he was drawn to flashy stunts, like chaining himself to parliament or writing bizarre and inflamatory letters.  Monis craved attention – and, in today’s climate, nothing gets attention like terrorism. Should we call him a terrorist? In a sense, yes. He was a deeply unstable individual: a conman and a criminal, with a penchant for hurting women. But instability goes with the territory – Ravachol, whose chequered career apparently included a stint of grave robbery, also seems to have been quite peculiar.  When skyjacking dominated the papers, there was a certain inevitability about a percentage of lost or damaged individuals declaring themselves skyjackers. Now, with the media fixated on Islam, we’re seeing a comparable tendency for loners and misfits to embrace jihad, not because they’ve studied the theology of Sayyid Qutb or received training in Afghanistan, but because the rhetoric of holy war offers certainty – and waving a black flag gets them noticed. France, for instance, has recently suffered a spate of what’s been called “lone wolf” attacks. In Dijon, a man screaming “God is great” in Arabic deliberately rammed his car into a crowd, injuring 11 people. Authorities said he had a history of mental illness and had repeatedly sought treatment. In Nantes, the driver of a white van did the same thing. In Jou-les-Tours, a man with a concealed knife walked into a police station and attacked three officers before being shot dead. Now, it’s difficult to believe that the crimes would have taken the form that they did had the world not been reshaped by 9/11. Like Monis, the assailants used the lexicon of jihad. The rhetoric of Islamism clearly shaped the way they understood their actions. Yet what’s at stake in calling them terrorists? What has that term come to mean in this particular context? In the immediate wake of 9/11, the architects of the war on terror warned Western nations to brace for more attacks masterminded by bin Laden and his gang. If the operatives of al-Qaeda weren’t building a “dirty bomb” to take out a city, they were, we were told, plotting to release anthrax into our air supply. Hence the necessity for attacking Iraq and Afghanistan: if we smashed the terrorist chiefs and destroyed their training camps, the leaderless foot soldiers would be unable to implement their schemes. Today, the fear of bin Laden has been transferred holus bolus to the Islamic State (Isis), a group that didn’t even exist in 2001. Tony Abbott says Isis has “declared war on the world”. George Brandis, the attorney general, argues it represents an “existential threat”, more dangerous than that posed by the nuclear-armed Soviet Union during the Cold War.    ‘Throughout his erratic career, Man Haron Monis seems to have yearned to be noticed.’ Photograph: AAP   That’s the problem with simply labelling Monis a “terrorist”: it can be a way of shoehorning the Martin Place events into the same tired narrative we’ve been hearing for 13 years, the one in which Australia must perpetually confront catastrophic danger directed by super villains from across the ocean. In reality, this remains one of the safest countries in the world. Statistically, in the list of dangers that ordinary Australians face, terrorism doesn’t even rate – and anyone who suggests otherwise is a liar.  Furthermore, bin Laden’s dead and so’s Saddam Hussein. It seems most unlikely that Monis had any contact whatsoever with the Islamic State (would its cadre really recruit a self-confessed practitioner of magic?). Nor did he require training from al-Qaeda to conduct his siege – rather, he learned how to use a gun when working as a suburban security guard. He was not an elite operative smuggled into the country on a secret mission but a damaged and perhaps delusional individual, demanding the government provide him with the Islamic State flag he’d forgotten to bring.  We can call that “terrorism” if you like but it’s a very different phenomenon from the one the politicians described back in 2001: an attack not directed from the hills of Afghanistan so much as one auto-generating from the War on Terror itself.  In the 1890s, when the newspapers invoked anarchism, the label came freighted with all kinds of baggage. Anarchism was, the editorialists said, a grand conspiracy that would annihilate all politicians and destroy civilisation, with the isolated attacks conducted with homemade bombs the forerunner of a looming globally-staged revolution.  “When compared with the suppression of anarchy,” explained US President Theodore Roosevelt as late as 1908, “every other question sinks into insignificance.” In reality, the death toll from anarchist violence was far, far less than the press coverage suggested. Bob James argues that anarchists and anarchist sympathisers initiated perhaps 40 violent attacks between 1880 and 1902, and were to blame for 100 deaths throughout the entire world. Furthermore, the notion of some powerful organisation co-ordinating the attacks (along the lines presented in Chesterton’s novel The Man Who Was Thursday) was purest fantasy. Most of the bombers were impoverished workmen, acting alone, Jensens explains:   By connecting together a disparate series of events, many having nothing to do with anarchism, newspapers helped create the “myth” of anarchist terrorism as a fearsomely powerful phenomenon sweeping through the world. Many governments, frightened publics, and vengeful anarchists (as well as those who aspired to the name of anarchist) came to believe in this myth.  The hysteria that ensued sounds remarkably contemporary:  The public flooded the offices of the Paris police with reports of suspected bombs and bombings. The police found themselves carefully extracting suspicious objects from the garbage, taking them to the municipal laboratories and opening them with a thousand precautions, only to discover that the deadly device was no more than a sardine can. The slogan ‘Long Live Anarchy!’ appeared everywhere in the French capital, spoken in private discussions and shouted at public meetings, printed in the newspapers and scrawled on innumerable walls. The police imagined they heard it whenever encountering resistance, although the culprit might be a tipsy railway clerk rather than a dangerous anarchist. In one case police and prosecutor browbeat a seventeen-year-old youth, after he had stabbed a man, into a false confession that he was an anarchist. In other cases robbers willingly cloaked their deeds with the mantle of the anarchist cause, even though this meant a death sentence rather than imprisonment. Once again police and non-anarchists alike unwittingly collaborated in magnifying the anarchist menace out of all proportion to its true size.  The construction of that myth justified all manner of coercive measures, many of which, once again, seem terribly familiar.    An inspector holds bombs recovered from an attempted anarchist bombing of St. Patrick’s Cathedral, New York, in 1915. Photograph: flickr Photograph: flickr   In September 1897, Spain circulated a proposal in which a special island (“either in the Philippines or the Carolines”) would become an international penal colony “where dangerous anarchists could be detained for life”. That Guantanamo Bay for anarchists never came to fruition but the next year Italy hosted, under conditions of extraordinary secrecy, the “International Conference of Rome for the Social Defense Against Anarchists”, attended by 54 delegates from 21 European countries, including Britain, Germany and France.  That event, and a similar gathering in St Petersburg in 1904, insisted on treating anarchism as a purely criminal matter. The protocol from the Rome conference declared that anarchism had “nothing in common with politics” and was not “under any circumstance to be regarded as a political doctrine”, a statement as preposterous as the repeated denial by governments in the 21st century of any connection between terrorism and Western intervention in the middle east.  The understanding of anarchism as a conspiracy spurred a certain kind of response, focussed on unmasking and punishing the ringleaders so as to smash their networks and prevent new ones forming. Yet, in retrospect, it’s clear that the punitive measures being advocated produced an effect entirely opposite to that authorities claimed they intended. Predictably, public executions of anarchists spurred revenge attacks (no less than nine bombs followed the guillotining of Ravachol), which led to renewed crackdowns, which led to more bombings, in the spiral of violence we’re accustomed to seeing today. Historians disagree about the precise reasons for the eventual decline of dynamite violence in most countries during the early 20th century. The most plausible explanations pertain to politics rather than policing – in particular, the development of mass political parties and trade unions offered an alternative model of social change. What of Mr Maloney and the explosive assault on his family home? Alas, that remains shrouded in mystery! Though the police paraded a series of moustachioed men before Mrs Spry, she was unable to identify any of them, and no more was heard of the gentlemanly foreigner. Meanwhile, confronted by the thorny conundrum of how an anarchist mastermind, particularly an educated and gentlemanly one, might misspell the name of his own creed, The Argus eventually conceded that the bomber might be merely a conventional criminal – but then added the scratchings on the explosive (“Anachy”) indicated “the pernicious rubbish upon which his imagination has been feeding”. Which may well have been true, though it was rather an ironic claim from a newspaper that, like all the others, had immediately (and on the basis of very little) proclaimed the blast an anarchist attack. Had the press investigated the real world of Australian anarchism instead of simply denouncing “the weak-witted unfortunates who are prone to talk of anarchy on the banks of the Yarra”, the reporters might have discovered that the dynamite faction never established a meaningful foothold in Australia. Rather, as William Lane explained in his novel Working Man’s Paradise, most of the local anarchists simply believed “that men should live in peace and concord, of their own better nature, without being forced, doing harm to none and being harmed by none”. Indeed, the posters that The Age reported may well have been placed there by JA Andrews, one of the founders of the Melbourne Anarchist Club and someone who made a point of leaving flyers wherever he went. As Bob James documents, Andrews persistently denounced proposals to imitate Ravachol, believing (with good cause) that they were mostly raised by police provocateurs.  It’s possible that the bomb did indeed relate in some way to the ex-constable Cornelius Crowe, a man who subsequently enjoyed a rather chequered career, which included the production of the still-cited Australian Slang Dictionary. He later published a series of inflammatory accusations about police collusion with organised crime, for which he was found guilty of libel.  Could Crowe have been the target – or perhaps (given the repeated suggestions he was a fantasist) could he have planted the bomb himself? We simply don’t know. Maloney repaired his house, which remains intact today: a distinguished looking building in a pleasant and increasingly prosperous suburb. There’s nothing to suggest that crowds once gathered at the site, terrified by a “threat” that most Australians don’t even remember. ",profile/jeff-sparrow,Jeff,Sparrow

Nigel Powell, who as a detective helped the Fitzgerald inquiry expose corruption and more recently worked as a mental health advocate, said the spate of shootings in 2014 was linked to a cultural shift that government reviews would not likely tackle. 2014 closed with the police watchdog still not having received government approval to undertake a “high priority” review after seven shootings in the state, against a total national average of fewer than five a year. Civil libertarians had called for the crime and corruption commission (CCC) to act as an urgent “circuit breaker” to a run of incidents that included four men shot dead by officers allegedly rushed with knives and another shot in the head allegedly while driving a car at police. Six weeks after the CCC sent its research proposal, the attorney general Jarrod Bleijie, who has final say, was awaiting feedback from a parliamentary committee, a spokesman for Bleijie said. Lawyers say the only other independent review, a coronial inquest into the deaths, could take more than a year. Powell, who in recent years also worked for the independent commission against corruption (Icac) in New South Wales, said contemporary street policing bore the psychological impact of the “imported partnership model” of the US. He said this made police more insular, less likely to engage with people on the street, and more likely to resort to force in volatile situations rather than trying to defuse them. “If you look now, we don’t have police patrolling in pairs very much, you have them in groups of three, four and five,” Powell said. “When they’re together, look at what they do: they’re not interacting with the public, they’re chatting to each other and checking their phones. “So when they come across something that’s exciting for some or potentially dangerous – it depends on which one they have foremost in their mind – they’re not seeking to control the incident. “They’re seeking to get a result of one form or another. [But] your aim is not to get a pinch, not to pull your firearm.” Powell said the apparent safety in police numbers had perversely heightened officers’ sense of vulnerability by removing opportunities to hone their skills in defusing potential confrontations through communication. This was in stark contrast to the lessons of solitary beat cops in his native UK, “where you learn very quickly about your vulnerability on your own and how you talk to people”, Powell said. Standard compliance tactics such as yelling instructions and pointing weapons were likely to cause heightened responses in people with mental health issues, Powell said. “You’re not there to inflict your own prejudice to keep yourself fearfully safe when there’s a person who actually isn’t in control of what they’re doing, who doesn’t understand the reality of what’s happened,” he said. “Yes they’ll come out with protocols, yes they’ll have a review. But are they really going to understand and to redefine the way police officers exist on the street? “That’s going to be really hard because that fundamental problem of the average Queensland police officer … is they are so dependent on having one or more officers with them to control a situation and that leads to a sense of personal vulnerability.  “These sort of psychological things are going to be hard for them to examine but unless they can get out of this way of thinking, you’re not going to get too much improvement.”. The mother of one victim has said her son was “psychotic” and “rampant” but questioned why police needed to use lethal force. Griffith university criminologist Ruth Delaforce said the key question around police shootings was how officers were trained to respond to people with mental illness.  But she said recent reforms had also impacted police culture, including changes to entry requirements in 2012 to meet a government election promise for more new recruits. That involved lowering the age limit to 18 years and waiving the need for university degrees or professional experience. Delaforce said the recruiting changes ran counter to a key Fitzgerald inquiry recommendation that the police force be “professionalised”. “You’ve [just] got to be over 18, you don’t necessarily have to have a degree, and therefore there’s more opportunity to acculturate them into those types of thinking which brings you back to pre-Fitzgerald times,” she said. Delaforce said the elevated terror threat could be another factor in police decision making, which would have followed warnings in patrol briefings about “edged weapons” in particular.",profile/joshua-robertson,Joshua ,Robertson

A statement from the governor’s office said he died at home of heart failure, with his family by his side. He had been unwell for some time. Cuomo, a renowned liberal and gifted orator, died on Thursday after his son, Andrew, was inaugurated for a second term as governor. His last public appearance was at an election-night celebration for his son in November. President Barack Obama led the tributes to Cuomo, who was born in Queens, New York to immigrant parents and whose popularity twice made him a possible contender for the White House during a long career in the frontline of politics. He was a “determined champion of progressive values, and an unflinching voice for tolerance, inclusiveness, fairness, dignity, and opportunity”, Obama said, whose life showed that the “country’s success rests on the success of all of us, not just a fortunate few”. Former president Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state, said in a joint statement: “It was Mario Cuomo’s great gift and our good fortune that he was both a sterling orator and a passionate public servant. His life was a blessing.”  “Mario’s life was the very embodiment of the American dream.”  The mayor of New York city, Bill de Blasio, said in a statement: “Tonight, New York has lost a giant. Mario Cuomo was a man of unwavering principle who possessed a compassion for humankind without equal.” In his inauguration address on Thursday, Andrew Cuomo said he had read his speech to his father the night before.  “He said it was good, especially for a second termer,” the younger Cuomo said.

Photograph: Lucas Jackson/Reuters   Cuomo, a Democrat, was governor of New York between 1983 and 1994, losing to George Pataki in his attempt to be returned for a fourth term. He flirted with running for the White House in 1988 and 1992. For the perceived indecision which supposedly once left a plane idling on a runway before he finally decided not to travel to New Hampshire for the presidential primary, he earned the nickname “Hamlet on the Hudson”.  A lawyer by training and profession, in 1993 he also came close to being nominated to the supreme court by President Bill Clinton.    Mario Cuomo with President Bill Clinton in 1994. The New York governor’s reluctance to run for president in 1991 opened the way for his Arkansas counterpart. Photograph: Doug Mills/AP   It was his legal practice that first led him into politics in the mid-1960s when he helped residents fight a city plan to level small scrap-processing plants near the site of the 1964 World’s Fair. Cuomo won the fight and saved hundreds of jobs.  For the next 10 years he repeatedly fought the power structure, winning concessions for residents in housing, education and welfare.  When a law school friend, Hugh Carey, was elected governor in 1974, Cuomo joined his administration as secretary of state. In 1977 he returned to New York City to run for mayor.

Photograph: David Pickoff/AP   He finished a close second but lost the run-off to Ed Koch, who blistered Cuomo’s opposition to the death penalty in what became a long-running Democratic rivalry. He then beat Koch in their run for the governorship in 1982 with heavy support from upstate New York.  His speech to the 1984 Democratic National Convention in San Francisco confirming Walter Mondale as the nominee to take on President Ronald Reagan made his name on the national scene.   Mario Cuomo addresses the 1984 Democratic National Convention.  The speech, which articulated his liberal principles, took aim at Reagan’s economic policies, especially his comments that America was “shining city on a hill”. Cuomo countered by saying: “A shining city is perhaps all the president sees from the portico of the White House and the veranda of his ranch, where everyone seems to be doing well.  “But there’s another city; there’s another part to the shining city; the part where some people can’t pay their mortgages, and most young people can’t afford one; where students can’t afford the education they need, and middle-class parents watch the dreams they hold for their children evaporate.”  His speech defining Republicans as looking out only for the well-off and Democrats as champions of the middle class and the poor propelled Cuomo to the forefront of the party leadership.  Cuomo easily won re-election for governor in 1986 and 1990. He repeatedly vetoed legislation that would have restored the death penalty in New York, and he closed down the Shoreham nuclear power plant on Long Island. He also built 30 new prisons. Under Cuomo, the state budget grew from $28bn to $62bn.

157,2015-01-02T02:59:50Z,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/02/birdwatch-cairns-esplanade,Birdwatch: Cairns Esplanade,environment,Environment,The Guardian,"Out on the Cairns Esplanade, when I look through my telescope, tiny dots in the distance resolve themselves into waders – no fewer than fifteen different species – frantically feeding on the mud as the sea rolls out.The world’s largest wader – the Eastern Curlew, with its impossibly long bill – is joined by godwits and sandplovers, Terek and Curlew Sandpipers, and Whimbrel, each using its specially shaped beak to feed in a particular way. Thus while the curlew probes deep into the mud, the Terek Sandpiper – with a much shorter, upcurved bill – runs frantically around on custard-yellow legs as if the food will run out at any minute. Many of these birds have come a very long way: the Great Knots, Sharp-tailed Sandpipers and tiny Red-necked Stints have travelled all the way from Siberia –as far as 10,000 kilometres. When you consider that a stint weighs just 30 grams – about the weight of a small snack bar – that is a pretty incredible feat. No wonder they are feeding so frantically. All these species are incredibly rare in my home of Britain, so it’s a treat (and an identification challenge) for me to see them – especially so close. As I watch, I can only marvel at the journey they have made to get here, and wonder at their fate. For here on this muddy seafront, ignored by the families and tourists enjoying the late afternoon sunshine, one of the great miracles of nature is happening: the twice-annual journey undertaken by hundreds of millions of birds across the face of the globe.    Twice annual bird migration. Photograph: age fotostock  / Alamy/Alamy   There are three great global migration routes: between Europe and Africa; North America and South America; and the one I am witnessing a small part of here, the Asian-Pacific flyway. As the northern hemisphere summer comes to a close, these Arctic nesting birds head south, arriving here in Australia just in time for the start of spring. That way they never suffer the depredations of winter – for them there’s sunshine and plenty of food all year round. Sounds good, doesn’t it? But as well as the natural hazards these little birds face on their journeys – bad weather, predators and simply getting lost as their inbuilt satnav goes off course – they now have to contend with the changes we are making to their world. Places like the mudflats at Cairns may not look it, but they are absolutely crucial habitats for these global voyagers. Even the landscaping of the beach here by adding sand may already be changing the consistency of the mud beyond, while any development to the port here could render the mudflats useless for these hungry birds. Time may be running out: the Asian economic miracle of the past few decades has already led to massive habitat destruction along the flyway; now that so many parts of this jigsaw have been lost, places like the Cairns mudflats assume even more importance. So it’s good to see that – so far at least – the birds can still find a refuge in this urban resort.",profile/stephenmoss1,Stephen,Moss
158,2015-01-02T03:15:13Z,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/02/welfare-to-work-programs-have-failed-to-reduce-unemployment-says-report,"Welfare-to-work programs have failed to reduce unemployment, says report",australia-news,Australia news,The Guardian,"Welfare-to-work programs promoted by successive governments have had no impact on unemployment as they fail to take into account the changing labour market, researchers have found. The Australian National University (ANU) research, reported in the Australian on Friday, shows that the proportion of unemployed men aged between 25 and 54 has not changed in almost 15 years, staying at 9-10%. Professor Peter McDonald from the ANU’s Crawford school of public policy told ABC radio blue-collar jobs were disappearing. “Full-time jobs for men under age 20 are almost all blue collar, but they’re getting very, very scarce. If you don’t have the skills in this new economy, you’re in trouble,” McDonald said. He said there was a “fundamental structural problem” for low-skilled workers in the labour market. “I’m not suggesting that welfare-to-work programs are not a good idea ... but we need to be looking at the longer-term issue of intergenerational transfer of disadvantage ... kids who leave school, often their parents aren’t working,” McDonald said. Employment minister Eric Abetz said the program was just one strand of the government’s jobs strategy, and that it was working to create more employment opportunities. “I’d encourage anyone who wants to see the benefits of work for the dole to speak to the long-term unemployed who have turned their lives around courtesy of the skills provided by this program. “We know that one of the main reasons employers don’t employ the long-term unemployed people is often because of a lack of work history and work-readiness. The government’s program both provides a reference for the jobseeker and helps to build work-like skills.” The chief executive of Jobs Australia, David Thompson, said the government needed to shift the focus from welfare-to-work programs to reskilling the jobless. “We need to invest not just in training, but also in work experience for these people,” Thompson said. He said service providers were now unable to use government money to put people in training unless it was for a specific job. “The government’s got to get the economy firing so that there are jobs being created,” Thompson said. “We need to be looking at where opportunities will be for training and future employment opportunities.” He said the idea that unemployed people were “bludgers” was “far, far from the truth” and that most jobless people were desperate to find work. Maree O’Halloran, from the National Welfare Rights Network said the welfare-to-work program was “morally wrong [and] doesn’t solve the unemployment problem”. “[The program] is intended to have a shaming effect,” O’Halloran said. “It’s designed to have stigma attached to being unemployed.” She said there were five people looking for every job advertised, and the government should focus on job creation rather than welfare measures. The Greens want welfare-to-work ditched. “The new [social services] minister [Scott Morrison] should study the evidence and abandon this government’s cruel approach and instead focus on investments in better employment services, skills development, case management, education, training and other programs … [That] would deliver far better results than an ideological commitment to work for the dole,” the Greens senator Rachel Siewert said. The work-for-the-dole scheme was introduced in 1998 when Tony Abbott was minister for employment services. Labor scaled back the scheme when it took power in 2007, but never abandoned it. In this year’s budget, Abbott’s first as prime minister, the program was expanded to include jobseekers up to the age of 50.  The government also introduced the Restart program, which gives employers a $10,000 inducement for hiring jobseekers over the age of 50. Senate documents revealed by Fairfax Media show that since July only 510 employers have taken up the scheme, which was projected to help about 32,000 a year. Abetz told Fairfax the government “expects that take-up will increase as employers become aware of the program”. A spokeswoman for the minister said the government never expected 32,000 to sign up straight away, but rather that the budget had allotted enough money to facilitate that number of participants. She said hundreds of people had found jobs as a result of the scheme. A similar inducement program offered under the Labor government, which gave employers $1,000 a year for hiring senior jobseekers, attracted only 230 applicants in its two years of operation. “The Restart program has delivered triple the number of jobs in a quarter of the time compared to [opposition leader Bill] Shorten’s failed attempts with his Jobs Bonus Scheme”, employment minister Eric Abetz said. Labor said its programs focus on training and support for jobseekers. “Tony Abbott has no plans when it comes to creating jobs and getting people off welfare and into work,” shadow employment minister Julie Collins said.",profile/shalailah-medhora,medhora,shalailah

Whether it be the inner-city Melbourne of Helen Garner’s Monkey Grip or the Western Australian coastal setting of any number of Tim Winton’s novels, nothing weds us to an author quite like nostalgia for the days of barefoot summers and vast reserves of Ribena.  Books that fall into this special class can get away with all sorts of syntax problems and clunky prose if the author taps into the deep vein of what formed you, of who you are. Sometimes they are classics you endured at school to re-discover later in life – in my case, My Brother Jack by George Johnston and pretty much everything by Thea Astley – or they are books to stave off homesickness when you have moved to a new city. I can still recall the locations – my bedroom, the family car, the back garden – where I devoured Colin Thiele’s stories. I grew up on the Gold Coast Hinterland and his evocation of the natural environment in his works Jodie’s Journey, Storm Boy and The Sun on the Stubble are unsurpassed.  When I moved to London, I turned not to the works of Chaucer or Dickens, but to Thiele’s childhood stories which I had not picked up for 20 years. They anchored me in my new, unfamiliar world, and reminded me of where home was. To this day, I like to dawdle in the children and young adult sections of bookstores, not because I have a child of my own but because reading passages of my favourite childhood stories takes me back to that phase in my life when pure, uninterrupted reading, that total immersion in the moment, was still possible.  These are not always fond reminiscences, but they are no less powerful or affecting for that. I have a friend who has a fondness for Ruth Park’s The Harp in the South because reading about the run-down brothels and boarding houses of Surry Hills reminds her of her childhood in Melbourne’s erstwhile working class suburb of Richmond. That’s the thing about these books — they are not always homages to the stereotypical Australian beach or bush setting, but are as varied as those of us who have lived them.

Figures for 2014 from state and territory police, combined with historical figures from the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics show the rate of road deaths per 100,000 people is at 4.87, the lowest since at least 1925, when the bureau’s figures begin.    Earlier figures from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau show the rate per 100,000 has never been lower since national records were first collected in 1925. The total number of road deaths in 2014 was 1,155, down from 1,192 in 2013. It is the lowest national number in absolute terms since 1945. The road toll per 100,000 people declined in NSW, Queensland and Tasmania, with increases in the other states and territories.    Queensland’s police minister, Andrew Powell, said his state had its lowest toll since records began in 1952, but while the decrease was a good sign, there were still far too many deaths. “It’s bittersweet because there are still 223 families that are grieving over this festive season,” he said. Powell said better behaviour among motorists, and government initiatives, including extra police and anti-hooning laws, had led to safer roads. In Victoria, police said more pedestrian deaths, drivers affected by the drug ice, and multiple-fatality crashes were behind the first rise in Victoria’s annual road toll in eight years.    Assistant commissioner Robert Hill said two quadruple-fatality and three triple-fatality crashes helped push the toll higher. “We had five collisions, which claimed a total of 17 lives. There were no triple or quadruple collisions in 2013, and I hope we don’t see devastation on that scale ever again,” he said.  Of the 44 pedestrians killed in Victoria, 16 were alcohol- or drug-affected, 12 were killed at night, four were lying or asleep on the road and two were wearing headphones and distracted. “Pedestrians are amongst our most vulnerable road users and, tragically, we have had 44 reminders of that vulnerability,” Hill said. Hill said the danger of drug-driving was clear, with three people killed and four injured when a man affected by ice ran a red light at high speed and hit a car and a pedestrian. He said Victorian police would expand drug testing in 2015, and planned to conduct 100,000 tests by October.",profile/nick-evershed,Nick,Evershed

I had come to ask him about how, in the 1990s, our parish footpaths had been restored, but it was good for a moment to watch him at work and imagine how, long ago, this space with its fire and anvil was busy with carters and ploughmen and horses to be shod. Another forge, up on the main road, had then served the needs of the village, while this one had been the manor forge, working for the squire and his tenant farms. The man who now owns and works the forge, John Cross, former teacher and current church choirmaster, had led the local team that worked on the footpaths, and organised walks to popularise them. Widespread enthusiasm for “the right to roam” had stimulated official action; the Rights of Way Act (1990) sought to strike a good balance between the need of farmers to farm “without undue hindrance” and the right of path users to enjoy the countryside. Local authorities provided definitive maps recording public rights of way, and supplied kits for making stiles, railway sleepers for bridges, and funds – which, in our village, were used to buy tools. On Wednesday mornings, a work party of volunteers would set out to establish and mark the route of each footpath, to clear obstructions, negotiate with landowners where necessary, make new bridges, build or repair stiles and cut back hedges that had thickened and blocked the way. Forty new stiles and 20 two-sleeper bridges were made, and a fondly remembered programme of regular footpath walks began. I recall joining the Boxing Day walk in 1993. Our party of 20 or so soon stretched out across several fields; some walkers were quicker than others, some just more talkative or more absorbed in controlling their dogs, and some more anxious over a bridge or less nimble over a stile. But with watchful leadership, there were no mishaps, and even the stragglers got home before dusk.",profile/johnvallins,vallins,

The chief justice, Tim Carmody, said mistakes by Auscript – a Liberal national party donor which won a contract to transcribe hearings in 2012 – were delaying appeal decisions and creating more work for judges. The judge’s criticism – contained in the supreme court’s annual report 2013-14 tabled in parliament on 19 December – followed state opposition claims that the cost of court transcripts had jumped by 73% after privatisation. The attorney general, Jarrod Bleijie, told parliament a month before the report that the court of appeal “no longer experiences delays in the production of transcripts”. Carmody said it was pleasing the courts had experienced no major delays in receiving transcripts for appeal cases, “unlike last year”. “The quality of the transcripts, however, remains variable, and like last year is often poor,” he said. “Sometimes matters are transcribed incorrectly or not at all. Inappropriate paragraphing is common. “When the accuracy of a portion of transcript is critical to a ground of appeal, it is often necessary for the judges to check the transcript against the original recording.  “Transcripts of appeal hearings are sometimes delivered outside the timelines time set by Auscript. These manifest transcript problems can delay the timely delivery of judgments.” Bleijie told parliament in November the service saved taxpayers $3.6m last financial year. The government has also dismissed any suggestion that $12,000 in donations to the LNP – by Auscript, its chief executive Peter Wyatt and a related company the year it won the contract – played any role amid an “independent, robust and transparent” tender process.  Auscript’s general manager, Kate Gaske, said the company rejected any suggestion that transcripts it provided “are of anything but the highest standard”. “Many of our personnel worked for the State Reporting Bureau under the previous system, and all our transcribers are highly skilled and regularly assessed for the accuracy of our work,” she said. “Auscript’s quality assurance systems are accredited to international standards, and we have met or exceeded every accuracy benchmark contained in our contract with [the Department of Justice].” Gaske said the company was “the recognised world leader in court transcription technology and services” and had “met or exceeded every performance standard for delivery under our contract”. “We understand that the state government’s decision to implement a more cost-effective transcription service has not pleased everyone, however Auscript is simply focused on delivering great results for Queensland taxpayers and the legal system,” she said.",profile/joshua-robertson,Joshua ,Robertson

However, ABC management has confirmed the 774 Melbourne presenter has kept his job and will return to the local radio station after scheduled leave. News Corp newspapers reported on Thursday that Stubbs had been accused of bullying by several female staff members and had apologised in person to a group of colleagues. Stubbs is a veteran stand-up comedian and a TV host and has had a long career in radio – both in commercial radio and on the public broadcaster. He was a regular on Nine’s now defunct variety show Hey Hey It’s Saturday as well as its occasional host. He has hosted the ABC’s local afternoon show in Melbourne for almost a decade. A spokesman for the ABC said 774 management believed the workplace issues had been resolved. “ABC management was made aware of workplace issues regarding Richard Stubbs and undertook an enquiry with concerned staff,” a spokesman said.  “The ABC is satisfied the matter has been resolved appropriately and acknowledges Mr Stubbs’s deep regret for any distress caused to his colleagues.  “He is on scheduled leave and will return in 2015 and is looking forward to a positive year with the team at 774.” On the station’s website Stubbs’ show is described as “cutting wit and clever delivery makes for rapid-fire entertainment”. Claims of bullying in radio stations are not new but the headlines don’t usually involve the ABC. In Sydney, commercial radio shock jock Ray Hadley settled a bullying claim with his station’s website manager last year for an undisclosed sum. Hadley, a star broadcaster on 2GB, was described as a “psychotic bully” by his own boss, in evidence before the NSW district court.",profile/amanda-meade,Amanda,Meade

The Country Fire Authority (CFA) issued an emergency warning for Moyston, a town of about 350 people approximately 220km north-west of Melbourne. A fast-moving grass fire was heading south-east along the Better Route Road towards Moyston, the CFA said. Moyston residents were contacted by phone to tell them it was too late to leave town and to take shelter indoors “immediately”. A number of local roads were closed. The Victorian State Control Centre was unable to confirm reports a house near the town had been destroyed.    For those who managed to escape the path of the fire, a relief centre was set up at the Ararat town hall, on the corner of Barkly and Vincent streets. Ararat is about 15km east of Moyston. “The threat is imminent and the fire is very fast-moving,” a CFA spokeswoman told Guardian Australia.  Eleven water-bombing aircraft and 45 fire trucks were trying to bring the blaze under control.    On Friday afternoon two emergency warnings were also issued for fires in South Australia.  An out-of-control bushfire was threatening lives at Tantanoola in South Australia’s Lower South East region. The blaze, near Mile Hill Road and the Overland Track Diagonal Road, was burning in a forest in a south-easterly direction towards The Bluff and the Princes Highway. The Country Fire Service said the fire may travel towards the town of Glencoe as the wind swings westerly and there was a risk to lives and homes. A bushfire at Humbug Scrub in the state’s Mount Lofty Ranges was also burning out of control and threatening lives. The Sampson Flat scrub fire, near Kersbrook Road, was travelling in an easterly direction towards Kersbrook-Forest Road and Devil’s Gully Road. There was a risk to lives and homes, the CFS said. Residents who were not prepared to actively defend their homes were told to leave if the path was clear, before conditions become too dangerous. Only homes that were actively defended and constructed to withstand a bushfire may provide safety, the CFS said. Victoria is at a heightened risk of bushfire due to soaring temperatures, high winds and possible lightning strikes over the coming days. Temperatures in parts of the state edged over 40C on Friday, with national parks closed down due to the threat of fire. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, said the state was expecting some “very, very difficult days” and urged the public to look after vulnerable people and children. “Make no excuses, it is simply unacceptable to leave a child in a car for any period of time on days as hot as the next two,” he said. “Our emergency services do an outstanding job. They’re ready, they’re well-practised. In these extreme conditions, it’s up to every single Victorian to do the right thing, the smart thing.” Emergency management commissioner Craig Lapsley said high overnight temperatures were expected to create even worse fire conditions on Saturday. “Be attuned for the 48 hours, be attuned about what happens overnight and make sure you understand that it’s not just going to be fires that run in the daylight hours,” Lapsley said on Friday. He told Victorians to monitor several forms of emergency information to ensure they didn’t miss important information in the early hours of Saturday. Temperatures were tipped to stay as high as 28c overnight, before hitting 39c in Melbourne and more than 40c in regional areas on Saturday. Early on Friday morning police arrested a woman over a fire believed to have been deliberately lit in Tatura. Fire crews were called to a grass fire on Craven Road, near the Midland Highway, about 3.20am. The fire was extinguished without incident. Later on Friday morning, a 49-year-old Tatura woman was arrested by detectives from the arson and explosives squad.. Police were investigating a similar grass fire that broke out around the same time on 30 December, and a series of at least 40 grass fires near Tatura over the past year. Tatura is a cattle-farming centre 160km north of Melbourne. It has a population of about 4,500. Detective acting senior sergeant Eric Harbis from the arson and explosive squad said it was lucky there were no injuries or property damage from Friday’s fire. “As we head into the higher temperatures this weekend we are really calling on members of the community to be vigilant and keep an eye out for any suspicious activity with regards to fires,” he said. “These acts can devastate communities so if you see something, say something.” Anyone who witnesses suspicious activity or who has information about fires is asked to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or file a confidential report at www.crimestoppers.com.au.

Only if they stopped being so needy,stage,Stage,The Guardian,"Not many comics have a debut show as successful as yours (What Would Beyoncé Do?!). Did you have the fear when it came to following it up? Definitely, there was a lot of pressure … Doing the previews was the hardest part, as people turn up who don’t think it’s a preview, they’d seen the last show and were disappointed it’s not all-singing all-dancing. I had to explain that it was a preview, this is how it works in comedy. You’re very candid about your sex life and love life, and about body issues. Yeah, it’s a style that developed when I was doing Beyoncé. It’s so important: the best comedy comes from truth, why hide your humanness? I think this is the reason the shows are so popular and hit a nerve. The dialogue between you and your audience continues after the show on social media. What’s the most common feedback you get? They just thank you for being honest, and for talking about things like body issues, and careers, and women in jobs, mental health. They’ve either had friends with these issues or they’ve had them themselves. Mainly it’s the body and careers stuff that gets the most feedback. What do they say about careers? That as a woman it can be difficult to go for what you want, that there are lots of reasons why you’re held back – whether that’s where you come from or that it’s not traditional to go down certain routes. Many comics refuse to retweet praise from followers. Why do you do it? I think I started it because I couldn’t get any industry interest. There was no spotlight on me, but my show existed so I wanted to spread the word somehow. It’s really worked for me, I don’t know anyone who’s built the audience I have with the profile I have. I’ve got no radio or TV profile, no nominations for anything, but people are losing their shit about my shows. They’re the reviews I want, they’re the people I write them for. You talk about dating a lot in your shows – how’s it going? Oh god, I’m giving up on Tinder … I might try Guardian Soulmates, could you get me a subscription? I’ll have a word … I’m just tired of this nonsense, it’s so annoying, I just want a nice man, intelligent, funny. How would you describe your ideal man? I like intelligence, I think that’s sexy. And I like someone who’s got swag. Like who? Which celebrities do you like? I have a rule about never fancying celebrities. The only people I break that for is Shemar Moore from Criminal Minds. Or Patrick Jane (Simon Baker) from The Mentalist. They’re my only two. Would you ever go out with a comedian? I would do if they could get their act together and stopped being so emotionally immature and needy. Congratulations on the part in the Miranda Christmas special. Thank you! It’s only a couple of lines, but then it’s Christmas Day and it’s Miranda so it’s a big deal for me. But at the same time, I’ve been doing comedy for about 12 years, so look how hard I’ve had to work to get my first bit of TV. What would be the dream vehicle? I’d love to have The Luisa Omielan Show; I’d want it to be something truthful and raw and funny and playful and feels like part of an ensemble, with regular guests. Something like Amy Schumer’s show. I want to support women in comedy and I’d love to see a channel take risks. I think there’s a classism and sexism in comedy though, it might not be intentional, but it’s definitely there. They’re too scared to try anything different. The amount of times I’ve been told “we need to put you with two men as you’re a woman” or “we love you but we need to focus on more male-driven sitcoms”. Has that actually been said to you? Yes, absolutely. The industry plays it so safe, and when they do take a risk they end up with Dapper Laughs. That was their risk. Look the other way – audiences are thirsty for my show, I’m selling out time after time, but I have to keep jumping through so many hoops. Just give me a chance to develop something. • Luisa Omielan – Am I Right Ladies?! is at Soho theatre from 2-7 February 2015, with more dates across the UK (for both shows) to follow.",profile/paul-fleckney,Paul,Fleckney
168,2015-01-02T07:00:04Z,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jan/02/payday-loans-caps-fca,Payday loan caps come into force,money,Money,The Guardian,"Well over a million people will see the cost of their borrowing fall now that new price caps on payday loans have taken effect. However, early indications are that many of the sector’s bigger players will be charging the maximum amount allowed to under the new regime, rather taking the opportunity to set their fees below the cap. Interest and fees on all high-cost short-term credit loans are now capped at 0.8% per day of the amount borrowed. If borrowers do not repay their loans on time, default charges must not exceed £15. In addition, the total cost (fees, interest etc) is capped at 100% of the original sum, which means no borrower will ever pay back more than twice what they borrowed, said the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which has introduced the new rules. Someone taking out a £100 loan for 30 days and paying it back on time will not pay more than £24 in fees and charges. Payday lending is a multibillion-pound sector: the Competition & Markets Authority said there were 1.8 million payday loan customers in 2012-13, while the FCA estimates that in 2013, 1.6 million customers took out around 10m loans. However, some lenders quit the market before the changes took place. These include Minicredit, which ceased its lending on 10 December. Consumer organisation Which? said the new regime “comes not a moment too soon”. Richard Lloyd, Which? executive director, said: “The regulator has clearly shown it is prepared to take tough action to stamp out unscrupulous practices, and they must keep the new price cap under close review.” Which? carried out research into the amounts payday lenders were charging just before Christmas, to see if they had cut the cost of borrowing ahead of the price caps taking effect. It found that some of the bigger payday lenders had already brought their charges in line with the price caps. Wonga, QuickQuid, PaydayUK and MyJar were charging the maximum £24 to borrow £100 for 30 days, with default fees charged at £15. When the Guardian checked some of the lender websites on 31 December, it found some had not yet updated their pricing. Peachy.co.uk’s website was quoting a cost of £135 for a £100 loan over 30 days, while Quid24.com showed a cost of £134.70 and Safeloans quoted £130. Which? said London Mutual credit union was the only payday loan provider it looked at that charged less than the maximum allowed under the cap, with borrowers having to pay just £3 in interest on a loan of £100 over one month, with no default fees. Martin Wheatley, chief executive of the FCA, said the new caps would make the cost of a loan cheaper for most consumers. “Anyone who gets into difficulty and is unable to pay back on time, will not see the interest and fees on their loan spiral out of control – no consumer will ever owe more than double the original loan amount,” he added. However, it appears the new regime will not spell the end of the huge annualised interest rates quoted on payday loan websites. Despite the changes, Wonga is still able to charge a representative APR of 1,509%, while QuickQuid’s site was promoting an APR of 1,212%. New rules covering payday loan brokers have also taken effect after the regulator was deluged with complaints over practices such as imposing charges that consumers often knew nothing about until they checked their bank account. These firms cannot now request an individual’s bank details or take a payment from their account without their explicit consent first. Payday loan brokers will also have to include their legal name, not just their trading name, in all advertising and other communications with customers, and state prominently in their ads that they are a broker, not a lender.",profile/rupertjones,Rupert,Jones

You could argue that with a pedigree like that nothing could have gone wrong, but it doesn’t work like that. Although you can maximise your chances of being able to conjure it, charm is ineffable, alchemical. You can’t measure it out by the yard and cut it off when you’ve got enough. You can’t splash it on to a scene and then stopper it to make sure you’ve got enough for the next take. It just … appears, if you’re careful and if you’re lucky. And then it ripples through your film, or your play or your book, animating all and subtly transforming everything from a prosaic good – or even great – into a thing of wonder. Hoffman played Mr Hoppy, a quiet man who nurses both the Babylonian garden on his balcony and a secret love for his radiantly lovely and lively neighbour Mrs Silver (Dench) with equal passion. They have known each other for five years. He has not yet mustered the courage to ask her up to his flat for a cup of tea. Then she gets a tortoise, Alfie, for company (“My Facebook status – ‘widowed’,” she explains to Mr Hoppy. “My Facebook status is … ‘Not on Facebook’,” he replies pensively), and becomes anxious about the creature’s slow growth. Mr Hoppy devises a scheme involving a made-up Bedouin chant, the purchase of 100 incrementally bigger tortoises and a Heath Robinsonesque contraption with which to lift Alfie up to his flat and replace him with a larger successor every few weeks. Everything about the film is beautiful. Every line shines, every moment is polished, the slight plot unfolds smoothly and sweetly – everything is done to a turn. Corden is warm and uncynical without becoming dull or twee. Dench is on almost literally sparkling form – the story lives or dies by her ability to twinkle as mesmerisingly for us as the book’s Mrs Silver does for Hoppy – and Hoffman is … well, just perfect. I simply cannot tell you how perfect. Tiny little flickers of his slightly tortoisey face tell us of his boundless love, his goodness, his patience, his shyness … Oh, he is everything wonderful. But verily, by the brilliance of its smaller players shall ye truly know a top-quality product and everyone here nails it, from the little boy who first twigs what Mr H is doing, to the two pet-shop owners from whom Hoppy sources the tortoises (Geoff McGivern, assuring Hoppy that “all the big money’s in guinea pigs these days”; Jimmy Akingbola offering to shave a hedgehog to mimic the necessary: “I’ve done it before. No one would ever know.”) Just watch it. Once a week, I’d recommend, for the rest of your life. After deep consultation with the family archivist as he basted another festive joint and stirred another 10-gallon jug of gravy for his ceaselessly gluttonous kin, I can say with confidence that the Mangan family have been loyal followers of the World’s Strongest Man (Channel 5) competition for at least 32 of that shrine to musclebound insanity’s 37 years of existence. In the beginning were just a few words and then a lot of truck- or aeroplane-pulling until someone from Iceland won. Over the years, the competitors and the competition have become increasingly bloated. This year’s coverage ran to 11 hours. Fortunately, the Mangans’ love for the lardy men – the existence of whose high-functioning musculature beneath a heavy coating of fat must be largely taken on trust – and the event has grown commensurately. We watched the whole thing, including the final. The log carry, the car carry, the Atlas stones, the improbably-sized barbell-lifting … gosh, it was exhausting. But as with The X Factor, the Breaking Bad box set and sex, you keep at it because you know the end and a fine sense of achievement will come eventually. My personal WSM philosophy is always to bet on the man with “Thor” in his name, so you can imagine my delight when Hafthór “Thor” Björnsson from Iceland got through. Alas, despite his country’s domination via the matchless Jón Páll Sigmarsson in my youth (and Magnús Ver Magnússon through my teenage years, thanks to some hard training in the months when he wasn’t chairing Mastermind), my man had to settle for second place, behind Žydrūnas Savickas from Lithuania. But after 11 hours and 17 bottles of Baileys, it was a result we could all live with. Come back and hammer him next year, Thor. We’ll be there.",profile/lucymangan,Lucy,Mangan
170,2015-01-02T07:00:05Z,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/02/english-radicalism-william-blake-politics,English radicalism needs to recapture the spirit of Blake,commentisfree,Opinion,The Guardian,"Not since the late 1960s has the gap between imaginative and practical politics – the politics of the soul and the politics of the brain – been as great as it is today. Most attempts to bridge the gap, as in the 1960s, are fantasies, doomed to fail in the short run. Yet the gap is a reprimand. It wounds our shared life. Britain faces this divide in a particularly difficult way. In one part of the country, Scotland, the gap between imaginative and practical has narrowed. Many Scots feel close to living the political dream. Elsewhere, and in much of England in particular, the gap remains immense. The implications of this divide for the British project are very threatening. Faced with the continuing rise of Scottish radical feeling in the old year, how should the English progressive respond in sustained ways in the new one? The most important answer as 2015 dawns is to respond a lot better than in 2014. A more romantic answer, stimulated by a visit this week to the current William Blake exhibition in Oxford’s Ashmolean museum, is for English politics to somehow reawaken the spirit of Albion. This may seem a quixotic suggestion for a country facing a tough and gritty general election year. But the 2015 election will be tough and gritty, in part, because such questions have been much neglected. The political wing of the progressive project in England has become almost wholly detached from the imaginative wing. The prospects for a sustained revival of the progressive cause in British politics will remain hugely handicapped until the two are brought into closer harmony again. Let us get rid of one issue right away. The rise of Ukip is not the English equivalent of the rise of the SNP in Scotland. The two parties have flourished for some related reasons, but no English radical or progressive identifies with Ukip in the same way that so many Scottish radicals and progressives have currently embraced the SNP. Those who pretend that Ukip is in some sense the true voice of English feeling and of the English disadvantaged are deluding themselves, and us. How, though, does a distinctively English radicalism find an authentic voice which can simultaneously offer a coherent alternative account to Ukip south of the border, reanimate the English progressive movement from liberal across to labour in the way that nationalism has done in Scotland, but at the same time speak across the border to Scotland in non-nationalist terms which make shared sense within a working British state? This is a big question, largely unaddressed by civic England, insofar as such a thing can be said to exist. Getting the answer right matters enormously for the future of shared English life. But it also matters because the English progressive tradition urgently needs to find a way of communicating convincingly with Scotland – and Wales and both parts of Ireland too – in shared not confrontational terms. Without this, the nationalist fantasy – that Scotland’s problems will be solved by throwing off the English yoke – will only prosper. English progressivism has failed to find a true and consistent voice of its own for two main reasons. The first is because too many now see the solution to the UK’s disjunctions in purely instrumental terms. Give England its own parliament, say some. Regional devolution is the answer, say others. Revive local government. Cap it with a federal upper house at Westminster. Once this is done, the argument runs, the current constitutional and democratic asymmetries — and the grievances to which they give rise — will have been dealt with. This isn’t wholly wrong. A version of it is largely right. But the problem facing English life is not primarily constitutional. It will not be solved even by the most perfectly designed systems of government. The larger problem facing civic England is cultural and imaginative. It is about better articulating English feeling in a progressive, open and modern yet vernacular way – if such a thing can be done – and then reuniting it with practical, achievable politics. English progressivism is confused about this. It fears that English feeling is, not very deep down, reactionary and supremacist. It fears that attempts to give England a national voice will be eclipsed by dark forms of Englishness that are marked by racism and xenophobia, and by post-imperial and triumphalist nationalism. Progressivism fears the lordly and the lumpen alike. But it also fears the rural and parochial. These issues cannot be merely wished away. But the choice facing English progressives is whether to bow the knee, and accept that the English people are part of the problem; or whether, bit by bit and by an imaginative effort, to promote a different better and richer national feeling in which the English people are part of the answer. Which is where Blake and the spirit of Albion come in. Blake himself does not provide the whole answer. But he stands, in this argument, for a tradition that matters. He possessed in spades the things without which any progressive project will always eventually founder. He had an imagination. He was a dreamer. He was impassioned. He loved the land as well as the city. The injustices of the world caused him to weep and made him eloquent. He was a rooted and historically aware English radical. And yet politics was not the focus of his rich life. True, Blake was a man of his times, not ours. True, he was a one-off. True, his visionary world was expressed in myriad ways that were wholly his own. He was as far from being a practical politician as it is possible to be. You would never want him to run the railways or the NHS. Yet he had a vision of humanity that still connects to the digital age. What Blake embodies more than anything else is politics as a form of religious faith, not politics as system or science. We inhabit a world in which politics is calculated, targeted and practical, constrained by the possible, fearful of failure and inevitably modest in its goals. Blake stands for a completely different, idealised vision of politics. He is the poet of that part of the progressive organism that dreams of heaven on Earth, building the new Jerusalem, the new moral world and a restored Albion of free and equal imaginations. In one sense, well articulated by Tony Blair this week, all this has nothing whatever to do with success in practical politics. Blake’s visions won’t win the election. Yet without some form of that vision, practical politics is as dry and distant as so many now believe. Without the dream of Albion, how can England arise and Britain come together again in the common cause?",profile/martinkettle,Martin,Kettle

In 2000, the country began making primary education free; a decade later, in 2010, it became compulsory. Now the country is trialling a startup that sends homework to pupils via mobile phone. Sterio.me sends homework lessons and quizzes to basic phones that have limited access to data. Phones of this type have more than 86% penetration in Lesotho. The programme is undergoing trials in local schools, supported by the Vodacom Foundation, the ministry of education and the local teachers’ union, before being rolled out across the country.  The project was started by Christopher Pruijsen, Danielle Reid and Dean Rotherham during the 2013 StartupBus Africa hackathon, run by ampion.org. “We originally saw the potential to use something as simple as a mobile phone to deliver powerful information, especially across literacy, internet access and device barriers,” says Pruijsen, now CEO of Sterio.me. “We also wanted to make sure that the experience was simple and effective for teachers, by saving them time creating, distributing and marking homework.” The Sterio.me team generates homework and quizzes for teachers, with the content relevant to what students will be learning in the next term. The teachers approve the content before the school year starts. “We can say that, as of December 2014, we have more than 1,000 questions across the Lesotho junior secondary curriculum, approved by active local teachers,” Pruijsen says. Currently, the curriculum covers maths, geography, English and agriculture.  When the programme is running, students receive a call covering the day’s work. A text-to-speech programme reads out several multiple-choice questions that the pupil can answer using the phone’s keypad.     The Vodacom Foundation is paying for the airtime for the Sterio.me trial, making the system free to schoolchildren.  Photograph: Sterio.me   The collected data is fed back to improve learning outcomes, teaching methods and the school curriculum. Teachers can see the data in real time, checking which pupils have completed assignments and monitoring their progress while also seeing where they could improve their teaching methods. To aid with policy formation, the data is accessible to government agencies.  The Sterio.me team hopes to use the collected data to filter for cheating. “With any type of out-of-classroom or remote form of learning and quizzing, there is a risk of cheating – paper-based homework is the same,” Pruijsen says. “We believe that with the wealth of data we will gather via mobile engagement of the students, both via voice and SMS, we can use big data analysis to filter for ‘high risk of cheating’ scenarios, such as when students who normally take a longer time to respond suddenly take 0.1 second to input the correct answer. We can also scramble the order of correct answers, so that the correct answer for one student might be the ‘1’ key on a given multiple choice quiz, and for another student it would be option ‘3’. “For the moment, feedback from students has been so positive that we trust they will complete the quizzes for their own personal benefit, as they are motivated to improve their education and with this their opportunities at a better life. Students are looking to improve their own comprehension and are excited about new ways to do that.”  The project has been a work of passion for the team. “We’ve done everything to make the concept a reality, from sleeping on couches for months to taking on personal loans as founders, all to make Sterio.me a success,” Pruijsen says. In its Lesotho trial, the Vodacom Foundation pays for the airtime, making the system free for students.  The team hopes to extend the project’s reach to mobile English language learning in Asia and Latin America, and to expand its basic operation globally. ",profile/dan-griliopoulos,griliopoulos,dan

I am a bit of a rebel. We immigrated to Australia when I was 13 and I went to university there to study computer science when it was all very new. However, I dropped out at the end of the first year after deciding that London would be much more fun. I told my parents I was going to the beach for a weekend but got on a plane. I did call them when I got here, though! I ended up in the computer industry. I eventually started teaching computing part-time in various colleges, even Wormwood Scrubs, before taking a full-time post at South Thames College and then South Bank Polytechnic. There I started an artificial intelligence laboratory, which grew to 22 people. This led to consulting in the US where I met Eric Schmidt, now Google’s executive chairman, but then head of the software division at Sun Microsystems. When he offered me a job I jumped at the chance to move to Silicon Valley where I stayed for six years. I missed the UK and Europe, so I came back in the 90s and started my own consulting company; I’ve been its CEO ever since. At Bactest we turn high technology into products. Our latest is Shepherd, our 18th product to market. I never did get that degree, I never had time! How do you invent a product?   Find an overwhelming problem and build a solution. That’s what we’ve done with Speedy Breedy and Shepherd. Both are disruptive products that solve big problems, so the markets for both are large. I have always been keen on building strong businesses with intangible assets that make them valuable. We try hard to build a strong patent portfolio around our products to keep the competition out. We brainstorm with our patent agents to build patents into the product during its development rather than waiting until it’s done and then wondering what intellectual property we might have to protect. It’s a pro-active approach I like a lot. We also work a lot with customers while the product is in its early stages to make sure we are building something they want to buy. I think the best product developers are creative analytics. Then, of course, there is tactical marketing which we start three months or so before launch to build the brand and get early sales. Those first sales are the hardest and the most precious. What’s been your biggest challenge when starting/building your business? Raising funds over the last few years has taken a huge amount of work. Since December 2011 we have raised £2.9m and, like most start-ups, we were fundraising and building products at the same time. When we brought Speedy Breedy to market we were just four people doing the work of 12 - but that’s life in start-up land. What’s next for you and the company? For me I am looking forward to a successful product launch of Shepherd in 2015 and also expanding the distribution channel for Speedy Breedy to 100 global distributors. For the business we are working to get to profitability and seeking to find corporate partners and investors. 2015 will be a big year. Who are your role models and why? Winston Churchill. What a man and what a life. A true polymath, a soldier, politician, poet, author and, of course, artist. When I have a lot on my mind and can’t sleep I wonder how he managed when he knew his boys were dying. It makes my problems seem insignificant and my own attempts at painting look naive (which sadly they are!). I admired Steve Jobs for his total dedication to perfection and, of course, Da Vinci, another polymath who could create both fabulous art and technically beautiful things.",profile/lottie-o-conor,o'conor-lottie,

Eight resolutions every PR should make in 2015",media-network,Media Network,The Guardian,"2015 is already shaping up to be huge. From the general election and royal baby to the Rugby World Cup and a new Star Wars movie, whatever your PR specialism, it’s going to be a busy year. While the final weeks of 2014 have been spent drafting new year’s resolutions copy for clients, you’ve probably not had chance to reflect. So, to save you the hassle, here are eight resolutions any PR will need to make 2015 their year: Ditch the creativity Thinking outside the box was so 2014. While creative ideation experts might try to convince us otherwise, we all know that the best ideas come when we’re alone, minutes before deadline, wired with caffeine. But, in an era where the process is everything, any PR worth their salt needs to at least play along with the notion of collaboration. 2015 is the year to embrace the brainstorm for what it is – group therapy with a flipchart – and save your real critical thinking for your alone time. Know your audience PRs should live and breathe the organisations they represent. You might have tried a bit of client immersion in the past, but 2015 is the year to go full-on Meryl Streep with your work. Starting on a young adult alcohol brand? Unleash the method actor within and spend a week re-engaging your inner youth – listen to One Direction until you know all the words to their album tracks, read The Hunger Games again, go drinking in the park. It probably won’t make your work any better, but it could help you snag a Chartered Institute of Public Relations (CIPR) award. Talk the talk Touch base, flag up, check-in, sell-in, reach out, close of play … You’ve tried long enough to avoid using PR-speak, but you’re fighting a lost battle. Sure, these phrases don’t really mean anything, but hamming up the industry lingo is guaranteed to boost your clients’ trust in you and make your senior management team take notice. Use it enough, and you might start to believe in yourself too. Embrace the next big thing, again If there’s one thing we can guarantee in 2015, it’s that another viral craze will come along demanding we degrade ourselves on one digital platform or another. Probably in the name of charity. As a professional bandwagon jumper, it’s key you’re one of the first to get involved. Or at the very least not the last. Kick it all off in January by finally doing your ice bucket challenge. Tweet/post/blog/vlog/Vine more In the same way a falling tree makes no noise unless you’re there to hear it, your hard work means nothing without a trail of online updates. The trick to curating a strong professional feed is dishonesty. You don’t need to read articles before you share them, just make sure your post is snappy and includes a touch of personality, eg “Interesting read … ” or “Great piece from @PRWeek … ” Looking like you enjoy your job is also key; in-jokes and group photos will help build your online brand, even if you hate your colleagues. Update your LinkedIn Remember the intern who stopped by for a few days last summer? They were someone’s client’s nephew, or something. Well, they have a better LinkedIn profile than you. Seriously. They could barely get a coffee order right, but from their profile you’d think they were more accomplished than David Karp. With top companies trawling the site for talent, it’s time to embrace the cringe. Add pics, join groups, and list skills – both abstract (creativity, team work) and specific (flirtatious Gchat-ing, ring-binding, passive-aggressive email writing) – then watch as the job offers flood in. Get a new headshot A picture speaks a thousand words and, let’s be honest, yours isn’t saying much. Headshot day might drag, but if you don’t nail at least one, you’re going to regret it long after that amateur photographer packs up his kit. Unleash your inner Ariana Grande and demand a reshoot in Q1. Insist on picture approval before your session is up. No folded arms, no awkward leaning, and, ladies, no statement jewellery. Simply turn to your best side, stare down the lens and make that camera work for you. Rise above the day-to-day 2015 is the year of big picture thinking. Avoid getting bogged down in too much of the nitty-gritty by becoming an expert in delegation. The key here is in packaging it up as empowerment. Empower your juniors to take more ownership of admin. Empower your seniors to use their specialist knowledge. In no time at all, you’ll have empowered your way to a clear plate and have more time to focus on improving your own skillset.

Australia and the US were the only two countries that voted against the resolution this week. Eddie Zananiri, who has represented the Palestinian community at meetings with the Palestinian ambassador to Australia, said: “[The vote] reinforces a feeling by the community that this government is anti-Arab.” “The government opinion on Palestine does not reflect the majority view of the Australian public, including the Arab community.” Relations between the community and government are already tense, Zananiri said, citing the Coalition’s failed attempt to relax section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act and moves to call East Jerusalem “disputed” rather than “occupied”. Zananiri said the government was not listening to community concerns about these issues, criticising its “closed-door policy”. The Australian National Imams Council also called for more dialogue. Australia’s grand mufti, Ibrahim Abu Mohamed, said: “I would like to reiterate the message that we conveyed to the honourable foreign minister, Julie Bishop, when we met with her in September: Australia must take a balanced and just approach to the Palestine-Israeli conflict. At the moment it is blatantly one-sided.” “The Australian government cannot champion human rights on the global stage yet turn a blind eye to the injustices and crimes committed against the Palestinian people,” he said. Australia’s ambassador to the UN, Gary Quinlan, said Australia was committed to peace between Israel and Palestine but added that the UN resolution “will not help this process and that is why we have voted against it”. “It lacks balance and seeks to impose a solution put forward by one party alone. Final-status issues can only be resolved between the two sides,” Quinlan said. Bishop George Browning, the head of the Australia Palestine Advocacy Network, said the vote “achieves nothing except to undermine moderates and strengthen extremists on both sides”. “By voting against Palestinian statehood the government is in danger of giving an invaluable gift to extremists throughout the Muslim world who never tire of pointing to the west’s double standards regarding Palestine as proof of its hostility towards Islam,” Browning said. The Arab Council’s chief executive, Randa Kattan, said the vote “would hurt relations to some degree” because the issue was of such great significance to the community. “Every meeting the Arab Council has had with the government … Palestine is the top of the agenda,” she said. The Israeli embassy in Canberra welcomed the vote. On Tuesday, a spokeswoman for the embassy told Guardian Australia that “accepting the proposed resolution would do nothing but harm chances for peace and undermine hopes for a better future for Palestinians and Israelis alike”. “We commend the Australian government for its level-headed vote, which characterised Australia’s time at the UN security council ending today, and call for the Palestinian authority to return to the negotiation table,” she said. Guardian Australia contacted several Australia-based Israeli community groups for comment. ",profile/shalailah-medhora,medhora,shalailah
176,2015-01-02T08:00:06Z,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/02/families-in-literature-bagthorpe-saga-helen-cresswell,Families in literature: the Bagthorpes in The Bagthorpe Saga by Helen Cresswell,books,Books,The Guardian,"Up to the age of 12 or so, I tended to sort the families I encountered through reading into two categories: those I’d like to belong to, given the chance, and those I really wouldn’t. Retrospectively, the impulse isn’t particularly hard to fathom: the child of divorced parents myself, when it came to fiction, I was in the market for stability; the families I fell for were those in which arguments were rare, parents reliable and an unshowy bedrock of love a given. Into the first category, then, went the Marches in Little Women, the Carrs in What Katy Did – and, less piously, the Stantons in The Dark is Rising and the Harrisons in The Ghost of Thomas Kempe. The second played host to the likes of the Wormwoods in Matilda, the Strorm family in John Wyndham’s The Chrysalids, and the aggressively dysfunctional parents in Diana Wynne Jones’ superb Fire and Hemlock, who are, by turns, indifferent, neglectful, selfish and emotionally vampiric (over the course of her career, Jones turned out a fine line in screwed-up families, having been a member of one herself). Of course, there were books that resisted such categorisation; books (many of them) in which the children are orphaned or in which other environments replaced the familial (Enid Blyton’s school stories spring, alas, to mind), but by and large, the system worked. I could appreciate the drama unhappy families generated, but I couldn’t relax around them; much as I might love the books in which they figured, the family interludes themselves induced a kind of queasy panic. This held true right up to the point at which I came across the Bagthorpes. Helen Cresswell published Ordinary Jack, the first instalment in what would become The Bagthorpe Saga, in 1977; the Saga ended up running to 10 volumes, with the last (Bagthorpes Battered) coming out in 2001. Tracing a direct line from Richmal Crompton’s Just William stories, together they furnish a burlesque chronicle of the uproarious doings of the eccentric, sprawling Bagthorpe clan. At the centre of the whirlwind is Mr Bagthorpe, a scriptwriter for the BBC who takes the critics’ reviews of his productions (“monumentally single-minded”; “ruthlessly one-track”) as compliments (“‘Lear is monumentally single-minded,’ he would point out triumphantly. ‘Othello was ruthlessly one-track’”). He occupies his spare moments in pitting himself against his brother-in-law, Uncle Parker, whose delight it is to goad him, and his mother, of whom he says simply, “‘Machiavelli was a beginner. Lucretia Borgia was a novice.’” Alongside him are ranged his milder, more hippyish wife; their offspring, William, Tess, Jack and Rosie; his parents; his sister, Aunt Celia, her husband, the aforementioned Uncle Parker, and their incorrigible four-year-old daughter Daisy – plus Jack’s dog, Zero, Daisy’s invisible friend and sometime accomplice, Arry Awk, her (visible) goat, Billy Goat Gruff, and the Bagthorpes’ dour housekeeper, Mrs Fosdyke, regarded by Mr Bagthorpe as “the ultimate in aggravating and purblind humanity”. Each member of the family (other than Jack, Mrs Bagthorpe, Uncle Parker – who lives a life of careless ease thanks to a considerable income from “something in shares” – and Grandpa, a peaceable man who misses out on much of the drama through selective deafness) considers him or herself to be a genius, and ruthlessly pursues their personal agenda with a fine disregard for the effect of their actions on others. Chaos, inevitably, reigns: the family lurches in lock-step from crisis to crisis, each more outlandish than the last, bickering, apportioning blame and attempting to get one up on each other all the while. The Bagthorpes are many things, but happy isn’t one of them. So how come I fell for them so hard? Part of the attraction, without a doubt, was the humour: these were – still are – among the funniest books I’ve ever read. Cresswell’s masterful characterisation develops over the course of the series to the point where you find yourself laughing in anticipation; the situations into which she pitches her cast (a family holiday to Wales, for example, when Mr Bagthorpe, in pursuit of atmosphere for a ghost-story script, rents a haunted house boasting six ghosts, but lacking such modern conveniences as cooking facilities and hot and cold running water) are overblown to just the right degree, and her set pieces worthy of Larry David. The books also marked my first encounter with the mock-heroic form: Cresswell’s elevation of bourgeois domestic drama to the level of Shakespearean tragedy via her use of magniloquence, inflated analogy and classical reference is so adroit that when I read The Rape of the Lock for A-level, it was both instantly familiar and, frankly, a letdown. For my money, Cresswell did it better. I was attracted, too, by the glamour. The Bagthorpes afforded me my first glimpse of the bohemian middle classes: growing up in Newcastle in the 1980s, I didn’t tend to come across folk who worked as BBC scriptwriters, or wore cheesecloth and did the Times crossword (Aunt Celia), or practised yoga (Mrs Bagthorpe), or ate asparagus (all of them). They seemed to me to be another species, exotic and charismatic. But part of the attraction, I realise now, was the rowing itself.    ‘Perma-feuds and tooth-and-nail altercations’ … the volatile Bagthorpe clan as depicted on the jacket of Bagthorpes V The World, the fourth in the saga. Photograph: Book jacket   At this point, if you haven’t read the books, you’re probably assuming I’m about to reveal that the Bagthorpes’ perma-feuds and tooth-and-nail altercations are a pose designed to disguise a deep, underlying affection, and that the books’ message is something to do with the many different ways of expressing love. Not at all. While the Bagthorpes do, on occasion, close ranks against a common enemy, when it comes to the rows and the rivalry, they really mean it. The question is permanently laid to rest in my favourite of the Bagthorpe chronicles, Absolute Zero, which opens with Uncle Parker winning a Caribbean cruise after coming up with a slogan for Sugar-Coated Puffballs breakfast cereal. The news is greeted with “disbelief, annoyance and downright jealousy” by the wider Bagthorpe tribe, and his slogan, “Get Tough With Sugar Puff”, deemed execrable (“‘I often wonder,’” says Mr Bagthorpe, on hearing it, “‘whether we should have brought children into a world of such colossal triviality.’”) With typical immodesty, the Bagthorpes conclude that, if Uncle Parker is capable of winning a prize with such a third-rate effort, they surely can do better. The entire household succumbs to competition-entering mania, and scores big on several occasions – but the most momentous victory belongs to Tess, who wins a TV contest to find the Happiest Family in England. Her entry to the competition is, of necessity, “a masterpiece of subtlety”. She had, it is explained, “foreseen difficulties should she actually win, and had therefore admitted such things as her father’s shouting and William’s sarcasm, and turned them around so as to make them appear expressions of extreme happiness and affection ... writing the truth in such a way that it came nowhere near to the actual truth.” When the production company lays out its plans to film the Bagthorpes acting happy for a documentary to be aired on Christmas Day, their reactions range from incredulity to horror. “I am not happy,” says Mr Bagthorpe, curtly, “nor have I ever claimed to be.” “‘But you said you wished you were, Father,” Jack reminded him. ‘You said you wished we could be happy like other families.’ ‘So I did,’ agreed Mr Bagthorpe, heavily. ‘Did you ever hear of a story called The Monkey’s Paw?’” So – they weren’t happy. In fact, they argued compulsively and half the time they drove each other round the bend. But happy or not, the books taught me that quarrels needn’t be cataclysmic – could even be a rich source of comedy – and, crucially, that just because a family wrangles, it doesn’t automatically mean the whole edifice is set to crumble. Aged 12, with both parents on second marriages, this was a message I needed to hear. That, plus the inclusion of a scene in which Daisy Parker writes a series of her thoughts on the walls in permanent marker, concluding with the superbly recondite “All the bees are ded”, which still has me snorting with laughter every time I read it, put them top of the tree for me as far as literary families are concerned.",profile/sarahcrown,crown,
177,2015-01-02T08:30:06Z,https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2015/jan/02/carers-online-help-support,Online help and support for carers of all ages,social-care-network,Social Care Network,The Guardian,"The period from 7.00 to 8.30am is a blend of getting myself up, getting the children out the door to school and switching on my computer to see what lies ahead that day. Once I’ve caught up on emails, I have a 30-minute window of dog-walking time to gather my thoughts and get some much-needed fresh air and exercise before settling down at my desk. If I’m today’s on-call manager for our team, one of the first things I’ll do is to check through emails sent out from our helpline the previous day. As an online service, where we’re all working from home, it’s an important part of our safeguarding practices that a manager always looks over the previous day’s interactions with carers. I’ll also see what’s in the helpline inbox for today, to check if there’s anything that the duty member of staff might want help or support with. Providing an email helpline for carers of all ages can bring all kinds of issues: from questions about eligibility for carers’ allowance, to someone offloading about the stresses of caring for their partner, to a 12-year-old being bullied or worrying about how to get a girlfriend; it’s all part of the role. Over the 10 years that I’ve worked for Carers Trust, it’s been great to see how much more awareness there is of carers of all ages, and as a result, how many more come forward asking for information, help and support. I might check in with the duty member of staff, who’ll be taking a look at what’s happened on our online communities overnight, approving new members and answering the helpline, to see if they need me for any support or difficult issues. In a team of home workers, it’s crucial that staff feel supported and part of a real team. Something that really helps us is having a Skype-like system, which enables us to send instant messages or chat verbally. Whether we’re discussing a tricky email or last night’s television, that interaction with each other is a necessary, and nice, part of each day. Today, there’s a phone meeting with colleagues in our London office, to discuss launching our new online service for young carers, who chose the name: Babble. We’re all really excited about this as it brings all the great practice from our existing service at youngcarers.net up-to-date in a fresher and more interactive way, enabling members to find other young people in a similar position, chat, share their stories and hear about each other’s experiences. They can also access information and advice to help them in their caring role. When I trained as a youth and community worker, I never envisaged helping to shape online services where carers from all over the UK could come together to support one another. I feel very lucky to have been part of such an innovative service since its inception. I have quick break for lunch when I try hard to leave my desk and actually sit and read something, before calling one of my team for their monthly supervision session. Again, as we’re based all over the country these are done mostly via our Skype system, with notes written up by the staff member and agreed over email. We discuss projects they’re involved in, any safeguarding issues that they’re concerned about, and whether they’re on track with their objectives for the year. I spend five minutes watching a great vlog about the challenges of caring for someone with mental health issues on our young adult carers’ service, youngercarersmatter.org. They’re a really creative bunch and the things they post always impress and amaze me. After picking up my youngest child from school, with the dog getting her second outing of the day, I’m more or less finished for the day. I keep my mobile phone nearby though, remaining on call for a colleague who’s running one of our regular live webchats at 7pm. Once I know that’s finished, I can mentally switch off, indulge in a glass of wine and some mindless television and look forward to the weekend (when it’s my colleague on duty, not me!).

No rain was forecast. Two fires were already burning out of control in South Australia and fire chiefs warned the state faced its worst days of the season so far. Late on Friday firefighters in Victoria stopped the head of the grass fire that was threatening homes near Moyston in the state’s west, but residents were urged to “watch and act” for further possible flare-ups. In Tasmania authorities issued a state-wide fire ban. Hot and dry conditions were expected on Saturday, exacerbated by wind gusts of more than 50km/h, making any fire that started difficult to contain or control. Temperatures across southern Australia were expected to reach into the low 40s on Saturday, as hot desert air was drawn south-east by a slow-moving low-pressure trough. A cooler south-west change was expected to reach Adelaide by Saturday lunchtime and Melbourne by evening. But while the cool change should end the first heatwave of the summer, it was not expected to bring any rain. On Friday night in the foothills of the Grampians in western Victoria, thick palls of smoke hung over towns and farms. The fire to the south and west of the town had burned out 3,000 hectares of grassland. The Country Fire Authority had 45 tankers and 11 aircraft fighting the fire, and residents had been told it is too late to leave. Moyston guesthouse owner Karen Fraser said the fire raced close to her property, before fire crews cut it off.  “We could see flames in the paddock across the road. We’re very grateful they were able to stop it coming to us.” She said a lack of fuel in the paddock and favourable conditions also helped contain the blaze. Reports a home near Maroona had been destroyed by the same fire could not be confirmed on Friday night, but residents of the town had been told to leave as the fire was heading towards them. Victoria had an extreme fire danger rating, with temperatures predicted to hit 40C in the west with winds gusting up to 90km/h. In South Australia, two bushfires were burning out of control and threatening homes and lives. About 500 firefighters and eight aircraft were battling to contain blazes at Humbug Scrub in the Mount Lofty Ranges and Tantanoola in the south-east of the state.    The scrub fire at Tantanoola was travelling towards the towns of Glencoe and Burrungule. Authorities had warned it was no longer safe to leave the area by vehicle or by foot. Country Fire Service spokesman Rob Sanford said the forecast conditions were the worst the state had experienced this summer. “We need the entire community to be prepared for the rest of today, through tonight and through tomorrow,” he said Friday. “If fires start under those conditions, they will be uncontrollable. People’s lives will be put at risk and communities will be put at risk.” Tasmania had imposed a state-wide fire ban. “Machinery that emit sparks, such as mowers, slashers, grinders and other cutting tools are banned as this type of activity has the potential to start fires,” Tasmania fire service chief Gavin Freeman said. There was also a ban on harvesting between 11am and 6pm, and authorities had asked that non-essential water use be curbed so water was available for fire crews if needed.

Vizzini manages to capture the heart and the pain that is throughout a psychiatric hospital in a beautifully moving and funny way. He manages to make you smile straight after a moment when you nearly cry with sadness. He balances this so well and his personal experience shines through as he show through this book the turmoil of being in their position. Craig is the main character of the story and it is narrated by him. This is perfect for this book as you see Craig's innermost thoughts and it helps you understand psychiatric problems better as it comes from someone you can relate to, since he is a teenager. It also brings a human quality to the book as you can understand the struggles he is going through that have lead him to where he is at in the story, such as school and peer pressures. If you ever get a chance, read this book and it will make you understand things in a way you didn't before. • Buy this book at the Guardian Bookshop. Want to tell the world about a book you've read?

And Happy Playoffs! A “whole new season”, as you might have heard some players and pundits claim in the last few weeks. That might not strictly be true for the pros, but it certainly is right here on the NFL Talkboard, where our Pick Six contest is succeeded by Pick The Playoffs. After the Super Bowl, we will combine scores from both to establish our overall champion.  For now I can tell you that the Pick Six finished in a three-way tie. aojigbo led the way going into week 17, but a score of just three out of six allowed DevonGiant and Dsizzle2013 to pull level. Each called 71 games correctly out of a possible 102 over the course of the season – giving them a remarkable average of 4.17 per week. Do join me in a virtual standing ovation for all three.   And let’s have some appreciation, too, for antjclark, the only person to call all six games correctly in week 17. After that, you can get to picking this week’s games:   Arizona Cardinals @ Carolina Panthers (Saturday 4.35pm ET/9.35pm GMT)  The Panthers will not be the first team with a losing record to host an NFL playoff game. But they will be the first to do so as favourites. At time of writing, the Las Vegas bookies have Arizona as 6.5-point underdogs despite winning four more games than Carolina during the regular season.   It is easy to see why. Arizona have lost four of their last six games, and are expected to have their third-string quarterback, Ryan Lindley, under center. Carolina, by contrast, have won four straight, in great part because of improved play from their secondary. The counterpoint is that three of their last four opponents were division rivals from the inept NFC South, while the other was a Cleveland team that started Johnny Manziel.   On the other side of the ball, Arizona’s defense should make life very hard for Cam Newton and company. But if the Carolina quarterback can escape the pocket and make plays with his legs – as both Russell Wilson and Colin Kaepernick have against Arizona in the last two weeks – then his team will have a very good chance indeed. Panthers to win    Baltimore Ravens @ Pittsburgh Steelers (Saturday 8.15pm ET/Sunday 1.15am GMT)    Will Kamar Aiken’s Ravens be celebrating this weekend? Photograph: Gail Burton/AP    The build-up to Saturday’s all-AFC North clash has been dominated by discussion of one man. Steelers running back Le’Veon Bell hyper-extended his knee against Cincinnati last weekend, and remains an injury doubt for Saturday – although his recovery has thus far been progressing more smoothly than he or his team had anticipated.   To lose a player who racked up 2,215 all-purpose yards during the regular season would clearly be a blow but, in this particular matchup, it is one that Pittsburgh can survive. Bell was never likely to be the Steelers’ most important player against a defense that ranks fourth in the league against the run. When these teams met at Heinz Field November, he managed just 20 yards on 10 rushing attempts. Pittsburgh still won, 43-23.   It would be asking a lot of Ben Roethlisberger to expect him to throw six touchdowns this weekend, as he did back then. But the Ravens have rarely played well on the road this season, and do not have an offensive weapon to compare with Pittsburgh’s Antonio Brown. Steelers to win  Cincinnati Bengals @ Indianapolis Colts (Sunday 1pm ET/6pm GMT)  Here we are again. For the fourth time in as many seasons, Andy Dalton has led the Bengals to the playoffs. In each of the past three, his team has lost in the Wild Card round.   He stands to earn a million-dollar bonus if he can go a step further this year, but doing so will not be easy. Cincinnati were beaten 27-0 by Indianapolis in week seven. Dalton was horrific that day, completing just 18 of 38 passes for an average of 3.3 yards per attempt. But he was not the only one who struggled. The Bengals managed a combined 32 yards on the ground.   They have changed starting running back since then, promoting Jeremy Hill over Giovani Bernard and reaping the rewards. The rookie’s 441 rushing yards in the December were most of any player in the league. If he can maintain such form against a middle-of-the-road Colts defense then Cincinnati will be in with a chance. But if this game turns into a shoot-out, it is hard to imagine Dalton keeping up with Andrew Luck. Colts to win  Detroit Lions @ Dallas Cowboys (Sunday 4.40pm ET/9.40pm GMT)    Calvin Johnson will be up against Dallas’s pass defense, which has struggled at times. Photograph: Chris Graythen/Getty Images    The Lions played five games during the regular season against teams who went on to finish with winning records. They prevailed in just one of them, beating Green Bay 19-7 at home – all the way back in week three. Detroit have made some positive strides in 2014, but an erratic passing game (surprising given the talent at both quarterback and receiver) has made it hard for them to keep up with better teams.   On paper, their chances of a victory in Dallas look slim. The Cowboys go into the playoffs on the back of a four-game winning streak in which they have averaged 41.5 points per game. They have the NFL’s leading rusher in the backfield and a quarterback, Tony Romo, who is playing at close to MVP level.   And yet, Detroit might be better-equipped than they initially appear. The league’s best rushing defense will have its single most disruptive player present after Ndamukong Suh’s suspension for stepping on Aaron Rodgers was overturned. The Lions will also have Dominic Raiola back at center after his one-game ban. With him anchoring the line, is it really so unthinkable that Matthew Stafford and Calvin Johnson could rediscover a little lost magic against the league’s 26th-ranked pass defense.   I think this game could get a lot closer than some have imagined. But in the end, I do expect the better team to prevail. Cowboys to win",profile/nicky-bandini,Nicky,Bandini 
181,2015-01-02T09:00:07Z,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2015/jan/02/ankles-the-only-way-to-flesh-the-flash-this-winter,Ankles – the only way to flesh the flash this winter,fashion,Fashion,The Guardian,"Weather-permitting, the case for flesh flashing has found new legs this year. If we learned anything from 2014, it’s that ankles were the new sideboob.    Irina Koslovan in Saint Laurent shoes last September Photograph: Vanni Bassetti/Getty Images   Ankle grazers or ankle teasers – trousers which are cut or rolled to a few inches above the foot, were arguably autumn’s most subtle trend. And, with next spring’s collections coming into store now, the ankle grazer is fast becoming the way to navigate that tricky period between winter and early spring when it’s too cold for bare legs but you’re still desperate to flash a little flesh. To coin a new portmanteau, we are officially in flankle (flashed ankle) season. Fashion’s relationship with exposed bodyparts is no new thing. In the past few years, the skill of looking naked while still wearing clothes has become a red carpet impasse. From sideboob (everyone) to navel grazin tops (Miley Cyrus); sidebutt (see Gwyneth Paltrow) to knee-flashing (think: Kanye West on the FROW) no season in fashion is complete without a little bare skin. Exposed ankles, however, are a new source of fascination when it’s too chilly to go bare legged but you’re too skint to get a cab.     ASOS Premium wide Leg Trousers asos Photograph: asos   As new trends go, this one is relatively entrenched on the high street – slightly cropped or rolled jeans, geometric print trousers and dungarees were two-a-penny at Levi’s, Topshop and Whistles this past season. Asos, as well, have seen a sharp spike in ankle grazers to the point that they even have their own subsection. In the last 12 months, they’ve introduced 14 new styles, with five more to come over the next month, altogether an increase of 300% on last year. The ever prophetic Topshop Unique showed some subtle, nautical striped extra-long capri pants at their SS15 show, Chanel plumped for turned up tweeds while Nicole Farhi went the whole hog and made the ankle even more of a statement with front slits exposing a v-shape of ankle. Whereas most trends can be traced directly to the catwalk, this one arguably (and unusually) stems from its more practical sister: street style. Bare legs are a sign that you have an interest and understanding of fashion. The Autumn/Winter shows which take place in Paris, Milan, London and New York February are usually flush with bare legs and huge coats as editors and bloggers rush from show to show, trying to look chic while being able to withstand the chilly Parisian winds between shows.     Ankle flashing in the Whistles AW14 campaign Photograph: Whistles/whistles   Contemporary Buyer at Selfridges Ciara Flood thinks the ankle trend has become “prevalent” but that it’s less about fashion and more about status: “a tanned winter leg, be it shin or ankle, evokes a global life, one week on the beach, next week in the big city.”  Since autumn, the Selfridges buying team have seen it translated in two ways: “a cropped wider pant worn with a classic black high pumps (think Comme Comme’s cashmere trousers, which are warm but cropped and Jimmy Choo’s Abel in suede) - or for the a more relaxed look, socks and ‘furkenstocks’”. The good news is that ankle flashing is relatively accessible, regardless of whether you have a second home or a Jimmy Choo budget. The key to exposing an ankle in winter, Flood explains, is simply about balance. The wearer should be top heavy: “a cropped pant should be worn with a chunky knit … and a large scarf”. Owing to its versatility, there is an argument for exposing your ankles under a winter dress. Flood recommends “a large turtle neck knitwear dress skimming the shin to reveal a small section of skin, built up from the bottom with a chunky ankle boot....a peeping ankle sock in a grey or black is also totally acceptable” or Acne’s AW14 cream Gala dress which hits the ‘awkward’ length sold out in two weeks.  If it still feels too cold, the good news is that this trend is expected to segue neatly into late spring/summer, via Bermuda shorts. Philip Lim, Acne, and Helmut Lang are all bringing out awkwardly length shorts, too. To many of us, going completely bare-legged remains relatively impractical (not to mention high maintenance) in this season. But a sliver of ankle, with a statement shoe or luxe sock might be the only way to marry chicness without contracting hypothermia.",profile/morwennaferrier,Morwenna,Ferrier
182,2015-01-02T09:00:07Z,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/jan/02/altered-images-photography-as-a-tool-for-gender-equality,Altered images: photography as a tool for gender equality,global-development-professionals-network,Global Development Professionals Network,The Guardian,"Three years ago I was travelling in Istanbul, snapping away with my Canon 600D, when four girls came up and asked if they could take a look at my camera. I started teaching them how to take pictures. Even though they did not speak much English, we connected over photography. I realised then that taking pictures is a universal language that transcends cultural boundaries. I started thinking about whether photography could transcend other types of boundaries that hold girls back from achieving their potential. That led to me and an old classmate setting up Lensational, a social enterprise aiming to empower women and girls in the developing world by equipping them with cameras and photography training.  We started teaching photography to Filipino and Indonesian domestic helpers in Hong Kong. Jem, one of our Filipino domestic helpers, told us that learning to take photos helped her to overcome the loneliness of being far away from her family.  When thinking about where to go next, I looked at the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report. Pakistan caught my eye. It bred heroines like Benazir Bhutto, the first woman elected to head a Muslim country, and Malala Yousafzai, who risked her life in the fight for access to education for girls. I was curious to find out if they have inspired their fellow Pakistani women and girls to fight for their own rights.  In the summer of 2013 I started an internship at Pakistan’s Citizens’ Commission for Human Development (CCHD) in Lahore, which was organised by Aiesec, a global NGO that provides young people with cross-cultural internships. On the first day I pitched Lensational to my boss, Farrah Azeem Khan, an inspirational leader who worked closely with Benazir Bhutto. She liked the idea, especially how it could help women and girls discover their inner selves. She helped me arrange workshops and assigned two interns to my photography workshops to help with translation. I had brought 12 disposable cameras with me from Hong Kong, donated by an NGO called The PhotoCrafters. Over the next month I ran photography workshops for 60 Pakistanis, mainly women and girls. I tried to engage men and boys in my photography workshops too, as they have a crucial role to play in gender equality. In Hong Kong, we only conducted workshops for women as our aim is to empower women through photography. However in Pakistan, I was given the advice that in order for my programmes to be socially accepted, I needed to engage men and boys as well.  I adapted my workshop content to the needs of men and boys, with more technical details around ISO, lighting and flash. I had to overcome my own self-consciousness of speaking in front of 30 18-year-old male students and realised that the art form is a neutral entry point to engage men and boys. The desire to capture memories, thoughts and emotions through photography is universal, regardless of income and gender.  Our photography workshops focus not only on the technicalities of operating cameras, but also on how the participants can express their thoughts and feelings through the press of the shutter. I encouraged them to share their aspirations for the future with each other. We ran workshops with students and teachers at non-formal schools, children in the slums and the children of sex workers in Lahore’s red light district.  Following a successful crowdfunding campaign, we will return to Pakistan in April 2015 to equip the previous participants with their own cameras. The workshops provide them with the medium to express themselves despite illiteracy. With their own cameras they also have the possibility of earning extra income through selling photographs. Part of the Lensastional model is to sell pictures taken through the workshops. In 2015, I hope that Lensational will help workshop participants earn extra income either through selling pictures in the developed world, or finding freelance photography opportunities locally.  Photography is a powerful agent of social change. During one of our workshops in Pakistan, we were taking pictures near a motorbike. Some boys rushed to pose on it, but not one girl moved forward. One of the girls eventually raised her hand with courage. She jumped on the motorbike, probably the first time in her life. This is a country where women and girls are not seen driving motorbikes. Her eyes were sparkling. I named this photograph ‘Courage to Drive’. The press of shutter created an image to challenge the definition of women and girls in this society. Men and boys may show skepticism in the beginning, as the faces in this photograph suggest, but as they see new images of girls and women they may change their minds. We hope that other girls we engage through Lensational can be as brave as this girl. Bonnie Chiu is the co-founder of Lensational. Follow @LensationalOrg on Twitter.

183,2015-01-02T09:01:07Z,https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/jan/02/childrens-book-reviews-roundup-top-reads-2014,What were your top reads of 2014? Reader reviews roundup special!,childrens-books-site,Children's books,The Guardian,"There were over 1,000 reviews on the Children’s books site in 2014, but which books get the most praise from the world’s toughest critics (that would be you!)? Here at Guardian children’s books we’ve been busy searching our archives, emptying our cupboards and wearing down our pencil tips compiling a list of the most-reviewed books across the site during the last year. Can you guess what’s top? 1. The Fault in our Stars by John Green Topping our list with a whopping 15 reviews – surprise, surprise – is John Green’s bestseller about teen love and the meaning of life. You must know the story by now but for those who’ve been living in a cave for the past three years, the two main characters – Hazel and Augustus – meet at a Cancer Support Group and embark on a life-changing journey. Along the way they find love, friendship and a new understanding of what it means to be alive. Site member ThePinkElephant wonderfully summarised the storyline in her review: “They ask questions that relate to all of us: Will I be loved? Will I be remembered? Will I leave a mark?”  2. Two Boys Kissing by David Levithan Described as “endearing”, “intricate” and “poetic”, this astonishing read – which got 10 thumbs up from our site members – centres around a kiss. “But, it goes much deeper than just that,” says CaraErica. This kiss – which aims to break the world record for the longest ever – is carried out by two boys, Craig and Harry. The attempt has a profound effect on seven teenagers, who are all in various stages of coming to terms with their sexuality. As Orangutan36 aptly explains, “watched by the world, these boys are a pivot point for the stories of other characters”. Our site members couldn’t praise it highly enough: Joel commented that “The novel has a completely unique style of writing that I have never seen attempted before!” while Noggin expressed similar sentiments, noting that “Two Boys Kissing is a really eye opening story … it makes you change your perception of homosexuality.” 3. The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins Tied with Two Boys Kissing on 10 reviews was – another turn up for the books, eh! – the first instalment of the bestselling trilogy The Hunger Games. Again for the hermits amongst you, in this dystopian future the world is split up into 12 factions, with the Capitol running an annual fight to the death. There’s a reason the series is so popular; as Acornsized explains, “This is one of the most interesting series I’ve read with a very realistic plot that’s easy to imagine.” Nellie999 also praised Collins’ writing style: “This book is full of emotions and tension … the description used in the book really made you relate to the characters.” Summing up the effect of the series, group reviewers El Camino Academy 6th Grade concluded, “The Hunger Games is marvelous, dangerous, and filled with mixed emotions.” So just imagine how many reviews Suzanne Collins got if you add in Catching Fire and Mockingjay! 4. Divergent by Veronica Roth Continuing the dystopian theme, our next most popular readers’ pick is Divergent by Veronica Roth, which comes in at 9 reviews – and which our site members described as “fantastic”, “fast-paced” and “explosive”. As the first book in Veronica Roth’s bestselling trilogy, this novel is set in a post-apocalyptic world where society is divided into five factions based on a single core value. Teenager Beatrice (Tris) does not fit into a fraction, and is labelled as Divergent. PearlyDewdrops terrifically summarised the storyline in their review: “Tris learns what it means to be Divergent and what a critical position it puts her in and all the while she is unearthing the hidden evil of the other factions as a war brews right under her nose.” Our readers also felt a strong connection with protagonist Tris, and this might be why reviewers kept returning to the book: “I felt that I was living alongside Beatrice through all her trials and triumphs as she was such a convincing heroine,” praised Readaholic. PearlyDewdrops also liked the first-person narrative of Tris, which she felt “allowed us as readers to establish a deeper connection with the character and understand her with more ease”. Again, including Allegiant and Insurgent, Roth’s reviews are approaching world-domination proportion! 5. Rooftoppers by Katherine Rundell And last but most certainly not least our final top read of 2014 is last year’s Guardian children’s fiction prize winner Rooftoppers by Katherine Rundell. In this story (which garnered an impressive 8 reviews, tied with RJ Palacio’s Wonder, September’s Teen book club read), Sophie is found as a baby floating in a cello case after the sinking of the Queen Mary. Rescued and brought up by an eccentric academic, when the authories threaten to put Sophie in a home for orphans she decides to escape to the Paris rooftops and look for her mother. “She writes in such a way that makes you want to know what happens and leaves you with a bond with the characters she creates,” says Potterhead103 in their terrific review. Similarly, PetrovaFossil explained their love of the characters: “My favourite part of the book was how I warmed to Sophie. She is such a likeable person.” Safah aptly summed up the novel: “Jumping from rooftops, breaking into confidential records, making friends, and most importantly, learning to never ignore an impossible, this story had a fairytale feel that taught one to always have faith.” Need some more ideas for good reads to cuddle up with this winter? Other popular books this year included: • Wonder by R J Palacio • More Than This by Patrick Ness • The Geography of You and Me by Jennifer E Smith • We Were Liars by Emily Lockhart • Trouble by Non Pratt What’s your favourite book?

184,2015-01-02T09:01:56Z,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/02/facebook-defamation-man-wins-lawsuit-over-estranged-wifes-domestic-violence-post,Facebook defamation: man wins lawsuit over estranged wife's domestic violence post,technology,Technology,The Guardian,"A West Australian man has successfully sued his estranged wife for defamation over a Facebook post that suggested she was the victim of domestic violence, after a Perth court found she could not prove the statement was true. Bunbury teacher Miro Dabrowski was awarded $12,500 in damages at the West Australian district court in December by Justice Michael Bowden. The offending post, which was posted on his estranged wife Robyn Greeuw’s public Facebook profile in December 2012, read: “Separated from Miro Dabrowski after 18 years of suffering domestic violence and abuse. Now fighting the system to keep my children safe.” Greeuw removed the post from her page in February 2013, after she received a letter from Dabrowski’s lawyer. But in his decision, Bowden writes that Greewu told the court she had written part of that statement into Facebook but not published it, and suggested her computer had been hacked to create the screenshot of the post that was used in the trial. She also argued that the statement was not defamatory or, if it was, that it was covered under the justification defence which allows the publication of defamatory material if it can be proved to be “substantially true”. Greewu, who represented herself, described a long history of emotional and occasionally physical abuse to the court, which she said began soon after the pair married in 1992. The relationship ended on 2 March 2012, when police served Dabrowski with an interim violence restraining order from Greewu at their house. Dabrowski denied he was ever abusive.  In his decision, Bowden said some of Dabrowski’s comments about the nature of the relationship were “incredulous”. But he said Greewu’s “implausible” claims about how the Facebook post came to be undermined her credibility, and meant he could not find she had been the victim of domestic violence and abuse on her word alone. “Domestic violence and abuse by its very nature usually occur in the matrimonial home and in the absence of independent witnesses. I accept that defamation findings can be made solely on the evidence of one partner against the other,” Bowden said. “However, Ms Greeuw’s credibility is so badly affected by the matters to which I have referred that it leads to the conclusion that she is prepared to say or write whatever she thinks will suit her case and I would not be prepared to accept her evidence unless it is supported by independent evidence or documents contemporaneously made with the events she now complains of.” Three witnesses, including Dabrowski’s girlfriend, who split up with him for 10 months after reading the post, and his brother, who took the screenshots used in the case, told the court the post caused them to doubt his character.  Dabrowski told the court he was concerned the post would affect his teaching career.  In finding the case in his favour, Bowden said Dabrowski was “an experienced educator and is entitled to public vindication”. In March 2014, a former Orange high School Student was ordered to pay $105,000 in damages to music teacher Christine Mickle after the New South Wales district court found he had defamed her on Twitter and Facebook.

185,2015-01-02T09:30:07Z,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/02/season-dieting-thin-bigger-person,"’Tis the season of dieting, but living life to the max is not just for thin people",commentisfree,Opinion,The Guardian,"It’s now new year, but just how happy it’ll be for people with body image issues is in doubt. The national body confidence campaigning group Be Real recently carried out a media audit, revealing the increase in diet messaging that every January brings with it. It warned against the “damaging impact of quick-fix fad diets on body image”, underlining the fact that people felt “an unbearable pressure to conform to an idealistic body shape at all stages of their lives”. Also included in the statement was a standout statistic claiming a fifth of Britons would be willing to sacrifice one of their fingers to have the perfect body. I’m betting that this would not have come as a surprise to the millions of us who, along with our friends and family, have battled the demons that come with having a body that can feel out of control. We would all like a quick fix, right? A little button to press that makes our boobs face the same direction, a lever that instantly makes our legs look like hot dogs rather than tree trunks. And who can blame us? I’ve lost five stone (32kg) so many times I get weirded out at night wondering where all those stones went, until I remember I’ve just gone and put them back on again. The shame and exhaustion involved in yo-yo dieting, the humiliation of not being able to find exercise clothes that fit you and then feeling that everyone is judging you at the gym – it’s enough to make the most hardened dieters give up, stay home and hide in the margins of life. But that would be a huge waste of potential. A few months ago I wrote about bigger women doing yoga and the response was overwhelming. I received so many messages from women who had felt too scared to even ask about classes at yoga schools for fear of not fitting in – literally. Strangers tweeted me, friends’ mums got in touch on Facebook. One of the schools I mentioned in my piece had to field hundreds of inquiries about places the day it was published. That’s one article, and it was about yoga, which isn’t everyone’s bag, so my guess is there are loads of bigger people out there who are secretly desperate to try windsurfing, ice-skating, zip-wiring, trampolining, scuba diving, velodrome cycling, glow-in-the-dark spin or street dancing – but who don’t because of their size, who are understandably fearful of trying these things. But the fact is we mustn’t be. Not because we have an obligation to be thin, to be attractive in a certain way, or because a former Apprentice candidate says we should, but because we all have a duty to enjoy our life and to really live it. We shouldn’t put off doing the things we want to do until we are thin. We shouldn’t wait, we should do them now. Health At Every Size (HAES) is a hashtag, a community and an organisation but it’s more than that: it is a movement. People no longer believe that the war on obesity works, but rather that it is a painful war on the obese. Rather than being bullied into doing things you don’t enjoy because it worked for someone else, you could adopt the HAES ethos, which is that we should all feel the confidence to be ourselves, as we are now, doing the things that make life exciting. The irony is we will all be fitter and healthier if we do, no matter what our size. It’s all very well my saying this when it can be hard to find a scuba suit in a size 22. Plus, what’s the point in you being all crazily positive, enthusiastically bounding into a contemporary dance class, if the teacher is an ignorant, unhelpful body fascist? The fact is that unless bigger people start inhabiting these places, nothing will change. The only answer is to be prepared for that possibility (it’s definitely not inevitable, as I found with yoga) and be unrepentant – challenge them to work with you. As for clothes, use all TEN of your fingers, if you’re lucky enough to have them, to write and schedule an onslaught of emails to sportswear manufacturers, asking for a range of beautiful gear in bigger sizes, now. After all, we’re the ones meant to be getting fitter.",profile/deborah-coughlin,Deborah,Coughlin
186,2015-01-02T09:30:55Z,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/02/sony-hackers-may-still-access-computer-systems-the-interview,Sony hackers may still have access to computer systems,technology,Technology,The Guardian,"Sony Entertainment is unable to confirm that hackers have been eradicated from its computer systems more than a month after the film studio was hit by a debilitating cyber-attack, a report says. The chief executive, Michael Lynton, has described how the company came up with an old-style communications system based on a “phone tree” to relay updates on the hack from person to person. An old cache of BlackBerrys was also brought into action because the phones receive email via their own servers. “It took me 24 or 36 hours to fully understand that this was not something we were going to be able to recover from in the next week or two,” Lynton told the Wall Street Journal. Citing two people familiar with the investigation, the WSJ said investigators were unable to confirm that the hackers had been eradicated from Sony’s systems. If the systems remain secure, Sony’s network is expected to be fully operational within the next two months but hackers have so far released only a tiny fraction of the 100 terabytes of data they claim to have stolen.    Sony Entertainment boss Michael Lynton said his priority was to make the key decisions quickly in the wake of the cyber-attack. Photograph: David Sillitoe/Guardian   A group calling itself Guardians of Peace claimed responsibility for the hack in November, which resulted in the leak of current blockbusters, embarrassing private emails and the personal information of more than 47,000 people, including staff and a handful of film stars. North Korea is suspected of being involved in the hack, which preceded the release of the Sony Pictures film The Interview, a James Franco and Seth Rogen comedy that depicts an attempt to assassinate leader Kim Jong-un. The North Korean ambassador Ja Song-nam described the film’s release as an “act of war” in a letter to the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, in July, while the North Korean foreign ministry threatened “merciless countermeasures” if the US allowed it to be released. But Pyongyang has denied involvement in the cyber-attack. Lynton said Sony’s IT department had scrambled to get basic systems such as email back online over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend while the FBI and investigators from the cybersecurity firm FireEye searched for clues as to who had accessed the systems. Lynton said his priority was to make the key decisions quickly in the wake of the attack. “You can’t be caught in the headlights doing nothing,” he said. He said he was continuing to try to ease tense relations with large cinema chains, such as AMC and Regal Entertainment, which had refused to screen The Interview after the hackers made threats of violence. Lynton said he had personally called heads of the major chains to try to patch things up after he blamed them, in an interview on the US TV station CNN, for the cancellation of the general release of the movie. Since then the film has taken more than $18m (£11.6m) in digital and box-office revenues, making it Sony Pictures’ biggest ever online film release, helped by the publicity around the hack and offsetting its $44m budget.",profile/sarahbutler,Sarah,Butler
187,2015-01-02T09:46:10Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/01/steven-gerrard-leave-liverpool-end-season,Steven Gerrard to leave Liverpool at end of the season,football,Football,The Guardian,"Steven Gerrard has decided not to sign a contract extension with Liverpool and is set to announce he will be leaving his boyhood club at the end of this season. Liverpool’s captain of the past 11 years is expected to confirm on Friday that his glittering 17-year career at Anfield will finish when his current contract expires this summer. Gerrard was offered a new deal by the club in November but, having weighed up the prospect of reduced playing time for Brendan Rodgers’ team next season against the lure of a move abroad, has opted for a fresh experience in the twilight of his career. Gerrard has not agreed a pre-contract deal with another club and remains open-minded about his next destination but is believed to be considering several offers from MLS. LA Galaxy and New York Red Bulls are understood to be keen on the 34-year-old, as are several clubs in the Middle East, and the former England captain is leaning towards taking his young family to the United States. He is set to release a statement confirming his intentions to avoid becoming a distraction for Rodgers and Liverpool for the remainder of the season. Rodgers has previously stated that Gerrard’s reluctance to sign a new deal at Anfield was not down to money but “a life decision”. The midfielder has had to adjust to being rested for the first time in his career this season – notably at Real Madrid in the Champions League and more recently against Swansea City in the Premier League on Monday – while his performances have come under severe scrutiny during Liverpool’s difficult campaign. His importance continues to be demonstrated, however, with Gerrard almost inspiring another Champions League rescue act against Basel last month and scoring two penalties in Liverpool’s disappointing 2-2 draw at home to Leicester City on New Year’s Day. Gerrard has come close to leaving his hometown team twice before, for Chelsea in 2004 and 2005, and has previously rejected offers from the likes of Bayern Munich to remain at Anfield. But he appears set on moving on this summer and became free to sign a pre-contract agreement with a foreign club from 1 January. Gerrard will not consider joining another English club out of respect for Liverpool. While the captain’s decision may not register as a huge surprise given his position and Liverpool’s season, it equates to a major setback for Rodgers who had championed a new contract for Gerrard and was keen for the midfielder to remain part of his first-team plans. The manager has also raised the prospect of a coaching role for Gerrard but that plan must now be postponed for the foreseeable future. Gerrard has developed into Liverpool’s figurehead for the best part of his eventful career, scoring 180 goals in 695 appearances for the club and winning 11 trophies. He is the only player to score in a Champions League final, a Uefa Cup final, an FA Cup final and a League Cup final. He will be synonymous for, among other achievements, inspiring Liverpool’s remarkable fightback from three goals down to beat Milan in the 2005 Champions League final. The midfielder’s decision raises questions over why Liverpool delayed until November to offer him a new contract and will mean the club has lost its two most recognisable talents, Luis Suárez and Gerrard, in successive summers. Gerrard is determined to end on a high a Liverpool career that has brought every major honour with the glaring exception of the Premier League title, with more silverware – Rodgers’ team face Chelsea in the Capital One Cup semi-finals later this month – and a top-four finish his priorities before he departs. Gerrard, Liverpool’s record goalscorer in European football, does not want his Anfield career to peter out and despite admitting to being a home bird on several occasions, is keen to experience a different culture away from the goldfish bowl of Merseyside. MLS appears most likely to benefit from Liverpool’s loss.",profile/andyhunter,Andy,Hunter

",football,Football,The Guardian,"Steven Gerrard has formally announced that he is to leave Liverpool at the end of the season. The midfield captain, who will turn 35 in May, is out of contract in the summer and despite being offered a new deal, he has decided the time is right to leave and pursue a fresh challenge. Gerrard, who scored two penalties in Liverpool’s 2-2 draw against Leicester on New Year’s Day, is immediately free to talk to foreign clubs. Liverpool announced the news in a tweet on Friday, saying: “LFC can confirm that Steven Gerrard is to leave the club at the end of the 2014-15 season.” In a statement on their website the club added: “Gerrard will not retire from professional football at the conclusion of the 2014-15 season. No decision on his new club has been made yet, but he will continue his career outside the United Kingdom and at a side that will not bring him into direct competition with Liverpool.”    Explaining his decision, Gerrard thanked his manager Brendan Rodgers and said: “This has been the toughest decision of my life and one which both me and my family have agonised over for a good deal of time. “I am making the announcement now so that the manager and the team are not distracted by stories or speculation about my future.    Steven Gerrard arrives at Melwood on Friday. Photograph: Andrew Yates/Reuters   “Liverpool Football Club has been such a huge part of all our lives for so long and saying goodbye is going to be difficult, but I feel it’s something that’s in the best interests of all involved, including my family and the club itself. “I’m going to carry on playing and although I can’t confirm at this stage where that will be, I can say it will be somewhere that means I won’t be playing for a competing club and will not therefore be lining up against Liverpool – that is something I could never contemplate. “My decision is completely based on my wish to experience something different in my career and life and I also want to make sure that I have no regrets when my playing career is eventually over.” He added: “It is a very special place to be part of. It is my sincere hope and wish that one day I can return to serve Liverpool again, in whatever capacity best helps the club.” His manager said: “It is almost an impossible task to find the words to appropriately sum up Steven Gerrard and his importance to Liverpool.    “This is an era where the word ‘legend’ is vastly overused, but in his case it actually doesn’t do him justice.” Gerrard has not yet decided on a future destination, but a move to Major League Soccer has long been rumoured and Los Angeles Galaxy are said to be interested, as are clubs in the Middle East. His close friend Jamie Carragher wrote on Twitter on Thursday night: “Sad day for LFC & English football with the Gerrard news, I think it’s the right decision all things considered.” Gerrard joined Liverpool as an eight-year-old and has made 695 appearances and scored 180 goals, winning 11 trophies with the pinnacle being lifting the Champions League in 2005. He made his first-team debut in 1998 and was made captain in 2003.    Liverpool’s owners described his contribution to the club as “beyond measure”. The principal owner John W Henry and chairman Tom Werner jointly said: “His contribution to the club is almost beyond measure and it’s testimony to his influence, that despite Liverpool having such a long and distinguished list of legendary figures, the name Steven Gerrard will always be at the summit. “Steven will always have a part to play for this club, as and when the time comes that he wishes to return.”   Related: Steven Gerrard makes right call in ending a remarkable Liverpool career | Daniel Taylor   Steven Gerrard’s roll of honour Liverpool: FA Cup (2): 2001, 2006 League Cup (3): 2001, 2003, 2012 Community Shield (1): 2006 Champions League (1): 2005 Uefa Cup (1): 2001 Uefa Super Cup (1): 2001 Individual: Professional Footballers’ Association player of the year (1): 2006 Professional Footballers’ Association young player of the year (1): 2001 PFA team of the year (8): 2001, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2014 Football Writers’ Association footballer of the year (1): 2009 Uefa club footballer of the year (1): 2005 MBE: 2007",profile/jamiejackson,jackson,jamie

Around 1.26 billion filmgoers bought tickets to see a movie in 2014, the lowest number since 1995, when the figure was 1.21 billion. The disappointing return offers further evidence that the US, which makes up by far the largest portion of the North American box office, is likely to lose its position as the world’s largest film market to China before the end of the decade. The average cost of a movie ticket was slightly up, from $8.13 in 2013 to $8.15 this year. But it is still estimated that overall revenue fell by 5% since 2013, to around $10.36bn – the biggest annual drop in nine years. In China, latest studies suggest 830 million people bought tickets in 2014. That figure is up 34.5% on last year, and suggests that the country could overtake North America on tickets sold by 2017. Overall revenue stands at $4.77bn – still less than half of the North American total, but up by 36% on 2013.     The trailer for The Amazing Spider-Man 2, which underperformed at the US box office  The North American box office suffered in large part because of the failure of a number of blockbuster sequels to match the financial returns of their predecessors. The Amazing Spider-Man 2, released in May, took just $202m in the US and Canada, compared to $403m for Spider-Man in 2002, the year that the North American box office hit an all-time high with 1.57 billion people buying tickets. June’s Transformers: Age of Extinction and November’s The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1, also produced weaker results than predecessors. And Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, while performing superbly for a previously unheralded comic book property, with $332m in North America, could not hit the heights of the same studio’s The Avengers ($623m in 2012) or Iron Man 3 ($409m in 2013).     Sharp shooter ... Chris Pratt in Guardians of the Galaxy Photograph: AP   It’s not all bad news, however. Next year sees the release of blockbuster shoo-ins such as The Avengers: Age of Ultron, the final instalment in The Hunger Games saga, and, at the tail end of the year, the new Star Wars effort The Force Awakens. Other films which might plunder the box office include the new Jurassic Park movie, Jurassic World, Pixar entries Inside Out and The Good Dinosaur, Disney’s live action fairytale Cinderella and the much hyped sex drama Fifty Shades of Grey.  This article was amended on 2 January 2015. The original headline indicated that box office takings were at their lowest in 20 years. In fact it’s attendance figures that have hit that low. This has been corrected.  ",profile/benchild,child,ben
190,2015-01-02T10:00:08Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jan/02/new-york-city-fc-may-be-better-off-without-frank-lampard,New York City FC may be better off without Frank Lampard,football,Football,The Guardian,"“We want to be New Yorkers. We are building a truly authentic New York team. This is not a Manchester City team or a brand play or a marketing trick - this is real”. Ferran Soriano, CEO of New York City, has repeated that line so often that you could be forgiven for thinking he felt his dual role as CEO of Manchester City raised suspicions. Yet after choosing to name their MLS club City and dress them in the English club’s colours, the club do indeed look rather like a a pale blue imitation of the real thing. And now Frank Lampard, instead of being the face of NYFC’s first season, will remain at the Etihad Stadium until the end of the Premier League campaign – because that is what Manchester City wanted.  With City manager Manuel Pellegrini not even able to confirm that the former Chelsea midfielder will move to New York at the end of the season, there is the prospect of the Lampard saga running into the summer. But paradoxically the mess offers NYCFC a chance to do something that might not only resolve the situation but could also be a start for them at least looking like a strong football club with their own identity.  NYCFC could (if there are no other secret contractual details yet to be revealed) publicly move on from Lampard and quickly replace him, in the January transfer window, with another ‘Designated Player’ with no links to City. Those who recall the angst caused by David Beckham’s extended loans from LA Galaxy to Milan, will know that leaving Lampard’s arrival date at NYCFC hanging in the air through the first half of the season, risks the club looking weak and needy and their fans and the soccer media agitated. If New York fans feel snubbed, the club could show some solidarity with them and leave Lampard to his career in England. There are no shortage of marketable players who would be willing to move to MLS and who would generate similar buzz to Lampard. Liverpool’s Steven Gerrard is the latest to be linked with a move across the pond and would fit the bill perfectly. Barcelona’s Xavi Hernandez recently confirmed he was close to moving to New York during the close season and could perhaps be persuaded to rethink. Sheikh Mansour certainly doesn’t lack the resources to persuade European players near the end of their careers to move to New York. But NYCFC could also go in another direction and reject the entire marketing-led strategy of recruiting aging European stars to front their franchise. There are very few players who have the power Beckham had to generate mainstream media excitement. The case of Bradley Wright-Phillips, top scorer in MLS last season with the Red Bulls, is a reminder that getting younger, hungrier, foreign players can deliver positive results.   City have a vast scouting network, but so far they have recruited only from the domestic MLS market (mainly through the expansion draft) and then added two big names – Lampard and David Villa. A better use of City’s resources would be to bring in some of the talented players they have scouted globally who aren’t needed by the ‘mother club’ but who could excel in MLS – even if they don’t carry much marketing potential. The only major decision the club made that did not have a predictable Manchester City link was choosing as their head coach the highly-rated former Real Salt Lake boss Jason Kreis. It would be refreshing if the club were to use Mansour’s resources to give the 42-year-old American the chance to recruit players he feels would be able to bring success to his team.  Kreis knows what is needed to win in MLS – he led a stylish Real Salt Lake to the 2009 MLS title, defeating Beckham’s LA Galaxy in the final. He was astute in finding players from Central and South America who could fit within his club’s budget and his quick passing approach. With fewer financial restrictions, he could create something genuinely exciting in New York, a city whose fans might be sophisticated enough to be more impressed by successful, attractive football than the chance to see a ‘name’ at the end of his career.  Something has to be done. MLS has already lost one franchise, the doomed Los Angeles team Chivas USA. They were also branded after – and subservient to – a foreign club, Mexico’s C.D. Guadalajara. The league can ill-afford the NYFC franchise failing but with only 11,000 season tickets sold and their immediate home in the Yankee’s baseball park rather than the new soccer specific stadium they initially talked of, the Lampard saga is just the latest worrying sign. It is probably too late for NYCFC to row back from their ill-advised branding decisions – and give themselves an independent name and look – but they can start to get things right on the football front. By jettisoning Lampard, NYCFC would have two Designated Player slots available just as Europe is in the January transfer window. If City Football Group are interested in repairing the damage done by the Lampard affair they should use this next month to back Kreis and create a team that can do something New Yorkers always respect – win.",profile/simonevans,,Evans
191,2015-01-02T10:00:08Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jan/02/transfer-window-merry-go-round-jonathan-wilson,Transfer window is a merry go-round that no one can get off,football,Football,The Guardian,"“People should change their ideas,” Louis van Gaal warned after Manchester United had kept their sixth clean sheet of the season in drawing at Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. United have conceded only five goals in their last nine games and have the fourth best defensive record in the division. “It’s not about new players, it’s about organisation.” No subject has so nettled Van Gaal since his arrival at United as the suggestion that the club’s summer transfer policy left him short of defensive cover and, given how often United have been saved by the excellence of David De Gea this season, it’s hard to believe he really is as satisfied by his defence as he has made out, but the general point was a sound one. Perhaps it’s only natural in a league in which greed has at times seemed a virtue, in which depth of pocket is the most relevant factor in determining where a side will finish, in which transfer deadline day has come to seem a higher profile event than the League Cup final, but the Premier League has become a place in which the solution to almost any problem is to buy more players. The notion of coaching seems almost to have disappeared. After the recent 2-2 drawn between Liverpool and Arsenal, Gary Neville highlighted the sloppiness of the defending of both sides. There wasn’t the intensity or the organisation he would have expected in his days as a player, he said, and in truth this has been an issue for Arsenal in particular for several years. When they lost to Barcelona in the Champions League in successive seasons, the most striking contrast between the sides, both of them taking their tactical cues from the Ajax of the early Seventies, was not any great difference in technical ability but in how they pressed. Arsenal did so in ones and twos; Barcelona did so as a pack, one man going to the man with the ball, three or four others looking to shut down passing options. It was coherent and ruthless and, ultimately, it brought Barcelona victory; perhaps the quality of their players would have ensured a win anyway, but the difference in quality was enhanced by a vast difference in the coherence of their pressing. No one has any patience anymore; as Sir Alex Ferguson lamented in 2007, the boom in reality television and social media has led to a “mocking culture”. “You see it on all these TV shows where the panellists criticise the contestants,” he said then, in defence of Steve McClaren. “There’s a mocking industry now and it’s even generated by television programmes. Even when they skate, the panel then criticises them.” Managers and players are subject to the same dynamic: an idea that somehow if enough outrage is generated they can effectively be voted off a team. In the modern climate many of the greatest managerial reigns would probably have been stifled in their infancy. In Brian Clough’s first seasons at Derby County and at Nottingham Forest, he finished in the bottom half of the second flight. Within five years he had won the league with Derby; it took three with Forest. Alex Ferguson was in his seventh year at Manchester United when he won the league for the first time. Herbert Chapman was in his sixth at Arsenal. Don Revie just avoided relegation in his first season at Leeds; it took him three years to even be promoted. It’s little wonder given the perpetual threat of dismissal that managers now tend to prefer off-the-shelf talent rather than following the slow and imprecise root of developing players themselves. And that, of course, exacerbates the process: if there is a high turnover of players – and there are very few Premier League clubs who don’t sign at least half a dozen players each year – then it is harder for fans to develop an emotional bond with those players and that in turn makes the process of moving them on far easier (and also means fans are less likely to be supportive during a run of poor form). When United beat Liverpool 3-0 – their most eye-catching result of the season if not necessarily their best performance – not a single one of their summer signings started the game. Which prompted the thought that if Van Gaal is right, if it really is about organisation rather than players, maybe the transfer market is an extraordinary scam in which almost all of football is complicit. Perhaps, with a few outliers, the vast majority of footballers aren’t really that different from each other. There is a sense in which everyone benefits from transfers. Players can use the constant state of flux to negotiate better deals or to manoeuvre their passage away from a club if they are not getting a game or if they have fallen out with the manager. Agents love transfers because that’s how they generate most of their income. The obsession with transfers is good for managers because it means they can always promise jam tomorrow, vowing that everything will be fine “if we can just add two or three players in January”. It’s good for scouts and for directors of football and the mysterious men who sit on transfer committees because it provides them with a role and gives them a sense of purpose. It’s great for the media because it gives us something to talk about; transfer activity is a central pillar of the soap opera of modern football coverage. Fans, the consumers of that soap opera, love it because it keeps the story fresh, and because it offers hope that with one new forward or a slightly quicker right-winger, then maybe everything will suddenly be all right. Even club owners, you suspect, love it: for those lower down the chain transfers are a way of generating revenue; for those at the top, transfers are becoming almost a marketing activity in their own right. Real Madrid seem obsessed by the world transfer record because they want always to be the club that owns the most expensive player in the world. The pursuit of the Norwegian 16-year-old Martin Odegaard has felt at times as though is was more about the super-clubs acquiring a status symbol than about his abilities as a player: everybody wanted to be able to say, “Look, we signed this wunderkid.” What would happen if a club adopted a policy of consciously disengaging from transfer activity? What if a club decided that, from 2018, say, they would limit themselves to three signings a year to plug obvious gaps and focused instead on youth production? Would one of the lower-mid-table Premier League strivers – a Sunderland, a Stoke or an Aston Villa say – really be worse off if, instead of expending huge amounts of energy buying and selling to stand still, decided instead to build a philosophy from the ground up, clearing their debts as they did so? There would be short-term risk, of course, but the potential upside would be a team of local players – or at least players with an emotional attachment to the club – playing a co-ordinated form of football that regular practice had made instinctive in them from an early age. It’s a lovely thought, but the example of Southampton and their remarkably productive academy perhaps shows what happens if you do that and have success: richer teams simply come along and buy your best talent and you’re forced to buy to patch the holes in a ravaged squad. And so the cycle turns again. The transfer market maybe little more than a mill that takes in money and players at end and spews out money and stories at the other, but it is one on which so many people are invested, that is so fundamental to the fabric of English football that it’s hard to see how we can ever get off. Even if some lone rebel does start coaching rather than buying, all they will do is create exciting fresh blood for the market. It’s a machine English football created and to which it is now subservient.",profile/jonathanwilson,Jonathan,Wilson
192,2015-01-02T10:00:08Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jan/02/fa-cup-third-round-10-things-to-watch,FA Cup third round: 10 things to watch out for,football,Football,The Guardian,"1) The Turnbull family’s big day When Phil and Stephen Turnbull pull on their jerseys this weekend, they will, obviously, be thinking of the 1876 FA Cup final. Oh yes. That of course was when no less than three sets of brother played in the grand showpiece – Francis and Hubert Heron, Edward and Alfred Lyttelton and Albert and Charles Meysey-Thompson – and the match was marked by a sensational and highly controversial occurrence when Old Etonians stormed back after falling behind to Wanderers and scored a 50th minute equaliser following a goalmouth scramble in which the posts were knocked down. The Turnbulls will be out to make history this weekend too, not, ideally, by vandalising any of the pitch furniture but rather by inspiring their teams to shock victories. Stephen is likely to be part of Blyth Spartans’ midfield as they seek to oust Birmingham City, while Phil will be part of the Gateshead side intent on inflicting more woe on West Bromwich Albion, who will have Tony Pulis in the dugout after sacking Alan Irvine. Paul Doyle 2) Hughton makes his Brighton bow Chris Hughton is back. Sacked by Norwich City last April after their limp slide towards the Championship caused the club’s board to lose faith in his ability to keep them up, Hughton has taken over at Brighton & Hove Albion after Sami Hyypia’s short and unhappy stint there ended last week. Hughton’s undoing at Norwich was his inherent caution, his failure to go for the jugular too often resulting in them dropping points, but he is a safe pair of hands in the Championship and Brighton, who are outside the bottom three on goal difference after Monday night’s 2-0 win at Fulham, will be confident that he can lead them to safety. Brighton will travel to Mark Warburton’s in-form Brentford with fresh optimism. Jacob Steinberg 3) Blue-sky thinking for Dover  Dover Athletic enjoyed a wonderful 2014 by winning promotion to the top tier of non-league football after 12 years outside it, their ascent being all the sweeter as they became the first team to progress through the play-offs (beating rivals Ebbsfleet United, to boot!) after finishing fifth in the regular season. They are now comfortably mid-table in the Conference as they prepare to try to get 2015 off to a dream start by inflicting more pain on Premier League strugglers Crystal Palace. Alan Pardew will obviously not want to suffer a defeat to such lowly opposition at the start of his reign as Palace manager but he may also be tempted to rest important players to prioritise the battle for survival (although Palace’s two most important, Mile Jedinak and Yannick Bolasie are about to jet off for international duty). Pardew’s biggest challenge will be to make Palace sharper up front but he will also need to re-introduce the solidity that the team showed under Tony Pulis – starting at the Crabble Stadium, as Dover, for whom Stefan Payne and Tom Murphy have been in prolific recent form, have hit 29 goals in their current 15-match unbeaten. PD 4) Worrying times at Everton Good luck finding an Everton supporter with something positive to say about Roberto Martínez at the moment. Martínez’s second season on Merseyside is not going to plan. Everton are making too many costly defensive errors, they look confused tactically at times, their attackers have struggled with consistency, there have been grumbles over a lack of variation and although the way they have attacked the Europa League has been commendable, it appears to have sapped their energy levels. Patience with their poor league form is increasingly in short supply and Martínez, who is starting to feel the heat, defeat to West Ham United would deepen the gloom. Then again, this could be the perfect tie for Everton. West Ham, who have not won at Goodison Park since 2005, are their favourite team and Sam Allardyce will be without Senegal’s Diafra Sakho and Cheikhou Kouyate because of the Africa Cup of Nations. “They report on the fifth,” Allardyce said. “So BT, they’ve put us on Tuesday night. We were all sick when that happened but never mind.” JS 5) Return of the Dragons Coming so soon after a festive season spent quaffing brews with old friends, stocking up on compilations of classic songs and watching movies you’ve enjoyed many times before, the third round of the FA Cup, though scheduled in the new year, rounds off a period of acceptable nostalgia. Mark Hughes may bask in that feeling more than most, as he spends this weekend surrounded by up to 5,000 residents of the town of his childhood, as Wrexham travel to Stoke City. That is about double the average attendance at the Racecourse Ground these days, proving just how many people are eager to embrace a reminder of the days when these two clubs were equals. In fact, Wrexham have even more recent happy memories, as in 2013 they triumphed in their first appearance at Wembley by winning the FA trophy. But most of the players who took part in that victory have left and manager Kevin Wilkin has been striving to reshape the side since his appointment in March. Wrexham are currently mid-table in the Conference – one place below Dover – but a strong performance at Stoke would help ignite belief in a Dragons’ renaissance, or at least warm the heart with memories of a fun past. PD 6) Wimbledon bid to upset the odds, again Wimbledon have already done honour to their heritage this season by beating Milton Keynes Dons in the Johnstone Paints Trophy, now they have an opportunity to recreate memories of their greatest day. No one can reasonably expect them to prevail in the remake of the 1988 Cup final, but then not many people expected Wimbledon to topple Liverpool back then either and, indeed, Wimbledon’s continued existence represents a mighty against-the-odds triumph. The club will do their utmost to write another chapter in their fairytale of the unexpected. PD 7) Yeovil Town seek to end their dreadful home record against – gulp! – Manchester United  The humiliation that Manchester United suffered at MK Dons in the Capital One Cup earlier this season makes Yeovil Town’s task all the harder, as Louis van Gaal will be even less likely to take this tie lightly. Having said that, Yeovil’s plight could counteract that warning, as their position - five points adrift at the foot of League One – and their form – three straight defeats over the festive period and just one home league win all season – could induce complacency in any opponent. Yeovil players, on the other hand, could be uplifted by the prospect of creating a career-defining shock and the support of a rare capacity crowd, assuming not all the spectators will be supporting the visitors. If United are below par, then they might just be floored by the Glovers. PD 8) Will Ipswich shock Southampton? For Southampton, this is a chance to make amends for losing to Sheffield United in their League Cup quarter-final last month. It was a major missed opportunity, comfortably the biggest disappointment of what has so far been an excellent season, but they will need to forget about that defeat when they welcome Ipswich Town to St Mary’s on Sunday. Knowing Ronald Koeman, Southampton will attack the FA Cup with vigour and he is likely to select a strong team even though the Christmas period has been intense, but they will still have to be on their guard against Ipswich. Mick McCarthy’s side are flying, second in the Championship after Tuesday’s 3-0 win over Charlton Athletic, and they will approach this match with no fear. Jacob Steinberg 9) Roles reversed for Sunderland and Leeds It is one of the great FA Cup moments, the astonishing double save from Jim Montgomery that allowed Second Division Sunderland to beat Don Revie’s mighty Leeds United in the 1973 final. Yet now the roles are reversed. Sunderland are the Premier League side and Leeds, to put it kindly, have known better days. Chaos is never far away at Elland Road, to the extent that nothing surprises their long-suffering supporters any more, and the sight of Neil Redfearn’s side hovering a point above the Championship’s bottom three after Tuesday night’s 2-0 defeat at Derby County suggests that the chances of them beating Sunderland look slim. Then again, Sunderland are hardly setting the world alight at the moment and Leeds have a habit of rousing themselves against Premier League opposition in the FA Cup. Manchester United and Tottenham are notable scalps in recent years. JS 10) A banana skin for Forest Anyone who was unfortunate enough to have sat through the final days of Stuart Pearce’s grim reign at Manchester City or by England’s performances under him at the past two Under-21 European Championships is unlikely to be surprised by Nottingham Forest’s shoddy form. A promising start to the season was an illusion. Forest were riding high in the Championship after winning six and drawing two of their first eight matches, before four consecutive draws was followed by Cardiff City handing them their first defeat on 18 October, since when it has all been downhill for Pearce’s side. They have fallen to 11th place, nine points off the play-offs, after winning two of their past 17 matches – their last win was on 22 November – and Forest’s confidence is fragile after the disastrous 3-1 defeat by Birmingham City at the City Ground last Sunday. A horrific 10-minute spell at the end of the first half meant that Forest were 3-0 down at half-time and although Britt Assombalonga salvaged some pride with a late consolation, Pearce would have been aghast at the way Birmingham exposed his defence with balls into the box from wide positions. Keith Hill’s Rochdale, eighth in League One, will relish the opportunity to cause an upset at Spotland. JS",profile/pauldoyle,Paul,Doyle

And privacy actions are rarer still. A relatively quiet 2014 in the English media law courts followed a relatively quiet one the year before. It says that “the predicted flood of litigation” seeking to explore the meaning of the 2013 defamation act failed to materialise. According to its table of media law cases, there were only 43 decisions in defamation cases in 2014 (compared to 52 in 2013).  There were no libel jury trials last year and only one full trial by judge sitting alone. (That was Antonio Serrano Garcia’s action against Associated Newspapers over an item in Kelvin MacKenzie’s Daily Mail column in April 2012: Serrano won £45,000 in damages). As for privacy, the blog cites the official statistics as showing only one was launched against a mainstream media title: AMM v News UK in November 2014. That involved the seeking (and granting) of an injunction against the Sun on Sunday to prevent its publication of information about a sexual relationship. It was the first such action against the media in nearly two years. It is also a reminder that superinjunctions - the subject of a great press outcry a couple of years ago - are no longer a matter of controversy. Inforrm points out that the most important media law case of the year occurred outside Britain - in Luxembourg at the European Union’s court of justice - between Google and Mario Costeja González, the “right to be forgotten” ruling.  Then there is the little matter of no-win, no-fee arrangements. It was suggested, by Inforrm and others, that recoverable success fees and after-the-event insurance would be abolished in defamation and privacy cases.  In fact, as Inforrm notes, libel conditional fee agreements “have, against the odd, survived another year”. Source: Inforrm blog",profile/roygreenslade,Roy,Greenslade

Trudging into a cold, dark January after the bright, buoyant excesses of the Christmas blowout, the shiny new products have to work harder than ever to stoke consumer enthusiasm once again and revitalise demand. But what exactly will be on display at the world’s biggest electronics trade show? What will Las Vegas offer to set the course for another year in technology? Cars, cars, cars A glance at the keynote speaker line up shows more car manufacturers than ever. From Ford to Mercedes Benz, car technology is likely to continue its long march to try to keep up with the rapid pace of technology development driven by the smartphone world. Last year saw electric and hybrid cars. This year promises more self-driving prototypes, all technically capable of ferrying passengers around without interaction but held back by laws and concerns about who pays when something goes wrong. While Google, the UK and others attempt to smooth out those issues, CES 2015 promises to be the year that ordinary consumers will be able to get their hands on a smartcar, packed with Google’s Android Auto or Apple’s CarPlay, banishing the ancient systems most will be used to. Their smarts will be limited to entertainment and navigation, rather than self-driving or anything related to actually piloting the vehicle. One step at a time. Android on the TV Android isn’t only going to invade cars this year. CES 2015 promises to herald in the rise of Android TV, Google’s second attempt at creating a smart TV platform after the failure of the confusing and poorly implemented Google TV devices from 2010. Android TV builds on the success of Google’s Chromecast streaming device, attempting to bring a smartphone-like experience to the TV rather than attempting to recreate a PC in the living room. A raft of manufacturers are expected to release new TVs with Android TV built in. Google has a chance to unify the befuddled mess of smart TV platforms that currently exists and make apps on a television something consumers might actually want to use rather than simply ignore. Wearables This year is set to be the year when wearable technology finally hits the mainstream. While CES is undoubtedly going to be stuffed to the rafters with smartwatches, the innovation that will make or break wearable technology is price. The sensors and technology needed to make the gadgets work is coming down in price, meaning devices capable of tracking movement, activity, heart rate and even sleep are now within impulse-buying territory and well under £50. “The biggest challenge manufacturers must solve is how to make wearable devices more appealing to the average consumer,” said Ben Wood, head of research at CCS Insight. “We need to move beyond ugly black plastic devices designed by middle-aged male engineers. Wearables should be comfortable and fashionable, and I’m expecting some high-profile partnerships between technology companies and fashion brands to come out of CES.” More than 40m smartwatches and fitness bands expected to ship in 2015, according to CCS Insight’s data. CES will give us a steer as to where wearables go next, whether it’s the wrist, smartglasses, fitness trackers or beyond gadgets into smartclothing. Shorts, shirts, underpants and socks The most exciting products to come out of CES are likely to be hidden inside innocuous-looking clothes. This year is predicted to be the year that smartclothing bursts out of the realm of elite athletes and becomes something available on the high street for mere mortals. Clothing brands such as Adidas, Asics, Under Armour and Ralph Lauren have already started showing off clothing for monitoring every little bit of an enthusiasts blood, sweat and tears.  From tennis and football to cycling and climbing, smartshirts, smartshorts, smartsocks and underpants will be pressing their electronic sensors against bodies and syncing it all to smartphones, ready to tell people what they already know: they must try harder. And that’s all before the sensor on the end of their racket or back of their golf glove has critiqued their swing. Everything connected Beyond such exciting things, the inevitable march of curved TVs and 4K high definition is likely to continue – one a gimmick, the other still lacking content – and that’s not to mention the platoon-full of tablets, smartphones, computers, cameras, bluetooth speakers and drones for both toys and photography. And that’s not to mention the “internet of things” (IoT) – a buzzword that has long promised to turn all our dumb appliances about the home, work and environment into an internet-connected mesh of devices all capable of talking to each other, and the people occupying their space. “The whole arena continues to expand, but a grand vision remains elusive,” said Martin Garner, connected devices and internet researcher with CCS Insight. “The market’s being held back by immature products, fragmented standards and ill-defined ideas about how we should be using connected things.” Will CES 2015 finally herald something tangible from the years of hype? The lights will certainly be bright in Vegas as CES rolls into town. But while every CES has promised to be bigger than the last, 2015 might just be the year when the technology industry wakes up to the fact that the excesses of the gambling capital of the world don’t quite fit with reality any more. Or perhaps not. • Our most anticipated video games of 2015 • Driverless cars to be tested in UK",profile/samuel-gibbs,Samuel,Gibbs
199,2015-01-02T10:28:07Z,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/02/uganda-african-trade-growth-and-opportunity-act-us-14-years-on,Uganda has little to show for African trade agreement with the US,global-development,Global development,The Guardian,"When Uganda recruited more than 1,400 women from rural villages and took them to the country’s capital, Kampala, in 2002, the east African state dreamed big.  The women were told that they would work in a textile firm, which would export clothes made in Uganda to the US under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa), generating a lot of revenue for the country. They were promised good pay, better working conditions and a “bright future”.  They were employed by Tri-Star Apparel from Sri Lanka, which had set up in Uganda to take advantage of the Agoa initiative. But relations between the company and its workers soon turned sour.   A year later, in 2003, the women went on strike, citing mistreatment by their employer and pitiful pay. Each woman earned just $40 (£26; about 75,000 Ugandan shillings at that time) a month. As a result of their protest, roughly 300 women were fired. Despite huge subsidies, including tax waivers and loan guarantees to boost its production, Tri-Star Apparel went bust in 2006.  Their dreams shattered, most of the Agoa women went back to their villages; others sought petty employment in the city. The episode was perhaps the first sign that Uganda would benefit little from Agoa.  The act was signed into law by Bill Clinton, the US president at the time, in May 2000. It was designed to allow goods from sub-Saharan African countries’ – except firearms – to enter the US tax and quota free. With more than 6,500 product lines eligible for export to the US under Agoa, including live animals and animal products, the initiative looked like a good deal for countries such as Uganda.  It was hoped that the act would raise production at home, boost employment and improve people’s livelihoods. Agoa’s architects reasoned that trade, not aid, could fight poverty on the continent. In a special advertisement supplement published in the New York Times on September 19, 2002, Uganda’s president Yoweri Museveni sounded certain of the benefits. “We are on the threshold of a strategic breakthrough,” he said. “We have carried out all the reforms and what is most important for us is market access. Now we have it. In five years’ time, Uganda will be a totally different story – once we can take advantage of what is in front of us.” However, nearly 15 years later, Gerald Sendawula, who was Uganda’s finance minister in the early 2000s, and pushed for the country to endorse Agoa, said: “We don’t have anything to show. I haven’t seen anything going to Agoa.” It appears some countries, including Uganda, did not have the capacity to reap fully the benefits from Agoa. Uganda has the highest youth unemployment in Africa, estimated at 62%.   Uganda has not benefited from Agoa. I am happy other African countries have. I would be happier if Uganda benefited too.  Yoweri Museveni, president of Uganda    Last year, Uganda’s exports to the US were worth $47m, up from $34.8m in 2003. Meanwhile, US goods exported to Uganda had reached $125m in 2013. Last year, Uganda’s top exports to the US included spices, tea, freshwater fish, crafts, and live trees.  Uganda’s neighbours are doing well. While Kenya exported goods worth $389.5m in 2012, Uganda could only manage $34.5m. Tanzania earned $114m that year. One of the problems is that Uganda has no major manufacturing facilities. It was expected to capitalise on its potential in agriculture, which employs three-quarters of the population, and cash crops such as coffee and cotton were to lead the way.  The landlocked country was regarded as one of the best cotton producers in the world ; it would have an edge over rivals in the global market.  Ironically, when Tri-Star Apparel arrived, the company imported cotton from Pakistan, even though Uganda had the capacity to supply the factory.  Meanwhile, Uganda’s position as one of the biggest producers of coffee on the continent has been eroded, with volumes dwindling and some farmers battling coffee wilt. The majority of Uganda’s exports – including coffee, vanilla beans, fish, cocoa beans and tea – already enter the US duty-free under the Most Favored Nation (MFN) programme, which means they are not counted as Agoa products. “Uganda’s first mistake was that it failed to empower local farmers to be able to produce for Agoa,” said Dr John Mutenyo, an academic at Makerere University’s school of business. “Yet this was the main intention of Agoa.” According to Martin Okumu, secretary general of the Uganda National Chamber of Commerce, the country was never ready for the US market. He argued that, instead, Uganda should have focused on markets closer to home in South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Uganda was earning $240m in exports from South Sudan annually before fighting broke out in the country in December 2013 – far above what it got from US, according to the Bank of Uganda.   “Are you going to enter the US market with tomatoes?” says Okumu. “We can’t compete with US farmers, who are heavily subsidised.” Unlike Kenya or Tanzania, Uganda failed to establish an Agoa strategy to mobilise and guide those producing goods through the initiative.  “It is in Uganda where an investor who wants land, or [who wants to] have a transformer connected to their factory, must see the president personally. Genuine investors don’t want such things,” said Fred Muhumuza, a senior manager at the audit firm KPMG Uganda and also a former adviser to Uganda’s finance minister. The World Bank’s Doing Business report 2015 ranks Uganda 150th out of 189 nations. The report cited red tape and high transport costs as big turn-offs to investors.  Erin Truhler, information officer for the public diplomacy section at the US mission in Uganda, said the countries who have benefited most from the scheme are those that “have done the most to create an attractive business environment, both for foreign investors and domestic firms, by encouraging investment and trade”. Agoa is due for renewal in September, and Uganda will be seeking an extension. Last month, Museveni announced a new firm, Fine Spinners Uganda, to lead the country’s Agoa efforts if it is extended. The firm will process and export textiles. “We have not benefited from Agoa,” he said. “I am happy that other African countries are benefiting. I would be happier if Uganda benefited too.”",profile/alon-mwesigwa,mwesigwa,alon
200,2015-01-02T10:29:56Z,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/02/why-grow-up-neiman-juvenescence-pogue-harrison-review,"Why Grow Up? by Susan Neiman, and Juvenescence by Robert Pogue Harrison – review",books,Books,The Guardian,"How is it that a culture so cynical about the possibility of change expends so much energy fighting the one fact that there is no meaningful possibility of changing? On ad hoardings in bus shelters across the land, the unfeasibly smooth brows or glossy black beards of middle-aged women and men stare in defiance of the “signs of ageing”, as though appearing to be two ages at once made us look desirable rather than creepy. Or, above the injunction to “Live young” in an Evian ad, a diptych of baby and adult faces sport the same expression (is the ad laughing with or at us? Is its real punchline the infantile credulousness with which we fork out good money for water?). Idealisation, Melanie Klein posited, is only the mirror image of contempt, and nowhere does her insight resonate more than in regard to our so-called worship of youth. In what sense can a society which subjects young people to unrelenting social, emotional and physical pressures and anxieties, all the while assuring them they are living the best years of their lives, be meaningfully said to worship or even to like youth? Susan Neiman’s Why Grow Up? is a spirited philosophical defence of the aspiration to maturity. As she sagely observes, by clinging impotently to youth, we impoverish youth and maturity alike. The vindictive subtext of the message that youth is the pinnacle of life, after all, is that things will only get worse. What better recipe for splitting our lives between an infantilised first act and its increasingly embittered aftermath? In Juvenescence, a penetrating and impressively omnivorous “cultural history of our age”, Robert Pogue Harrison identifies the same malign ambivalence in the collective drive to make ourselves younger in “looks, behaviour, mentality, lifestyles and, above all, desires”. Our age’s self-defeating ruse is to give the younger generations sovereignty over culture, all the while depriving them of the “idleness, shelter and solitude” needed to cultivate an authentically creative life. Our world, Harrison argues, has become as rich in genius – in the proliferation of techno-scientific innovation – as it is poor in wisdom, defined by Hannah Arendt as a loving concern for the continuity of the world. Without that, novelty becomes both blind and tyrannical – think of those snaking queues to replace a mobile phone with its barely distinguishable upgrade, signalling at once the blindness of consumer desire and a yearning for even the most sham and threadbare sense of continuity and belonging. Both books address our era’s tendency to set youth and age in facile opposition to one another, a tendency that gives rise, Neiman argues, to the most pernicious distortions of political life. In a consumer society, adulthood is confused with the capacity to accumulate overpriced toys, while “ideas of a more just and humane world are portrayed as childish dreams”. That water ad neatly captures this sinister inversion; “living young” means regression to the ingratiating cuteness of the baby, to a smiling docility into which anger, curiosity, confusion or any other qualities of an actual young life will never intrude. Growing up, on the other hand, has come to be identified with the cynical resignation that responds to any protest against the present state of the world, or aspirations for its future, with amused condescension. In the language of moral philosophy, we don’t dare invoke what ought to be against what is, for fear of seeming unworldly. It’s a fear that is itself (a nicely wry observation, this) chronically adolescent, “born of a time when few things feel worse than being less grownup than your peers”. So how, when the force of an entire culture seems to be ranged against maturity, can we make a serious case for growing up? The question takes Neiman to debates at the heart of Enlightenment moral philosophy. In her version of the story, the chilling and admirable villain is David Hume, the great demolition man of all our fond metaphysical presuppositions – “that the sun will rise tomorrow morning, that killing your father is an unspeakable crime, even that any one event ever caused another”. Hume’s point is that morality doesn’t belong to the world of facts, so that we’re never authorised to say that something “is” wrong or right. Killing your father is doubtless a messy and distressing business, but any inference of its objective immorality from its subjective unpleasantness is what we would now call a psychological projection. Assertions of right and wrong derive from feelings, not facts, and the outrage you may feel in the face of this claim only proves its point. This Humean scepticism has crept insidiously into our culture. In today’s travesty of maturity, the conviction that things ought to be different to the way they are is dismissed as chimerical, an effect of the childish narcissism that confuses subjective sentiments with objective truths. To this disingenuous brutalism, Neiman opposes the precarious task set by Hume’s great philosophical antagonist, Immanuel Kant, of learning “the difference between is and ought without ever giving up on either”. In the face of contradictory demands to “stay young” on the one hand and to “get serious and stop dreaming” on the other, argues Neiman, the most subversive aspiration would be to maintain contact between youthful hope and mature clarity of vision. Harrison’s sense of our juvenile malaise is not far removed from Neiman’s. Drawing on Stephen Jay Gould’s controversial thesis of biological “neoteny”, which argues for the persistence of juvenile features in the adult organism, Harrison suggests a cultural neoteny, whereby “the synthetic forces of wisdom” are perpetually rejuvenated by “the insurgent forces of genius”. Countless dead civilisations warn us against an excess of wisdom over genius. But the ominous spectre of our own time is just the inverse: genius without wisdom brings not rejuvenation but “juvenilisation”, a syndrome that “gives youth a premature old age and old age a callow youthfulness”. Juvenescence often seems to want to breathe wisdom into its very diction, not always with the happiest results. Harrison’s prose mannerisms can lurch uncomfortably into unintended self-parody (there is, he writes, “more celestial spheres than general relativity in my projected universe; more ancient Athens than world wide web in my cultural geography”). But perhaps the patrician tone is more canny than it sounds, a conscious antidote to the lazy knowingness and complacency of so much contemporary commentary. One of Harrison’s quirky side projects is Glass Wave, an alt-rock band made up largely of Stanford literary scholars, who sing edgy riffs on great books from Virgil to Nabokov. They’re actually very good, not least because they don’t pretend to be other than the happily over-read, ageing professors they are (though it helps to have an ice-cool younger woman fronting the band). Resounding through Why Grow Up? is a more distinctly youthful voice, sounding a little like the inspirational teacher that countless high-school movies make you wish you could have had. Neiman is an impassioned and lucid expositor of some very recondite concepts, with that rare ability, especially evident in her appreciation and elegant dismantling of Rousseau’s Emile, to convey the continued relevance and urgency of philosophy for our distracted times. Less persuasive are Neiman’s ideas on how best to grow up, an odd way to elaborate her call to critical independence of thought. As tends to happen when a philosopher attempts too swift and direct a translation from theory to practice, the resulting counsel – go without the internet for a week, learn foreign languages, do work you’re passionate about – is leadenly didactic, losing the suppleness and ambiguity of the original ideas. What these fascinating, expansive, occasionally infuriating books share above all is an interest in maturity as an ongoing internal relationship with, rather than a renunciation of, our younger selves. Given that focus, their minimal references to Freud – the unsurpassed thinker on the child’s hidden insistence in the adult – is surprising. This doesn’t appear to stem from any special hostility to psychoanalysis tout court – Neiman finds a nice analogue for her Kantian model of growing up in Donald Winnicott’s account of the “maturational process” as a process of gradual disillusionment. But Winnicott is valuable to Neiman in her vision of growing up as a striving for an autonomous, critically rational self. The evasion of Freud is an evasion of the infantile as the excessive, disturbing and finally incomprehensible dimension of our lives. To protest against aspects of our reality, writes Neiman, far from being childish, is to follow “the first law of reason itself. The principle of sufficient reason is simply the demand that the world should make sense. Injustice does not.” But how reasonable can it be to demand of the world that it make sense in the face of the overwhelming hourly evidence that it can do no such thing? What if the first task of growing up is, on the contrary, to acknowledge our compulsively comic and tragic defiance of this demand to make sense?

But my friends and I often found ourselves struggling for moneywhile we waited for our Erasmus grants.  Like many British students in countries such as France, Germany and Spain – the most popular destinations for UK students – I’d never lived in the land of the euro before and I found it financially difficult at times. Admittedly, I prioritised socialising, which probably didn’t help. Nonetheless, hindsight is a wonderful thing – and here is some guidance based on my experience. Open an overseas bank account Getting yourself a bank account in your new home country is an absolute must, as it will save you money when withdrawing euros. Ask people in your host country to recommend a bank and set up an international bank transfer with your bank before you go – this will make the withdrawal process easier and cheaper. Opening an account also meant I could receive the French housing benefit CAF, which provides big rent reductions for students. Buy a local SIM card Having a phone that’s not working, or being charged ridiculous amounts for data roaming, can be a networking nightmare. The solution? Buy a SIM card from a trusted phone company in your host country and ensure you can cancel it easily and at short notice. You should cancel your phone bill one to two weeks before leaving your host country. Smart food shopping Depending where you are, food shopping can be more expensive overseas than it is in the UK, but check out local markets for cheaper fresh produce. For anything else, the bigger the supermarket, the better – you’ll find countless deals on products that you can store. I’d also budget an amount for each week for food – and try to cook in bulk where possible.. Be sure to make the most of local treats. For me, French bread and pastries were both cheap and delicious. Savvy socialising  An important part of the student experience is going out. If you’re going to a club or bar, I recommend buying alcohol in the supermarket and pre-drinking like you’re back in first year. Join Facebook groups and look for student nights out, and show tickets, by joining the Erasmus pages and groups for your host city. This was important for me – my year abroad was my first time away from home, and my closest friends had been sent elsewhere in Europe. I also booked concert tickets before I left England. I wanted something to look forward to when I left my home city of Manchester behind. Thrifty travel  When you’re out and about in the daytime, look for your local travel office and buy a pass each month for trams, buses and other public transport. If you want to cycle, look on Facebook groups for a second-hand bike or go to the travel office for a yearly pass on intercity bicycle rentals. I rented a bike, but ended up walking everywhere because of my convenient location. Download the travel app for the town from the Windows, Android and Apple app stores, to stay on top of public transport news. For taxis, download the Uber app on to your smartphone, especially for deals if you’re travelling in a group. Uber didn’t exist when I was in France but like many students, I swear by it in Manchester. Make cut-price visits to other cities If you plan on going abroad, download free apps such as SkyScanner, Voyages SNCF and InterRailing EU, which enable you to book flights and train tickets and provide timetables. I’d also buy a railcard from your host country to save up to 50% on train tickets and receive deals such as two for one on train travel. For cheap coach travel between countries, try Megabus and Eurolines. When planning visits to other cities in France, Belgium and Italy, I was devoted to Hostelworld and Hostelbookers for cheaper accommodation. An International Student Identity Card (ISIC) costs just £12 and is your pass visiting tourist attractions for free. Take a student card with you wherever you go, as most museums and galleries have student deals. I regularly failed to do this, forgetting I was a student rather than a tourist.

Photograph: Guardian News and Media Archive   This was the advice given by William Percival Crozier, former editor of the Manchester Guardian, to Harold Wilson in 1937 following the future prime minister’s decision to decline a three-week trial at the newspaper. This statement reflects Crozier’s dedication to journalism, evidenced by his 41-year career at the newspaper. It also reflects a commitment to exposing truth through the pages of the newspaper which came to characterise his term as editor. WP Crozier was born in Stanhope, County Durham in 1879. The son of a minister, he joined the Manchester Guardian in September 1903, rising through the ranks to be become editor in April 1932.  In the interwar period Crozier sought to increase foreign news coverage in the newspaper. A network of full-time correspondents based in major European cities including Paris, Berlin and Vienna was subsequently established. Each correspondent developed their own sources, which enabled them to write informed articles on the foreign affairs of the day. These were usually published in the newspaper under the anonymous byline ‘our own correspondent.’ Crozier himself kept abreast of the latest issues by maintaining a voluminous and detailed direct correspondence with his foreign writers.     WP Crozier, c1940 Photograph: The Guardian   The Manchester Guardian’s approach to gathering and reporting foreign news was to prove particularly invaluable in the 1930s as the National Socialist German Worker’s Party began to increase in power and influence. In January 1933, just seven months after Crozier’s appointment as editor, Adolf Hitler became the German chancellor. For much of the next decade UK government policy towards Hitler was focused on appeasement. However, informed of a rising ‘terror’ in Europe by his foreign correspondents, Crozier saw it as his duty to expose the actions of the Nazi party through the Manchester Guardian. By now the paper had an international reputation and a small but loyal following in Germany itself. Though extensive coverage in both the news columns and leading articles Guardian historian David Ayerst notes that Crozier and his team sought in this period to “serve Europe when it was covered by a darkness which many, even in England, took for light.”  As editor of the newspaper, Crozier’s initial advice to his foreign correspondents was to “stick to the facts and avoid strong judgments.” He continued to try and ensure that the paper did not come across as one-sided, but inevitably many disturbing stories were published during this time. For example the paper was banned in Germany shortly after the publication of an article on 25 March 1933 by then Berlin correspondent Frederick Augustus Voigt. The article details the persecution of communists and social democrats by the Sturmabteilung (SA), the parliamentary arm of the Nazi party. Reports of antisemitism by the Nazi party were given prominence by the Manchester Guardian before other news agencies. Crozier’s belief in Zionism and long-standing support for Jewish causes closer to home is likely to have contributed to the depth in which the newspaper addressed this subject.    First page of a letter from FA Voigt to WP Crozier, 2 November 1937. The full letter is available to view here. Photograph: Guardian News and Media Archive   One letter held by the GNM archive provides a particularly interesting insight into how the newspaper’s foreign correspondents gathered information and fed it back to Manchester at this time. The letter is from Voigt, who had been withdrawn to London in 1934 and was now the newspaper’s diplomatic correspondent. On 2 November 1937 he wrote to Crozier relaying information he gathered on a range of European issues following a trip to Paris.  In the first part of the letter Voigt conveys the observations of one of his informants, an Italian diplomat named Antinori who acted as a liaison officer between Hitler and Mussolini on a number of occasions. The letter highlights a marked change in Mussolini’s attitude to Hitler during the 1930s. After a meeting in Venice in 1934 Mussolini is quoted as telling Antinori that Hitler is an “imbecile”, but by 1937 Nazi ideology appears to have had an impact on the Italian premier as Antinori tells Voigt: “the influence of ‘the new Germany’ on Mussolini in particular and on Facist Italy in general is prodigious.”  Voigt also describes a meeting with Camille Chautemps, then the prime minister of France, in which they discussed France’s supply of arms to Barcelona in the Spanish civil war which is argued by some historians to have been a dress rehearsal for the second world war. Voigt goes on to describe in some detail the prospects of the loyalists based on various sources.  The seven-page letter ends with Voigt commenting on Germany’s military strength and the “initial lightning offensive” which became known as the Blitzkrieg and in the early stages of the second world war proved devastatingly successful. Crozier forwarded the letter to Manchester Guardian Managing Director John Scott. With the benefit of hindsight, Scott’s reply about Hitler seems particularly insightful: “Most interesting and disturbing, the course of History can seldom have depended so largely upon the personality of one man.”    Letter from senior staff to WP Crozier, 30 December 1938. Photograph: Guardian News and Media Archive   The Manchester Guardian’s foreign correspondents continued to report from Europe as the decade wore on and thoughts increasingly turned away from appeasement and towards impending war. The unexpected signing of the Munich Agreement on 30 September 1938 was met with skepticism by Crozier and his foreign writers. At the end of that turbulent year the senior staff of the Manchester Guardian sent a signed letter to Crozier thanking him for his leadership. The signatures “by telephone” include those of foreign correspondents Alexander Werth and Charles Lambert. The country was officially at war less than a year later. Crozier continued to edit the paper but his health was beginning to fail. He died on 16 April 1944.  A sample of Crozier’s correspondence is held in the GNM Archive. Further examples can be found at the John Ryland’s Library at the University of Manchester.

203,2015-01-02T10:50:20Z,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/02/uk-manufacturing-growth-slows-three-month-low,UK manufacturing growth falls to three-month low,business,Business,The Guardian,"Growth in the UK’s manufacturing sector slowed at the end of 2014, raising further doubts about the government’s success in rebalancing the economy away from property, services and shopping. Manufacturing activity, which accounts for around 10% of economic output, fell to a three-month low in December, according to the widely watched CIPS/Markit survey of purchasing managers. The headline index fell to 52.5 in December, down from 53.3 in October and November. Anything over 50 is counted as expansion. Although manufacturing activity has now increased for 22 straight months in a row, the slowdown is a blow to government hopes of boosting British exports, a key plank of a rebalancing drive that is supported by the three mainstream political parties. Manufacturing businesses continued to win new orders, but largely as a result of domestic demand, rather than export orders. Many manufacturing companies were hiring new staff to clear backlogs of orders and employment in the sector has increased for 20 months in a row. Companies told CIPS/Markit that demand from North America and the Middle East was improving, while the picture for the eurozone was mixed, with some businesses reporting new orders and others recording a decline. A separate survey showed that manufacturing industry in the eurozone was hardly growing. The headline index was just in growth territory: it rose to 50.6 in December compared to 50.1 in November. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: “The latest survey provides further evidence of the ongoing slowdown in the UK manufacturing sector, with output and new order growth easing to their second-weakest rates during the past year and a half. Despite this end-of-year tapering, the sector still performed well over 2014 as a whole, with growth averaging at its highest since 2010. “The positives to come out of the December readings are the continued growth, further solid increases to workforce numbers, a supportive domestic market that is driving new contract wins and the broad base of the upturn across the consumer, intermediate and investment goods industries. The main weak spot remains exports, with overseas new order inflows stagnating amid weaker economic growth in key markets and the ongoing lethargy of the euro area.” Sterling dropped against the dollar to $1.5502 from $1.5585 in the minutes following the publication of the survey. James Knightley at ING Bank described the manufacturing data as disappointing: “The long-hoped-for economic rebalancing story is not playing out as envisaged.” He expects that manufacturing will continue to shrink as an overall proportion of the UK economy, given the relative strength in the service sector.",profile/jennifer-rankin,Jennifer,Rankin
204,2015-01-02T10:56:35Z,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/02/fare-rises-british-railways-should-be-renationalised-caroline-lucas,Fare rises show why British railways should be renationalised,commentisfree,Opinion,The Guardian,"It’s the first week of January, so it’s time for that painful annual ritual – the introduction of yet more rail fare rises. No wonder rail passengers have had enough. Fares are increasing much faster than wages, with regulated ticket prices having risen by more than 20% since 2010. Figures released today by the Campaign for Better Transport show what this could mean for a constituency like mine in Brighton. Average ticket prices have soared by more than 20% for Brighton-London commuters, for example, whose journey to and from work could cost the equivalent of 8.6 weeks of net earnings – more than £4,400. That’s 17% of the average regional salary, and a price increase of £745 under the coalition. And while today’s rise sees regulated fare hikes capped at 2.5%, the cost increase on unregulated fares, such as off-peak leisure tickets, will be left to train companies’ own discretion. Passengers in this country pay the highest fares in Europe to travel on services that all too often are unreliable, understaffed, and overcrowded. After two decades of privatisation, the private sector has not delivered the innovation and investment that were once promised. Moreover, private rail companies still remain dependent on public subsidies to run their services. But these same companies can then turn over up to an estimated 90% of their operating profits to shareholders. This blatant transfer of public money means that the public purse is effectively propping up a failing rail system for private gain. The Rebuilding Rail report, published by Transport for Quality of Life, conservatively estimates that about £1.2bn is lost each year as a result of fragmentation and privatisation. The irony is that some of the biggest profiters are the state-owned rail companies of our European neighbours. Yet that’s money that could, and should, be reinvested to improve our own rail services and reduce fares. That’s why on Monday, I will be joining campaigners from groups including RMT, Action for Rail, Compass and the People’s Assembly at rallies at stations all around the country to call for rail to be brought back into public ownership, with passengers having a greater say in the development of the system. We are proposing that the government would take back individual franchises when they expire, or when companies fail to meet their conditions. The enormous savings generated could and should then be reinvested in rail infrastructure, and to reduce the soaring cost of fares. This is no dewy-eyed throwback to a 1970s British Rail. The modern, efficient, clean and affordable services enjoyed in other parts of Europe offer a much better blueprint for the future. Closer to home, the recent experience of the East Coast Mainline tells its own story. In the five years it was run by the public sector, it returned almost £1bn to the taxpayer, as well as increasing passenger numbers, introducing a new timetable, improving punctuality and establishing industry-leading approaches to recycling and reducing carbon emissions. No wonder a government ideologically obsessed with privatising public services was so embarrassed by this success that it bundled it back into the private sector as soon as it could. My private member’s bill to bring rail back into public ownership is due for its second reading at the end of next week. I’d like to think that Labour would support it. Yet its policy of inviting public operators to compete against private companies is half-hearted and deeply flawed, and will do nothing to address the fragmentation at the heart of the privatisation chaos. Come on, Ed Miliband, have the courage of your convictions and join the vast majority of people in this country who want to see an integrated rail service run for passengers, not for private gain.",profile/carolinelucas,Caroline,Lucas
205,2015-01-02T11:00:09Z,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/02/best-crime-novels-review-roundup-charlotte-williams-stuart-macbride,The best crime novels – review roundup,books,Books,The Guardian,"   Set in Cardiff’s art world, Black Valley by Charlotte Williams (Macmillan, £14.99) opens with artist Elinor Powell consulting psychotherapist Jessica Mayhew about claustrophobia, following the death of her mother during a robbery at her studio. Elinor comes from an artistic family who claim to be related to Augustus and Gwen John, and her dealer brother-in-law, Blake, has discovered an as-yet-unknown painter he hopes will take the art world by storm: the elusive Hefin Morris, a former miner with a backstory that fits the myth of the lone, untutored genius a bit too neatly, and whose darkly evocative canvases symbolise Wales’s lost industrial heritage. When Blake is killed, it becomes clear that there’s a major scam taking place, but what is it? Although the mystery element here is fairly straightforward, what’s utterly gripping is the psychologically acute depiction of the slowly crumbling wall between Jessica’s personal and professional life as she struggles to adjust to single motherhood and her new, possibly compromised art‑consultant partner. This is the second in Charlotte Williams’s series featuring Jessica Mayhew, and sadly the last, as this extremely talented author died last year.    German defence lawyer Ferdinand von Schirach’s second novel, The Girl Who Wasn’t There (translated by Anthea Bell, Little, Brown, £12.99), is written in a beautifully understated style that matches his protagonists’ detached and rather abstracted view of life. The first part of the novel deals with Sebastian von Eschburg, born to estranged parents in a grand but neglected mansion full of mouldering taxidermy, who becomes a photographer and maker of provocative art installations. Approximately halfway through, the novel does an abrupt left turn to focus on the lawyer Konrad Biegler, who is to defend Von Eschburg when he is accused of murdering an unidentified and undiscovered young woman. The facts remain elusive, but if you can bypass the implausibility of the case actually getting to court, what follows is fascinating. As is often the case with this author, the defendant is unforthcoming about why he committed the crime, if crime there is … It’s an examination of the disconnection between truth and reality that is tantalising and disturbing in equal measure.    There’s a different take on illusions in The Zig-Zag Girl (Quercus, £16.99), the first standalone novel from Elly Griffiths, author of the highly acclaimed Ruth Galloway series. Set in 1950 in a raffish and seedy Brighton, during the dying days of variety bills, it begins with the discovery of the head and legs of a girl cut into three as in the titular magic trick. When her torso is delivered to him personally, DI Edgar Stephens consults Max Mephisto, a comrade from his army days, when they served in a special unit known as the “Magic Men”, whose purpose was to create illusions to confuse the Luftwaffe. Max identifies the dead girl as a former assistant, and when Tony, a “Magic Man” turned mind-reader, is found dead in the manner of another trick, it becomes clear that there is a link to the past. With a labyrinthine plot, a splendid reveal and superb evocation of the wafer-thin veneer of glamour at the bottom end of showbusiness, this is thoroughly enjoyable.    Despite the fact that the words “gritty realism” now seem inextricably linked, actual realism is, more often than not, less gritty than messy, inconsequential and arse-achingly dull. At almost 600 pages, bestseller Stuart MacBride’s latest novel The Missing and the Dead (HarperCollins, £16.99), in which he attempts “to convey realistically what divisional Scottish policing is like on the ground”, is a hefty as well as a risky undertaking. Relocated to rural Aberdeenshire, Logan McRae is spending his time rounding up escaped cows, placating dotty old ladies, trying to stop the local graffiti artist decorating billboards with giant willies and keeping tabs on the drug dealers. The central storyline, expertly woven in and out of all this, is the hunt for the killer of an unidentified little girl whose body is found washed up just outside Banff. The result is some slackening of tension – MacBride’s novels are usually fairly humming with it – but so skilful is the storytelling, and so strong the characterisation, that this window on to the world of some old friends proves both intriguing and engrossing.    The Locked-Room Mysteries (Corvus, £19.99), an anthology edited by Otto Penzler, is also, at a wrist-spraining 3lbs 2oz, a big hunk of book, with authors ranging from the well known (Edgar Allan Poe, Stephen King) to the obscure (Nicholas Olde and Vincent Cournier, anyone?). However, the concern here isn’t credibility, but – with crimes ranging from the mind-bending to the surreal – sheer, unadulterated fun. With a short biography of each author, this is perfect fodder for those long winter evenings. • To order these titles with free UK p&p call Guardian book service on 0330 333 6846 or go to bookshop.theguardian.com.",profile/laurawilson,wilson,

Inter have returned with a more realistic offer for the Germany striker, who was not a part of the Arsenal squad that lost 2-0 at Southampton in the Premier League on New Year’s Day.  The Arsenal manager, Arsène Wenger, cited a “tight groin” as the reason for Podoski’s absence, and the Frenchman smirked as he said so. Wenger also said that the 29-year-old had not trained since Sunday’s win at West Ham United. Podolski is expected to again be absent when Arsenal begin their FA Cup defence this weekend against the team they beat in last season’s final, Hull City.  “The first proposal [of Inter] was farcical,” Wenger said. “After, they come back a bit more serious. We will see what happens. Is the move inevitable? Inevitable in a transfer is very difficult to say but we’ll see what happens. Of course, Podolski is open [to the move].”  Podolski has started only two matches this season – against Southampton in the Capital One Cup and at Galatasaray in the Champions League, when he scored twice.

The hackers took the gaming service offline on Christmas Eve, preventing new users from connecting and registering their new PlayStation consoles, as well as blocking existing users access to online games and on-demand video streaming services. The PSN, which has 110 million users, was not restored until 28 December. Microsoft’s Xbox Live online gaming service was also targeted by the Lizard Squad’s attack but service was restored by Boxing Day. “Since access to PlayStation Network was impacted during the holidays, we wanted to show our appreciation for your patience by offering all PlayStation Plus members that had an active membership or free trial on December 25th a membership extension of five days,” said Eric Lempel, vice president of Sony Network Entertainment in a blog post. “In addition, sometime this month we will announce that for a limited time, we will be offering a 10% discount code good for a one-time discount off a total cart purchase in the PlayStation Store as a thank you to all PSN members.” Mixed reactions The news was met with mixed reactions from commenters on the PlayStation blog. “Have you no shame?? Disgraceful but it’s funny how the masses will praise this useless gesture, one can receive a bigger discount by searching the internet for coupon codes 10%, you are a joke Sony. You deserve what you got,” said a commenter known as Crniilabud. Others were more positive, while Sony was urged to “raise your security” and prevent it happening again. “This is exactly the right move. Essentially prorating our subscriptions for the lost time. Thank you!” said Thunder_Hokie. While Ponyohearts said: “Appreciate the offer. Hacks happen … what can you do?

The Lizard Squad has been linked with a series of high-profile distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. These attacks prevent legitimate users of services such as the PSN from connecting to them by bombarding them with bogus connections, overloading the service and taking it offline often until the attack ceases. The group recently launched a DDoS tool that could allow anyone to conduct similar attacks on targets of their choosing, costing between $6 (£3.85) and $500 per attack paid via the bitcoin cryptocurrency. • Sony hackers may still have access to computer systems",profile/samuel-gibbs,Samuel,Gibbs

What more bracing way to open 2015 than in the company of a man possessed of many a strong opinion running directly counter to the general line of thought? Jockeys are “unfit, fat and fragile”, he told a conference in Abu Dhabi recently. There is an element of provocation to the line and it should be said that Pritchard sees himself as a great supporter of jockeys, rather than a scold or a critic, and he concedes there are honourable exceptions. But he is scathing about some of the bad habits that currently prevail. “Jockeys live on a diet of chips, crisps and God knows what else, and fizzy drinks,” he says at one point. At another: “I could take you to the weighing room now and I’d show you jockeys before they go out to ride and you’d be lucky to see one warming up before a race, stretching. They all think they’re fit but even the ones who go and run round the track, they’re doing the wrong type of fitness. Why does a jockey want to run round the track? He should be doing intermittent sprints. He should be doing short, cardiovascular bursts. You can run round the track to burn off calories and that’s why they do it. But they don’t, in my opinion, train sport-specifically enough.” Strength in jockeys is overrated, he says. He extols balance, timing and rhythm, qualities which he feels are often undermined when a person forces themselves to lose weight quickly. Pritchard had the chance to test some of his theories last year when working with a team at Liverpool John Moores University, who, with the support of funding from Abu Dhabi’s Sheikh Mansour, made a study of weight control. Twenty jockeys signed up and were found to have an average body fat between 12% and 14%, whereas Pritchard feels “any sportsman who calls themselves a sportsman should have a body fat of less than 10%”. He suggests rugby players would have trouble making the team if found to be above that figure. “The reason they put on fat is because they starve themselves, they dehydrate, they make the weight, then they stuff themselves because they’ve starved all day. The body, because it’s been starved … slows its metabolism down and then, when it gets any sort of food, because it’s anticipating being starved again, immediately puts it down as fat. All we did with these jockeys was feed them. We fed them five times a day. We made them eat the right foods.” Pritchard reports the new protein-based regime helped the 20 volunteers achieve something like a 20% improvement in their metabolism, which, he estimates, would allow a jockey to have an extra meal per day while maintaining their weight. Franny Norton, addressing the Abu Dhabi conference, said it had allowed him to keep his weight steady for the first time in his 27-year career. Other riders have since shown interest, so there is hope for a general improvement in habits. But it is a fair question how many will be sufficiently motivated to follow the diet when the food is not being parceled to them at regular intervals by academics. A more troubling aspect of the study concerned mental health. Pritchard reports 15 of the 20 volunteer jockeys could have been diagnosed with depression, two of them to the extent that they were at risk of killing themselves. He attributes that astonishing finding to “the diet, the lifestyle, the constant pressure of making weight, making weight. To manage that for the rest of your days and know that your career depended on it … ” Pritchard is hoping to secure more funding from Abu Dhabi to continue this and other lines of research. In the meantime, he sees a pressing need for jockeys to have a medical adviser they can call their own. The Professional Jockeys Association employed just such a person for six years until Thursday, when the funding, provided by Betfair, ran out. Pritchard feels the brief for that role was too narrowly drawn, was insufficiently proactive. He wishes jockeys could be offered more interventionist medical assistance. “The horse provides 99% of a jockey’s success. However, my argument is, even if you improve your ability an inch, that can be the difference between winning and losing. Jockeys have never really looked after themselves or seen themselves as athletes and they do really need to wake up.”",profile/chriscook,Chris,Cook

While fashion and home furnishing sales rose strongly in the week to 27 December, sales of electrical goods fell back 14.7% compared with the same week the previous year, with the overall total falling 1.4%. Sales were hit after shoppers splashed out during the Black Friday promotional weekend in late November, which proved the peak week for John Lewis in 2014. The figures were also depressed because Christmas week in 2014 included one fewer day of clearance sales than a year ago. “The fall of the calendar is such that we would expect to see some of this clearance demand fall into next week’s numbers,” said Mark Lewis, online director at John Lewis. The weak performance came despite a 19% increase in sales on Christmas Day itself and a 30% rise in click-and-collect online orders being picked up from stores by shoppers. John Lewis said Christmas Day sales had peaked at 9pm “as customers shopped from their mobile devices while also watching Downton Abbey in the background.” The department store’s performance will raise fears that profit margins for electricals retailers will have taken a hit over Christmas as shoppers spent their budget on early Black Friday deals rather than full-price gifts. Neil Saunders, at retail consultancy Conlumino, said: “The distortion of Black Friday is clearly not as helpful as retailers would have wished. In essence, it has been an exercise of selling the same volumes but doing so at a discounted margin. We expect there to be a negative impact on profitability at a number of players as further Christmas results filter through.” John Lewis’s sister chain Waitrose enjoyed a strong end to the year as sales of sparkling wines, whisky and turkey crowns helped the upmarket grocer outperform its bigger rivals, with sales up 6.5% in the two weeks to 27 December. Mark Price, managing director of Waitrose, said the chain had enjoyed better than anticipated sales in the run up to New Year’s Eve after a steady Christmas fortnight. “We had some good strong figures and like-for-like growth,” he said. Price added that a problem with the retailer’s online systems which delayed orders on the Sunday before Christmas by a few hours was a “minor blip” and that shoppers’ hunger for fine wines, pre-prepared and luxury foods had all helped lift sales. Sales of sparkling wine rose 20% in the two weeks to 27 December compared with last year while sales of frozen lobster were up 51% and “top-tier” luxury cheeses were up 35.7%. “As we’ve seen over the last few years people are moving towards added-value,” said Price, adding that Waitrose was likely to have outperformed its bigger rivals. The grocery market is struggling amid price deflation of between 1% and 2%. “It’s hard to see that growth would be strong,” he said. “Even if people are selling the same volumes their sales will be down.” The UK’s three stock-market listed grocers – Tesco, Morrisons and Sainsbury’s – are all scheduled to release their trading figures next week in what is thought to have been a tough festive season for the major supermarkets. The big four, which also includes Asda, are being squeezed as shoppers increasingly turn to upmarket chains Waitrose and Marks & Spencer as well as discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. Tesco boss Dave Lewis will also be updating the market on his plans to fight back against falling sales and profits, and it is hoped he will confirm an improvement in trading which has already been indicated by market share data from analysts at Kantar Worldpanel.",profile/sarahbutler,Sarah,Butler

I find that liberating,commentisfree,Opinion,The Guardian,"Our terror of death (happy new year, by the way) surely has much to do with a fear that it is out of our control. The lifetime risk of dying in a road accident is disturbingly high – one in 240 – and yet the freakishly small chance of dying in a plane accident generally provokes far more fear. We dread a final few moments in which we are powerless to do anything except wait for oblivion. So perhaps the news that most cancers are the product of bad luck – rather than, say, our diet or lifestyles – is scant reassurance. Most cancers are a random lightning bolt, not something we can avoid by keeping away from tobacco or excessive booze, or by going for regular morning runs. That’s something we have to live with. But perhaps the news should be of comfort. It is, of course, crucial to promote healthy lifestyles. Regular exercise, a good diet and the avoidance of excess does save lives. Yet the cult of individualism fuels the idea that we are invariably personally responsible for the situation we are in – whether that be poverty, unemployment or ill health. Cancer is more individualised than most diseases: all that talk of “losing” or “winning” battles. A far wiser approach was summed up by DJ Danny Baker after his own diagnosis. He said he was “just the battlefield, science is doing the fighting and of course the wonderful docs and nurses of the brilliant NHS”. The cancer patient, in other words, was practically a bystander in a collective effort. One of the heroes of 2014 was Stephen Sutton because of his infectious optimism and cheerfulness in the face of cancer. But his battle was about not letting cancer consume his final few months on Earth, rather than a superhuman quest to miraculously defeat the disease himself. What struck me about Stephen was that a situation that seemed nightmarish to most of us became an opportunity for him to take control of his life. It is what struck me, too, about Gordon Aikman, a 29-year-old Scot with a terminal diagnosis of motor neurone disease. There is no right way to die, but he has learned how to live. So that’s why I have some sympathy with Richard Smith, a doctor who once edited the British Medical Journal. He has upset many by suggesting we are “wasting billions trying to cure cancer”, when it is the “best” way to go. I certainly would not advocate cutting back on cancer research, quite the opposite – even if other fatal diseases don’t receive the same amount of attention – and cancer can be a horrible way to die. But his point was that it provided an opportunity to make peace, to reflect on life, to do all the things you always wanted to do – to finally have control over your own life. Other ways of dying simply do not provide that option, either because they are so sudden or because of the form they take. We have less of a say over how and when we die than we thought. That may be a cause for anxiety: it may actually frighten us more. I think it’s liberating. If only we learned to live like many of those – like Stephen or Gordon – facing death, taking control of their lives, we would be so much happier than we are.",profile/owen-jones,Owen,Jones

Miranda, in which the eponymous heroine finally married her long-term sweetheart Gary, was watched by 7.3 million viewers (27.6%) from 8pm on New Year’s Day. It was a big night for BBC1, which also had 6.5 million viewers (26.8%) for its 90-minute Roald Dahl adaptation Esio Trot, starring Judi Dench, Dustin Hoffman and James Corden, from 6.30pm. But neither could match the 7.9 million viewers (32.4%) who watched the second part of the Mrs Brown’s Boys Christmas special at 9.35pm, or the 8.5 million (32.3%) who watched EastEnders at 8.30pm, also on BBC1. The last-ever episode of Miranda was more than 2 million viewers down on the 9.5 million (37.8%) who watched the opening episode of its third series on Boxing Day two years ago, understood to be its biggest ever overnight audience. The sitcom’s absence will be felt by BBC1. It is one of the channel’s two biggest comedies, along with with Brendan O’Carroll’s Mrs Brown’s Boys, which is likely to return only on an infrequent basis. Miranda began life on BBC2 in 2009 before switching to BBC1 in 2012. Hart revealed earlier this year that it would not return. Elsewhere on New Year’s Day, BBC2, ITV and Channel 4 went head to head with a trio of free-to-air movie premieres. ITV had 2.9 million viewers (14.5%) for Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight from 9pm, ahead of the 2.4 million (9.8%) who watched the rather more genteel Quartet, the comedy starring Maggie Smith and Tom Courtenay, also from 9pm. Channel 4’s Kristen Stewart movie Snow White and the Huntsman had 2.5 million viewers (10%) from 8pm. Attenborough conquers skies. On Sky Sky 1’s latest David Attenborough series, Conquest of the Skies, featuring the unlikely attractions of the descendants of the dragonfly, the Atlas beetle and the blow fly, began its three-part run with 318,000 viewers, a 1.3% share of the audience from 7pm.

215,2015-01-02T11:41:32Z,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jan/02/mortgages-property-market-autumn-slowdown,Mortgage approvals fall to 17-month low in November,money,Money,The Guardian,"The number of mortgages approved for house purchases fell to a 17-month low in November, in a further sign of a housing market slowdown in the autumn. A total of 59,029 home loans were approved for purchases during the month, according to figures from the Bank of England, below the average of 63,191 recorded over the previous six months and down by more than 22% on the 76,574 offered in January. The seasonally adjusted figures from the Bank show that approvals fell in spring as new rules on mortgage affordability came into force, then picked up over the summer months, before dipping again in the autumn. The rules, which require lenders to carry out tougher checks on borrowers’ incomes and outgoings before they grant a loan, were introduced to prevent a return to the sometimes reckless lending seen in the run up to the housing market peak in 2007. As well as making it tougher for some would-be buyers to get loans, they also led to a drop in lending, as banks and building societies retrained staff and brought in new systems. The Bank’s figures suggest that after renewed activity in early summer, the market began to slow again. November’s figure for approvals was the lowest since June 2013, and combined with falls in the number of remortgages and other secured loans meant the total number of mortgages approved during the month fell to its lowest since April 2013, at a total of 99,566. However, the latest data covers the month before the chancellor announced changes to the stamp duty threshold in his autumn statement, which some estate agents and economists suggested could kick off another flurry of activity in the market. There is also a renewed price war in the mortgage market, with rates tumbling to new record lows. The Bank’s figures show the value of mortgages for house purchases fell to £9.6bn in November, down from £9.7bn in October and from £12.2bn in January. The total value of approvals dropped to £15.1bn, down from £15.3bn in October and £18.5bn in January. In total during November banks and building societies advanced £16.8bn worth of mortgages, the Bank said, while consumers made repayments totalling £14.7bn. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Economics, said the figures provided further evidence that the housing market had “ended 2014 on the back foot”. He said: “The falling back of mortgage approvals from January’s peak level was clearly initially influenced appreciably by the introduction of the new Mortgage Market Review (MMR) regulations that came into effect in late April ... However, the fact that mortgage approvals are still falling and in October were 22.4% below their January peak levels - after lenders have now likely got to grips with the new mortgage regulations - points to a clear underlying moderation in housing market activity.” The Bank also reported an increase in consumer borrowing through loans, overdrafts and credit cards during the month. Consumer credit increased by £1.3bn during November, above the previous six-month average of £1bn and the highest monthly jump since February 2008, before the credit crunch took hold. Credit card lending was up by £0.3bn, compared to a six-month average of £0.2bn, while other borrowing was up by £1bn, up from an average of £0.7bn over the previous six months. Unsecured lending has grown by 6.9% since November 2013 and is up by 8.3% over three months. In total UK consumers owed £168.8bn through unsecured borrowing. Archer said: “Retail sales surged in November as consumers took advantage of Black Friday, and this likely contributed to the high borrowing levels. “Relatively high consumer confidence means that people have become more prepared to borrow in recent months. It also may well be that a significant amount of people have recently been borrowing more due to the squeeze on their purchasing power coming from extended low earnings growth.” On Tuesday, the UK’s biggest building society, Nationwide, said that house price growth had dropped in the final three months of the year, as the frenzy of activity seen earlier in the year died down.",profile/hilaryosborne,Hilary,Osborne

I’m Hugh Muir. This month, something different. We’ll be returning to some of the people and issues we’ve talked about this year and finding out what happened next. We’ll also be touching on what we can expect in 2015. We’ve updates on Ebola in west Africa and how the world looks after climate change talks in Peru. Here’s what happened after we uncovered corruption in Mali; Nato’s pulled out of Afghanistan, how will that impact on development there? All of that coming up and more on this bumper Global development podcast from the Guardian.   And we begin this month’s podcast where we left the last: Lima and the Cop 20 climate change talks in Peru. You’ll have read the gist of it by now. Pretty hopeful. A key first step but plenty left to do. Let’s unpick that summary now with the Guardian’s US environment correspondent, Suzanne Goldenberg. She’s in Peru now. And our environment editor, John Vidal, he’s here with me in London. Hello to both of you.  JV Hello.  SG Hi.   HM Suzanne, let me start with you. We expected a compromise, one that no one was really happy with, that got us closer to a deal. Is that basically what we’ve got?  SG Oh yeah. I mean we’ve got an agreement that came out at the eleventh hour that everybody is unhappy with. So if that’s the definition of a compromise then this is a compromised deal.   HM Is that what was likely, that everyone was going to come out of this happy? One would have thought not?  SG Oh no, no everyone’s unhappy. Everyone’s a little bit unhappy.  HM Isn’t that what you thought going into it, that’s where we would be?  SG You know, what I think happened is that everyone’s optimism was boosted going into the talks because there had been this deal between the two biggest carbon polluters, the US and China. And they agreed between them to cut emissions. Money had begun to sort of dribble into the green climate fund. There was a sense of momentum. So then people thought, well, maybe for once we can actually accomplish something at these talks. And then, the inevitable roller coaster arc of these things, we thought the talks would collapse. And they did actually emerge with something that ticked the boxes for the big constituent blocks here. So I think there are some good things that come out of this judging by the very modest standards that we have come to expect from such meetings.   HM John Vidal here in London, all countries will have to make cuts in carbon use – is that enough? Is that enough to make you happy?   JV Yeah. It probably is a very good thing, but frankly these are voluntary cuts, so every country will be able to choose effectively what it wants to do, what it can do. So we’re going to get lowest common denominator stuff and we’ve no idea if that’s going to be in total anywhere near enough to get us down to the maximum of one degree or two degree centigrade rise in temperatures, which the cuts will need. I can’t personally see it happening. So all countries by end of March are going to have to say what they’re going to cut. And then, by November next year, the UN will have crunched those figures and we’ll be able to see exactly whether we’re on target or not to keep the temperatures down. And I feel we’ll be well, well, well away – and there’ll be an almighty confrontation in Paris next year.  HM Is voluntary not binding? Who do we have to keep an eye on; who are likely to be the laggards here?  JV Take your pick!   SG Everybody!   HM I suppose it’s good that they had some sort of agreed text but it does seem to water down previous commitments, Suzanne, on cutting greenhouse gas emissions. You’ve written one particular phrase “common but differentiated responsibilities” – what’s that about?   SG Basically, 20 years ago, when the international community began dealing with this issue, there was this idea that the countries responsible for the problem – which is the US and Europe, the rich countries, the industrialised world – should take responsibility for climate change, that they should be the ones that should cut emissions. Now what’s happened since then is that countries like China, India, Brazil have begun to develop, and they’ve begun to do so and to grow their economies on a very polluting pattern. In fact, China now produces more greenhouse gas emissions than the United States.   So the United States, and to a lesser extent Europe, has managed to reshape the nature of these talks so that, from hereonin, China, India and other countries are going to have to cut their emissions as well. So that’s a big deal, that that language is in there. You also see a sub-clause in there, so common but differentiated responsibilities means that China and the other emerging economies don’t have to do as much as the US. And then there’s another sub-clause that says, well, they actually do have to do something. So that’s a big deal.   HM That’s the devil in the detail though, isn’t it John, the differentiated responsibilities – one could see people and countries arguing about that until the year dot.  JV Hugh, it’s the key to the whole thing because what’s happened is they’ve built up this enormous resentment by the poor countries, which now are absolutely furious that the rich countries are not going to have to lead anymore. And this is unjust. This is a climate injustice of the first order. And so they’re not going to let them get away with that in Paris next year.  HM That’s interesting, because when you read the headlines you kind of think that’s good everyone has a common level of responsibility. But in one way it’s just the big countries palming off some level of their responsibilities to smaller ones, isn’t it?  JV What you’ve got is historical responsibility as well. The mess we’ve got ourselves into now is not actually very much to do with China and India, it’s much more to do with what happened 50-100 years ago in Europe and America and the industrialised countries. Now in the past, those countries took historical responsibility and said they would lead the world out of this mess. And now what’s happened is, as Suzanne has rightfully said, it’s everybody’s responsibility.  HM But doesn’t that just mean no one’s leading? JV Well, exactly. The poor countries don’t mind cutting their emissions, that’s not a great problem, I mean they want money to help them and everything like that. But they do mind if the rich countries don’t take a lead, and that’s what we’re not seeing and that will be the faultline later on, I sense.  HM Suzanne, is that the nightmare, that the poor countries go away with a piece of paper and it all looks very good, and then they get home and they read it and they think, “Oh, this is not what we thought it was, this is not as good as we thought it was”?  SG What I found interesting about this particular Cop, which is what they call these annual meetings, was that I don’t think you can, and this is a success from US and European diplomacy in a way, in that I don’t see that those distinctions quite so clearly between rich and poor countries. You’ve got the alliance of poor countries that has begun to fracture in all sorts of different ways. So you have big developing countries such as India, China, Brazil and South Africa. Then you’ve got this group of Latin American countries such as Peru and Mexico and Colombia that are going along with the US line quite clearly, to the extent that they’re putting money into climate finance. That they are not in some intermediate rich/poor group where they are helping to pay for other countries.   So you’ve got India, China the big developing countries; you’ve got the middle countries; and then you’ve got the poorest of the poor countries that have also been co-opted a little bit by the United States. So the big divide of rich country/poor country is shifting around a bit. And I think that is why the US and Europe have been able to reshape this conversation into this idea that everybody has to do their fair share rather than [say]: “Look, we’ve been the cause of the problem.”   JV I think the danger is we’ve got now very little negotiating time left before we get this supposed final deal in Paris. And it’s not in anybody’s interest to sign up to a deal which is not going to help them in any way. The big other elephant in the room is the finance, the money. And here the rich countries have really come up with derisory offers. Suzanne wrote a very good piece about this.  HM Give us some idea.   SG Basically, it’s a quarter of what they raised before. In 2010, 2011, 2012 they managed to get $10bn a year. Now after saying, “Woo-hoo Green Climate Fund”, they’ve managed to get $10bn over four years. And some of that is not new money, some of that is just moving money from one pot to the other, especially with Australia. And yet developing countries are supposed to take from this some kind of reassurance that somehow the rich countries and the middle-income countries are going to mobilise enough money to reach $100bn every single year by 2020. That’s a huge gap. HM What is that gap going to mean, John Vidal?  JV The gap is getting bigger, not smaller – that’s the whole point. It means that unless they come up with real, cast-iron assurances by October/November next year, unless we see real money on the table, these talks will collapse. I’m absolutely certain of it.  HM Suzanne, you’re leaving Lima this afternoon along with delegates and negotiators from around the world. What happens next?   SG Well, what happens next is that people have until March officially to really show what they’re going to do. They have to put forward a figure for emissions reduction targets. Now you’ve seen the targets coming forward from the US and from the European Union and from China; now the pressure is on for others to begin to put forward those targets. And countries are crunching those numbers and seeing what they can offer. And so by the end of March, hopefully, we’ll get an idea of how serious countries are.  HM Quick prediction from you, John Vidal, what do you think will happen in the next year? JV There’s going to be some grotesque arm-twisting, in fact call it bullying, from the rich countries over the poor countries. And money will be offered and there will be blood on the tracks.  HM OK. Suzanne Goldenberg, John Vidal thank you very much. We will be here, we’ll monitor and see if those predictions are right, here on the Global development podcast.   JW Hello, this is Jonathan Watts, I’m Latin America correspondent for the Guardian. For me this has been a year that’s been a mixture of elections on the political side, of course the World Cup on the sports and entertainment side; but underlying them all and dearest to my heart it’s been a story of increasing deterioration of the regional environment. And by that I mean we’ve seen more and more mining companies, hydroelectric companies, roadbuilders, loggers, drug dealers using the Amazon, the world’s biggest forest, pushing through it and transforming some of the world’s most biodiverse areas. Even in the best case scenario, all that will have happened is that the rate of deforestation has slowed down; it hasn’t stopped, it’s just slowed down. So more and more of the Amazon is being cleared. I’ve been here in Latin America now for two and a half years. The longer I’m here, the more often I’m visiting the Amazon and the more I’m coming to realise just how threatened it is and how it’s being broken up by all of these different projects that are now taking place. And we’re seeing this transformation not just in Brazil but in Peru and in Ecuador. So the news on the environmental front has pretty much been negative across the border, unfortunately.   Some of the most striking stories of the year, although they didn’t always make the front pages, have been about new infrastructure projects. And in particular last week and the week before that, I’ve seen the two biggest projects in Latin America. The biggest one currently taking place is the construction of the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam in Pará state, Brazil. This is well under way, and by August next year the engineers are saying that they will be able to close off the river and a few months later the first turbine will start to produce electricity, and the whole project will be finished by 2019. There’s been a lot of impact already. You can see swaths of area deforested.   The indigenous people have essentially given up the battle. In return, they’ve been compensated with new motorboats, four-wheel drives, iPods – you name it, they’ve been given everything that they asked for. But at the same time they’re saying, “Well you’ve given us all these things from your culture but we’re losing the essence of our way of life”, which is running water and a means of food because they used to fish in the river. So you’re seeing a lot of destruction from that project, although it will provide a phenomenal amount of electricity, 11,000 megawatts, which Brazil definitely needs. The argument, of course, is whether that’s the best way to get it and environmentalists would definitely say no. But it is a climate friendly, if you like, if not environment friendly way of producing electricity.   The other really big project that I went to report on, although it hasn’t yet started, is the plan for a new canal across Nicaragua. This will be a rival to the Panama Canal – it will stretch from the Atlantic to the Pacific. It will be, if it gets underway – and everybody in Nicaragua that I spoke to said it will get underway – very, very much bigger than the Panama Canal. It will be longer, more than twice as long. It will be wider, it will be deeper. And it will involve a greater removal of earth than any other project that has ever taken place, according to the engineers who are planning this. This will be an utterly transformative project; the whole GDP of Nicaragua is no more than $12bn a year. This project alone promises at least $40bn to go into the Nicaraguan economy. So you’re going to see a transformative effect that should propel development in Nicaragua, which is the second poorest country in Latin America. But at the same time you’re going to have a huge impact on the environment, particularly Lake Nicaragua, which is the biggest source of fresh water in Central America.   So these two projects – and there are many others that I could cite, but let’s just concentrate on these two – for me these are absolutely spectacular developments that are changing the face of Latin America. Yes, lifting living standards but at the same time putting a lot of extra pressure on the environment.   EGH My name’s Emma Graham-Harrison, I’m international affairs correspondent for the Observer, but I’ve just moved back to the UK after living in Afghanistan for more than four years.   The way the Afghans participated in the election, the turnout of the people in the polling stations – women and men in bad weather conditions – that was a fantastic slap in the face of enemies of Afghanistan, and a big punch in the face of those who believe Afghanistan is not ready for democracy. So 2014 was a pretty historic year for Afghanistan because you had the first ever peaceful, largely democratic transfer of power. The outgoing president, Hamid Karzai, had ruled Afghanistan since 2001. A lot of people had expected that he would try to hold on to power one way or another, perhaps do something like Putin and Medvedev did and create a prime ministerial role for himself or arrange for a puppet candidate to win the election. But in fact he relinquished power.   However, things haven’t been entirely resolved by the fact that he’s handed over power because although you have a new president, Ashraf Ghani, a very interesting man who’s a former academic, but he’s now got to move from the world of academia and theories into putting them into practice in a very, very difficult environment.   “This is the aftermath of an attack on the Afghan Intelligence Agency in Jalalabad. Six people were killed and over forty wounded when two suicide car bombers …”   EGH I think he’s got two main things on his to-do list: one is don’t be defeated by the Taliban, don’t let your government collapse. And number two is sort out the country’s finances; Afghanistan is almost bankrupt. It’s heavily dependent on foreign aid. Well over half of the national budget is provided by donors. The taxation system is very inefficient. The economy’s feeble. And he also has to deal with terrible, terrible corruption. I mean, Afghanistan a couple of years ago had the world’s biggest bank scandal, if you look at the size of the bank relative to national GDP; a bank called Kabul Bank nearly collapsed. The theft was nearly a billion dollars, $925m had gone missing.  Ghani, one of the very first things he did when he came to office was order the arrest of two of the main people responsible for that; the guy who had been chairman of the bank and another senior official. And that was a very clear way to send out a signal that he was serious about tackling corruption.   “The threat here in Afghanistan was from al-Qaida and al-Qaida training camps. That has been removed, and that is real progress.”   EGH But the Taliban definitely see this as a chance to assert themselves militarily to perhaps try and put the Afghan army, the Afghan police on the back foot. You know, very recently, there was a day where Kabul opened the day with a suicide bombing on an army bus that killed several people. And then the day ended with another suicide bombing, this time on a play. One of the very few cultural venues left in Kabul; they were actually performing a play about suicide bombings and the impact of them. And during the performance a teenage bomber detonated a suicide vest, killing at least one person and injuring many more. And the Taliban said afterwards in a statement that they specifically targeted that play because it was spreading lies about jihad and about what they were doing. So I mean you can see with an attack like this the Taliban are sending a very brutal but very sophisticated message.   HM That was Emma Graham-Harrison; and before that Jonathan Watts in Brazil.   Now to Africa. Monica Mark is the west Africa correspondent for the Guardian. She has contributed to many of our reports this year including our coverage of Ebola, and she’s on the line now. Monica, how has Nigeria coped with the outbreak?   MM Nigeria was basically able to draw on its polio surveillance system that’s in place because it’s one of three or four countries in the world where polio is still endemic. So that system could also be used to track people down … I think tens of thousands of contacts.  HM So it just had a better infrastructure to start with?  MM It had a better infrastructure as well … The Liberian man when he flew in he went to a private clinic because doctors were on strike for much the same reason that doctors are on strike in Sierra Leone right now: they’re not being paid enough and they work in dismal conditions. So doctors happened to be on strike in public hospitals so that meant that only one small clinic was dealing with this Ebola case and they reacted – it’s hard to tell what might have been the case if Sawyer had been exposed to a lot of people.  HM Let’s broaden out a bit because obviously the worst thing Nigeria needed I suppose was a medical emergency at the same time as all the other problems, particularly the security emergency that there’s been throughout a lot of the year. Talk to me a bit about that and how that’s evolved? MM It’s been a bad year for security. Nigeria has had a problem with Boko Haram in the north of the country for about five years now, so it’s nothing new. It was this year that 200, almost 300, schoolgirls were kidnapped. We’ve never seen anything on that scale before. So that was pretty terrible. But the thing was in context, those girls being kidnapped, not on that scale, but it’s something that’s happening every day. It happened earlier this week, I think about 40 women were kidnapped from a village in the north.  HM Once they’re kidnapped are they staying kidnapped or are they drifting back and we’re just not really monitoring the story properly?  MM Part of the reason why Boko Haram continue unchecked is because they’re almost sort of like Nigeria’s dirty secret. It’s almost as if they want to wash it away. And obviously Nigeria is a country of 180 million people, it’s a big country, and people worrying about their own issues on a day-to-day level; infrastructure’s bad, there’s no electricity, running water is patchy. So they try not to think about what’s going on elsewhere because it’s just sort of too much.  HM Those girls, we all read about those girls, their plight went around the world, are they still in the clutches of Boko Haram to any large degree, in large numbers? MM To date, apart from girls who were able to escape in the initial hours of their school being raided, only one girl … has been reported to have escaped. So yeah, it’s not a straightforward situation for the government because obviously they have to consider do they want to set a precedent for doing hostage swaps, and it’s very difficult to rescue even just one person who’s being held by Islamists who are not worried about killing their hostages; they have nothing to lose by killing them. So obviously if you have 200-odd girls, it’s pretty much impossible to successfully rescue them. So it’s tough for the government.   But one thing they don’t, as far as we can tell, progress hasn’t been made is in terms of dialoguing with this group. Again it’s hard to dialogue with a group that has the ideals that Boko Haram does. There seem to be moderate elements in the group and it does seem their brutality is kind of making people turn against them who initially may have sympathised with some of their ideals. And the government were not aware that they are reaching out to these elements, more moderate elements and making progress with them.  HM Is this is on the front pages there in Nigeria; isn’t there a continuing scandal? MM It’s not front-page news any more, it’s just sort of a background … It is covered, but it’s not really front-page news. With the elections coming up, obviously security is going to be one of the main campaigning issues so that might change over the next few months. And what we’ve seen even just in the runup to the primaries is a spike in bomb blasts going off in major cities rather than rural areas, which is where Boko Haram has been concentrating.  HM Is it really possible that good Goodluck Jonathan’s government can go into an election with 200-odd girls kidnapped, not having got them back, and still win an election?  MM In Nigeria that is entirely possible, and it’s likely as well that the incumbent will win. Not least because people are sort of, better the devil they know, that’s kind of their attitude.  HM Monica, obviously you’ll be looking forward to the elections in Nigeria but what else are you looking forward to, what will be the other big stories in the region?  MM It’s a big year for elections across Africa, and west Africa in particular. Togo, Benin and Ivory Coast will be particularly interesting to watch. Their first elections since Alassane Ouattara came into power in 2011, that election basically it triggered a sort of bridge that … civil conflicts that was the culmination of years of conflict that had been building up. So it will be interesting for the first time in a really long time to have a democratic election in Ivory Coast to see how people feel about the incumbent, Ouattara, who was when he came in he was an IMF, French-educated, former IMF director, a real technocrat. Some people had high hopes that he could restore Ivory Coast to the position it had once been in, which was the shining star of west Africa. So it will be interesting to see what issues come up around his election and how he handles that. And particularly in context of Burkina Faso’s recent political troubles. Blaise Compaoré who has been president for 27 years tried to extend the constitution and that led to his being swept out. So there’s a whole generation of young people in Burkina Faso who have grown up with just one president. HM I’m sure it will be good and bad, and fortunes will rise and fall, but do you go into 2015 optimistic for Africa?   MM Realistically, it’s hard to imagine there’s going to be any sort of dramatic changes, but I am hopeful that quite a lot has been learned in what’s been quite a tough year, and that that will have a positive impact going forward.  HM Monica, thank you. I’m sure we’ll hear from you on our Global Development podcast throughout 2015 but for now, thank you very much.   Let’s stay with west Africa, because the Guardian’s health editor, Sarah Boseley, has just been in Sierra Leone and Liberia. She’s been speaking to local health workers and NGOs on their continuing struggle against the Ebola epidemic. This is her report.   SB In large letters, on a hoarding at a traffic junction is a public health warning. It runs: “Ebola is real. ABC – avoid body contact. NHS – no handshake.”  MA “We’re trying to bring in some food items as well as non-food items to households that are quarantined. They are locked up, they cannot move out in search of food. So they rely on what we supply them.”   SB Mori Amadou is a project manager for Plan International. He distributes food to villages in quarantine. Are people happy to stay in their homes if they get the package of food?   MA There is … for them to go in search of food to get their daily livelihoods. If they are quarantined and they are given proper support then definitely there is no reason for them to feel bad about staying home in order to prevent the further spread of the infection. That’s basically why Plan International is helping with all this food and non-food items with support from … SB Is it difficult sometimes to get to these homes because they’re built in places that are hard to access?   MA Yes, it is really very difficult – as you saw today. In fact, most of the locations you really have to mind your steps, it’s rocky and bumpy and the footpaths are really narrow and they’re full of steps. It’s really difficult. There’s no car access. People have to help carry the load, so bring it as close as the street can take us to, or the car can take us, and then we go meet the people discuss with them, give them their papers, sensitise them on their package and what it entails and the reason why we are giving the package. And then we tell them to ask their neighbours who can afford to come and help them collect their food stock on their behalf.  SB Sierra Leoneans are being asked to make fundamental changes to their behaviour. It goes beyond funerals, where families now know, although they do not all accept, that they must not touch the body of those who have died. A hug or a handshake is now considered dangerous. That is hard in a tactile society.  MR Today, I’ve already picked two bodies.  SB And what sort of people were they?  MR Male. They are men.  SB In the western areas of Freetown, Mustafa Rogers works for the Red Cross burial teams explaining to families why their loved ones must be taken away.   MR My job is … beneficial communication. I always talk to the people who’ve lost their loved ones, encourage them, talk to them – just give them encouraging talks so that they will not feel bad of what is happening now or what has been going on in Sierra Leone, this Ebola crisis situation.   SB And I think you talk to them and also to all the rest of the community about the dangers of Ebola and how to keep safe.  MR Yes I did that because at any time we arrive at a community since this Ebola breakout come in this country, we have other people who have been telling communities about the dangers of Ebola. So when we come as volunteer Safe and Dignified Burial team, we’re also emphasise on it again that you should keep away from Ebola, don’t touch body contact – we have to tell them, you see, just for them not to come in contact of Ebola. And we break the chain; we try to cut the chain of Ebola so that the country will be free from Ebola.   SB Does the community get very upset when you pick up the bodies or do they accept this now?   MR No, they accept us because we are the volunteers of the Safe and Dignified Burial team. Whenever we reach a community we try to talk to them in a manner so that they will not get annoyed at us. So they appreciate … very much picking bodies in the communities.   SB This is Dr Ramona Sunderworth, an emergency paediatric physician working in Lunsar.   RS I have a bit of an advantage, since I grew up in Brazil, but it is very hot. Even before you get into … you’re sweating, and then once you get into it you have 10 pieces of equipment that cover you from head to toe, including goggles and masks and gloves – double, triple sets of gloves. So it gets quite wet in there, I must say. And in the tents where the temperature is a good 10 degrees higher than even in the ambient air, it can get quite drippy, I would say.   SB It isn’t the usual way round that things are in medicine. The patient doesn’t come first, actually, the rest of the community comes first. Because there’s no treatment, people have to be kept away if they have the virus so the rest of us are safe. And a lot of the doctors out there struggle slightly with this. This is public health rather than medicine. Obviously, everybody’s doing as much as they possibly can for those people who fall ill, but they have no treatments, there are no drugs. And so at the moment all they can do is to keep them apart.   RS We don’t stay in there for more than two hours maximum, usually about an hour and a half, maybe an hour 50 minutes – in the middle of the day that’s about all one can really be functional in those suits. But a part of it is just staying focused on the job you’re doing and being safe, being very aware of where you are, not focusing on the heat. Because the main issue is not the heat, it’s the safety of the healthcare providers and the care that you’re giving the patients, so that helps forget about the heat for a little while.   SB You can see the emotional danger they’re in. They want so much to cure these young people, and the older ones too, and are investing so much by coming here, that the deaths hurt, badly. They can still make the odd joke about Ebola – they need to be able to. One suggests a new way to get rid of persistent but unwanted male admirers back home: give them a kiss on the mouth and remark, “I’ve just come back from working in an Ebola treatment centre!”   But it’s not just Ebola that they’re fighting in western Africa. In Liberia, Médecins Sans Frontières, or MSF, is about to distribute malaria tablets to almost two and a half thousand families living in West Point, a slum area of the capital.   Malaria kills more people than Ebola, particularly pregnant women and small children. The symptoms are identical to Ebola – fever, headache, vomiting. That means there is a risk somebody suffering from malaria will end up in an isolation unit where they may pick up the lethal virus from those who really do have it. Claimonbes des Moulier is a logistician with MSF who has planned these early morning hand-outs in incredible detail.   CDM Today’s situation went pretty well. We started at 5:30 it’s now ten to seven and we almost distributed 2,300 kits, so for 2,300 families. People were well respecting the no-touch policy, which is great to avoid any cross-contamination. This is our main challenge.   SB You have to take some very serious precautions, don’t you, before you come into these areas.   CDM The challenge is about gathering people together. We have to make sure that they will not come all together after they reach the distribution spot to make sure they will not push each other, rush, fight and, especially, touch each other and trying to avoid, as much as possible, any contact. This is for all the beneficiaries. But on the other side, for the people that are working on the site, the distributor, the sensitisation team, drivers, supervisor, is to protect themselves from any contact as well. So we are following very strict rules of protection, prevention with some safe area where we are working in. We have some buffer area to avoid any direct contact with the people, especially at the distribution point.  SB And what is the reason for doing this; is it just to do with malaria or is it about Ebola?   CDM It’s about both at once. So malaria is still here and is killing a lot of people every year. Also malaria first symptoms – fever and weakness and vomiting – are quite similar to Ebola. So first of all that was to help the Ebola treatment unit to have less people in the … centre and in the transit centre. Now the idea also is to avoid cross-contamination for people who are suspected of having Ebola, but who actually get only malaria. And in case they are brought to the suspect area, they can be contaminated and become some Ebola cases.   SB MSF tells its staff: don’t touch anybody, don’t touch anything, don’t sit down. It’s not as easy as it sounds. A small crowd of women gather as I speak to one or two, and move in close. Then one of them, impatient of my attempts to understand the spelling of her name, grabs my pen and writes it in my notebook. Does it matter? Very likely not, but I felt obliged to spray the pen with chlorinated water afterwards, as well as the hand she touched.   HM Sarah Boseley there. And you can follow her Ebola diary at theguardian.com/global-development.   DS I’m David Smith. I’m the Africa correspondent of the Guardian and I’m based in Johannesburg, South Africa.   2014 the narrative of “Africa rising”, as it’s often described, really continued. There were many conferences for investors where they liked to hold up the cover of the Economist magazine from 2000, which described Africa as “a hopeless continent” and then about a decade later a headliner “Africa rising” or “the hopeful continent”. And particularly in terms of development, I think the two stars that are often held up as models tend to be Ethiopia and Rwanda. Both of these countries have done very well on many of the millennium development goals. Rwanda in particular, where we are slashing maternal mortality and great improvements in education and on other counts.   What of course does not get mentioned at these conferences, even the words are almost taboo, are issues like democracy and human rights. And human rights watchdogs are extremely critical of both the Ethiopian and Rwandan governments.   What we also are very concerned to watch and worry about is the ongoing conflicts in the Central African Republic and South Sudan. In December, it will be one year in South Sudan since the outbreak of civil war and there’s been a slight lull in the fighting really because of the weather, due to seasons, but a lot of the international aid agencies are warning that they expect a resurgence in fighting there.   And I should also mention Kenya: the president, Uhuru Kenyatta, had charges against him dropped at the international criminal court. In the meantime, a year after the terrible attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi, there was no let-up from the al-Shabaab militants. More attacks, dozens of people killed in cold blood, sort of raising questions about the Kenyan military operation in Somalia.   Despite that, actually, you could argue Somalia was very unusually one of the happier notes of 2014. Still some terrible atrocities going on, but actually in Mogadishu itself a gradual incremental change for the better. Journalists love writing stories about the first florist, the first laundrette; this year we saw the first cash ATM in Mogadishu and I think the first postal service for 20 years. But clearly still a long way to go there, despite the glimpses of optimism.   ADS I’m Alex Duval Smith. I did a podcast in September looking at how corruption is affecting development in Mali.   “There’s also been some flaws.”  ADS Are you referring to the presidential jet?   “Yes the presidential jet. So it’s created a lot of talk around it.” ADS The podcast looked at the impact of the purchase by the Malian government of a presidential jet and the extension of a credit facility of $200m for the purchase of defence equipment. This irritated the donors, in particular the IMF, which froze its direct budgetary support to the Malian government. It mainly looks like accountants are now happy with the 2014 books that Mali can present. It’s not entirely clear that the government is going to be any more transparent in future, even though it’s pledged that it will be.   AodB We, the IMF, we don’t generally take issue with specific spending items, but you can imagine if you were a donor you may want to reconsider your budget support.  ADS In the podcast we heard from Anton Op de Beke, who is the representative of the IMF here in Mali, and he’s become quite a celebrity. He’s seen by local civil society groups as really having produced the biggest shock to Ibrahim Boubacar Keita’s government since it was elected in August 2013. Another person we heard from was Coumba Bah. Interestingly, Coumba Bah has now moved on to have quite a prominent role in civil society, leading a good-governance NGO which is making waves.   CB Yes the Malian diaspora send a lot of money in. But I have a feeling that 90% of the money that is sent by diaspora is … for no business development whatsoever.  ADS I think it’s going to be interesting to watch the extent to which aid manages to penetrate northern Mali. There are attempts, constant attempts, to restart work on a road which is EU-funded, which will eventually connect Bamako and Timbuktu on tar – which is very important for the opening up of northern Mali; and in the process of opening up northern Mali, development aid, but also investment can reach the north. At the moment the north is still very much in the hands of smugglers and a parallel economy which essentially dominates the north.   CB But has anybody done an evaluation, an audit, of the productivity and the meeting of a goal. We put 30bn in this agriculture sector to have this much done in rice. Can we go and see if that rice has been produced. And if the rice has been produced, has it been stored properly? What is meant to be shipped out of the country, sold, to have value added, is that being done? But the government just sits and sends you a report.  ADS Since the election of Ibrahim Boubacar Keita at the end of 2013, Mali has emerged very much as a country whose hand is being held by France and the international community, in terms of its sovereignty, its defence and its development aid. The government has no social programmes whatsoever. It would be interesting to see if more pressure was put on the government to live up to, for example, the Abuja declaration, to spend more money on social issues such as health, such as education, which is still very much considered, it seems, by the government as somebody else’s problem; in other words the international community’s problem.

Photograph: PR   As play titles go, Truth, Lies, Diana is quite a come-on: author Jon Conway claims his piece contains new information that will shed light on the apparent mystery surrounding the princess’s death. Using transcripts from the inquest, public statements made on record and leaked official documents, this play-within-a-play follows a writer (played by Conway) and his descent into paranoia as he investigates and uncovers secrets about the Paris tragedy. Conway himself insists that he’s not a conspiracy theorist but argues that the establishment has yet to tell us the whole truth about Diana and her demise, ultimately leaving the audience to draw their own conclusions. Charing Cross Theatre, WC2, Fri to 14 Feb MC Stardust, On tour A young man has lost his heart and a wicked witch is in need of a new one. When a shooting star falls nearby, both are in a race to find it first. It may have been made into a big-budget movie in 2007, but Neil Gaiman’s twisted fairytale novel about seeking your heart’s desire comes to the stage here in a small-scale adaptation that’s on tour around the south-west. It’s quite a coup for Forest Forge, which is behind the show, and the Hampshire-based company should do it proud in Russ Tunney’s faithful version, which stages the story using just four actors and lots of puppets. It’s on the road until the end of January, so keep your eyes peeled. Various venues LG Bull, London    Bull. Photograph: PR   One of the theatrical highlights of 2014 was Mike Bartlett’s King Charles III (still running at the Wyndham’s Theatre, WC2, to 31 Jan). Now an older work by the prolific writer is opening at the Young Vic. Originally a companion piece to his Olivier award-winning play Cock, Bull is set in an office where three people are in the redundancy firing line; two ganging up on the other to keep their jobs. Making a direct comparison between playground bullying and office politics, this taut drama was inspired by a bullfight but takes an ambiguous stance: the mind games are enjoyable and the victim not that likable. Young Vic, SE1, Thu to 7 Feb MC The Borrowers, Newcastle-under-Lyme The tiny, human-like Borrowers live under the floorboards, only emerging when no actual human beings – or “human beans” as the Borrowers refer to them – are around, so that they can scavenge for leftover food or something useful that’s been discarded. But it’s a dangerous world out there, where a spider can be a monster and some human beings, if they spy you, will try to hunt you down and capture you. Theresa Heskins’s new version of Mary Norton’s classic story is set in the 1930s, has a klezmer-influenced score, and is very much a family adventure, while also considering how events in Europe prior to the second world war influenced Norton’s much-loved stories. New Vic Theatre, to 31 Jan LG Come Fly With Me, Salisbury    Come Fly With Me. Photograph: Robert Workman   Cabaret-style shows might be fashionable again but Salisbury has always led the pack with its themed musical winter warmers that keep out the cold in the early new year. This year’s offering is themed around the idea of holidays and travel, and is probably an appropriate choice at a time when people are thinking about booking their summer getaway. Poetry, dialogue and famous quotations pepper a musical evening that features songs ranging from Come Fly With Me to Sitting On The Dock Of The Bay and Mr Blue Sky. Salisbury artistic director Gareth Machin chooses the musical hits with co-director Adam Lenson in a show that steals from both musical theatre and recent pop, guaranteeing a first-class travel experience for all who step aboard. Salisbury Playhouse, to 17 Jan LG Little Shop Of Horrors, Manchester Alan Menken is best known for his Disney scores, including those for The Little Mermaid and Beauty And The Beast. He’s won a clutch of Oscars for his film work but he’s also the composer behind this joyous and quirky musical based on Roger Corman’s movie. It’s a show that grows all over you, as failing florist’s assistant Seymour suddenly discovers that things are coming up roses in his life when he stumbles across an exotic plant. He christens it Audrey II in honour of his love interest, Audrey, but the plant has an appetite for human flesh and as her cravings get stronger Seymour must decide how far he will go for the girl he loves. Done well, this 1950s-style spoof is huge fun and director Derek Bond should deliver without the need of Baby Bio. Royal Exchange, to 31 Jan LG",profile/lyngardner,Lyn ,Gardner

Although only a small portion of Bournonville’s 50 creations have survived, his trademark easy, open elegance and rhythmic élan remain. It’s been 10 years since the company last appeared at Sadler’s Wells, but this week a small ensemble will perform extracts from Bournonville’s works including La Sylphide, Napoli and A Folktale.

Instead, it is Derek Deane’s more traditionally styled version.

If you’re looking for the next The Fault in Our Stars, this is it.  And on a lowbrow note, the first week of 2015 also brings us the start of the latest season of The Bachelor, with “Farmer Chris” from Iowa in the show’s eponymous role. If the (unintentionally?) creepy promos of single women whispering to the man they hope to be their husband from a cornfield are any indicator, we’re in for an epically campy reality TV treat. Jennifer Gerson Uffalussy (@jennyalyse) I’m looking forward to JMW Turner: Painting Set Free coming to the Getty from London. I just saw Mike Leigh’s movie about the artist, which I loved, and interviewed both Timothy Spall and Leigh for an article at artnet.com. Doing so has helped me discover a latent fondness for Turner’s work. Jordan Riefe (@Jriefe) I’m ready for Lupita Nyong’o to slay the new year. Star Wars? Americanah? In my eyes, she can do no wrong. Her success is rare for black women and I’m just one of many women internationally looking forward to her next career move in awe and joy.  Britt Julious (@britticisms) I’m psyched about Amanda Filipachi’s novel The Unfortunate Importance of Beauty, a new Panda Bear album, and the returns of Fargo, Mad Men, and True Detective. I’m least excited about the clouds of toxic internet gas that will attend Jonathan Franzen’s Purity, whether it’s good, bad, or neither. Matthew Specktor (@matthewspecktor) If 2015 is anything like 2014, I’ll go to the Sundance, Cannes and Toronto Film festivals. I’ll attend symphonies at Lincoln Center and art openings in Chelsea. I’ll hear jazz at the Village Vanguard, bluegrass in the Hudson Valley and jam-rock at Jones Beach. But if the Fates were to dictate that I could only attend one event, that event would be next December’s release of Star Wars: the Force Awakens. I need to know if that beach ball droid can sprout legs and fire blasters, and what kind of grunts he (or she?) makes around R2-D2. I make no apologies for who I am. Jordan Hoffman (@jhoffman) I always look forward to the Sasquatch music festival. It’s the perfect size and packed with incredible music in a picturesque location. Also, I have always meant to head to Los Angeles for one of Film Independent’s Live Reads at LACMA, where Jason Reitman gathers together actors and comedians to stage live readings of scripts. Think: Jennifer Garner and Aaron Paul starring in the Breakfast Club.  Melissa Locker (@woolyknickers) On Nathan For You (Comedy Central), host Nathan Fielder ostensibly seeks to help small businesses, a la Bar Rescue. But Fielder knows nothing, and really the program resembles Da Ali G Show, poking at people for funny, unscripted reactions. So far he’s convinced a frozen yogurt shop to sell a “poo” flavor, made folks in search of a gas station rebate climb a mountain, and employed a mall Santa with a criminal record. Hilarious. Ben Westhoff (@ben_westhoff) I’m most looking forward to the release of Star Wars: the Force Awakens. It’s been quite some time since we’ve seen a Star Wars movie in the theater, and the last George Lucas instalments were such disappointments that this one has to be better. I’m looking to experience that old excitement of being in a theater full of die-hard fans, but with a fresh creative team to breathe some new life into the old space opera.  Brian Moylan (@BrianJMoylan) A new Kazuo Ishiguro novel will be published in March. I have been waiting 10 years for a new Ishiguro novel and I intend to savour every moment of it. I don’t even need to be told it’s good. I know it’s good.  Michelle Dean (@michelledean) The most important American art exhibition is taking place all the way over in Italy - where the American pavilion of the Venice Biennale will showcase the work of one of the country’s profoundest and most underrated artists. Joan Jonas, 78 years old and rocking harder than ever, is set to occupy five neoclassical galleries with her enigmatic, literary videos, drawings, and sound pieces, which usually draw on the artist’s travels, readings, and feminist conviction.

The tide is low and the silence is a far cry from Angola’s busy capital Luanda, an hour’s drive away. The river was an important gateway into Angola for slave traders during the colonial era. Now, the government has started to search for oil along the riverbanks, while Kissama national park is adjusting to life after civil war.  The park reopened in 2002 with species including elephants and the endangered giant sable antelope, imported from Botswana and South Africa, which had been wiped out by hunger and poaching. The Kwanza river is important to thousands of Angolans. There is now competition over catches between locals and established fishing lodges with modern equipment and speedboats. Kwanza Lodge is a popular weekend fishing resort, owned by a relative of Angola’s President, José Eduardo dos Santos. The manager is a South African called Manny Milner. Angola is developing as a result of the influx of expats and oil revenues in one of the world’s fastest growing economies. But the new Angola isn’t accessible to everybody. Nine out of 10 visitors this weekend are expats: Portuguese soap opera actors, Chinese engineers and Brazilian construction workers. Milner believes that eco-tourism is the future for Angola. “It’s a way to protect the rural community from a large-scale tourist industry,” she says. In 2016, Luanda will host a large professional golf tournament where enthusiasts of the sport will be encouraged to visit Kissama national park.  Angola’s official tourist plans focus on wealthy visitors who will sample luxury and stability experienced by only a minority of the Angolan people. According to Paul Wesson, a South African who runs Eco-Tur, Angola’s 12 years of stability have finally opened up the country to the outside world. “There’s always been interest,” he says. “Angola is the only country in southern Africa left for well-travelled people to explore, who’ve already seen the Serengeti and Kalahari. This is the final frontier of wildlife tourism in southern Africa.” One of the attractions of tourism in Angola is fishing, an industry threatened by demand from locals for food and tourists for sport. But, according to Roland Goetz, director of Kissama national park, fishing in the Kwanza river is unregulated, which could disturb both the river and the park’s ecosystems.    Manny Milner, right, is manager of Kwanza Lodge, a popular weekend fishing resort owned by a relative of Angola’s president, José Eduardo dos Santos. Photograph: Klas Lundstrom   In 2007, the regional thinktank Institute for Security Studies warned of the permanent degradation of the marine environment in southern Africa as a result of overfishing. Its report, The crisis of marine plunder in Africa, concluded: “This in turn will continue to adversely impact on food security and economic development, with coastal communities dependent on fishing being the hardest hit.” This is already the case in Namibe province, where fishermen risk their lives in small rowing boats on rough seas, lacking equipment and earning next to nothing. Not far away, modern fishing equipment and robust boats rest in the sand at tourist lodges. Namibe province accounts for 65% of Angola’s fish production and has in recent years gained the interest of the global fishing industry. Before the second world war, when Angola was a Portuguese colony, only Lisbon’s freighters were allowed in these waters. Now, with the market open to foreign investors, even Angola’s waters have become pieces of a geopolitical jigsaw puzzle. There is no way for Namibe’s fishermen to compete with the larger boats: while the former do small-scale fishing, vessels from South Africa, the EU, Russia and China operate in eco-certified areas.  Pedro Soares is a former fisherman who now works as a chef at a fishing resort. He’s worried about the Angolan people’s place in society. He wants the tourist industry to blossom and provide jobs, but not if it means catering only for foreigners. “That’s the case with the oil,” he says. “We need to break through as a people and claim jobs outside the service sector. As now, the region’s best fish goes to Luanda while we’re left with the scraps.” Soares believes that Angola’s young people can change this. “We must mature, educate ourselves and make wise decision[s], which I’m sure we’ll do. We want more out of life than just providing the rest of the world with oil and fish.” ",profile/klas-lundstrom,lundström,klas
223,2015-01-02T12:00:11Z,https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/jan/02/2015-social-justice-race-equality-rights-climate-business-marketing,2015 will be the year brands take a public stand on social issues,sustainable-business,Guardian Sustainable Business,The Guardian,"2015 will be the year of the pro-social brand. Pro-social brands are the next step for companies looking to morally engage with consumers. Driven by marketers who are moving beyond claims of sustainability and into strong stands on relevant social issues, this trend picked up momentum in 2014. It will be positively explosive in 2015. So what’s the difference between sustainable and pro-social brands? A traditional sustainable brand expects that customers will laud and applaud it for its charitable giving and its actions on key environmental issues. It’s the classic, safe, (usually) apolitical “vote with your dollars” approach: sustainable brands tell stories that cast them in the role of hero and expect audiences to simply play the role of starry-eyed hero-worshipper.  In the past, marketing based on sustainability or triple-bottom line approaches has been shown to drive a certain amount of loyalty. However, brands have also learned that they reach a point of diminishing returns.  The most ethical shoppers care about these issues, but the majority of customers hardly notice the claims of cleaner supply chains, fair trade or carbon offsetting. And even if they do notice, many have lost trust in such claims. Even much-admired one-for-one programs, such as those pioneered by Toms shoes, have lost their novelty. This isn’t to say that the era of brands striving to behave ethically is over or should end: cleaning up supply chains and pushing for fair trade are more essential than ever. But making these activities the core of a brand’s promise is not enough. What’s more, the failure of these sorts of marketing approaches often discourages brands from continuing these programs. Social issues transform ethics The pro-social trend will accelerate the urgency for ethical behavior. At the same time, it will transform how companies – and customers – live those ethics. Pro-social brands are more politically disruptive and inspiring than basic sustainable brands. Instead of focusing on what a brand has done internally to drive a better world, pro-social brands look outward to take a stand on key moral issues.  When they weigh in, they publicly prove that these issues have reached a tipping point of acceptability – and, in so doing, they increase the rate of change. A perfect example is the issue of same-sex marriage. In 2014, the Huffington Post reported on 27 major companies that boldly came out in favor of marriage equality. Taking this position wasn’t a safe stand, but it was a highly viral one. When a brand puts a stake in the ground on a controversial topic, such as carbon pricing, gender equality, racial justice, or even excessive corporate power, it sticks its neck out, adding fuel to a cause and challenging its customers to rally behind it.  The brand becomes far more participatory, making room for its customers to take on a heroic role by fighting for a more altruistic, tolerant, selfless world. The pro-social brand doesn’t say: “Look what we’ve done. Now buy our stuff.” Instead it says: “We’re willing to take a stand. Stand with us.” I’ve written a few times in the Guardian this year about how brands like Always, Airbnb and Fat Tire are building participatory tribes around key pro-social values. I also called for brands to take bold, political stands on climate change. Not long afterward, major corporations – including Coke and Pepsi – joined forces on Collectively.org to call for political action on the issue. Do brands have a place in politics? That said, there are a couple of obvious pitfalls to the pro-social trend. For one, some think the last thing the US needs is more corporations meddling in the political process. And for that matter, it’s worth asking if consumers really need big brands telling them what to think on key social issues.  I think there’s an important distinction to be made here. Pro-social branding is not about meddling in electoral politics; rather, it’s about taking an accurate read of the pulse of today’s culture. For decades, society has been trending toward wider empathy, diversity and citizen engagement. Pro-social branding helps to amplify that movement.  This connection between beliefs and consumption isn’t new: since the mid-20th century, brands have served as tools for people to express their identities and values. True pro-social brands will stay away from the ballot boxes themselves while encouraging citizens to raise their voices. Avoiding hypocrisy A second often-voiced concern is that, by making customers the heroes of brands’ stories, companies will be able to absolve themselves of cleaning up their own acts. Should we encourage corporations to offload responsibility on citizens?  I don’t believe that is much of a danger here. If pro-social brands take bold stands on an issue – as Ben and Jerry’s did on campaign finance, for instance – they take a huge risk if they then brazenly violate that stand in their own actions.  For example, if Facebook were to speak out in favor of same sex marriage or Always were to take a stand against discrimination toward girls, they would then be obligated to follow up on their statements in their own activities to avoid hypocrisy. If they then practiced discriminatory behavior behind the scenes, they would set themselves up for major embarrassment.  In effect, taking a controversial pro-social stand becomes a public commitment to better behavior. Thus, a pro-social brand is a sustainable brand – just a more involved and committed one. How big will this trend go? I predict that the most sensationally viral and impactful marketing campaigns of 2015 will be bold, political and highly in tune with the twitterverse. And I expect their message will extend beyond: “We’re sustainable.

Dinner had consisted of two scotch eggs, a packet of pork scratchings, a lump of cheddar and a couple of oatcake biscuits. Hardly the best fuel to help my legs recover, having run 120 miles in the previous 40 hours and still with a significant distance to go. I was crawling into my bivi bag, lying on the cold floor of a pub car park on the outskirts of Tamworth. The smell of urine was overwhelming. It was my second night sleeping rough and I was beginning to wonder what I was doing. A couple of months previously, I’d seen an announcement on Facebook from my favourite charity, Walking with the Wounded. They were launching this year’s Walking Home for Christmas campaign, which encourages people to walk home from their office in the runup to Christmas. This year the money raised was going to help homeless former servicemen and women. One in 10 homeless people in the UK used to serve in our forces. This statistic really hit me and I decided that I was going to get involved. As I’m an experienced ultramarathon runner, running the three miles home from my office wouldn’t grab anyone’s attention. I was, however, going to my parents’ home in Alsager near Crewe for Christmas – 160 miles away. Plan made: I would run back to their house over three days and, in keeping with the homeless theme, would carry all my kit, and sleep rough en route. Before I could back out, I put a statement of intent on social media, and that was it. No way out … At 8am on 21 December, I was outside my office in central London. I was going to be joined for the first 20 miles by ultrarunning legend Pete Chandler, five-time finisher of the 145-mile Grand Union Canal Race. This was a man I needed to listen to for tips. We set off, central London eerily quiet early on a Sunday morning. My bag, which weighed 10 kilos, immediately started digging into my shoulders and rubbing my lower back. This was going to be a long three days. Mercifully, the weather was compliant: cold, yet dry. We cruised up Edgware Road, heading out of London; we crossed a motorway and whooped with excitement having crossed the M25 and therefore “left” London. Only 15 minutes later did I realise it was the M1 and we had some way to go until the M25. Never mind. In almost no time we had hit St Albans, Pete’s stopping point. A quick embrace, obligatory selfie and he was gone. Then the slog started. Once I hit the other side of St Albans, it was on to the busy A5 and head on into traffic. I simply had to plug away. I hit Dunstable and a car pulled over; a couple thrust £20 into my hand, which really cheered me on. The boost was huge, my pack felt featherweight, and I sprung off again. Time to resupply on liquids again, and a McDonalds appeared. I knew I was short on calories and needed some caffeine so I created what at the time I thought was the world’s best sports drink. A large chocolate milkshake, supplemented with two double espressos and two packets of salt. Mix, stir and drink. I felt great for 30 minutes, then the effects of four shots of espresso kicked in. Wow. Maybe not the world’s best sports drink after all.  Darkness fell and I still had a long way to go to hit my target of 60 miles for the day. Perhaps starting my run on the shortest day of the year wasn’t the smartest idea. I hit the double marathon mark in just under nine hours. Pleased with this, I updated Twitter accordingly. Seconds later, there was a message from Pete: “Slow down mate, you’ve got a long way yet.” I was not going to ignore his advice, so made the decision to walk for the rest of the day. Plodding along the A5 dodging traffic was not much fun.  60 miles came up, and time to find a spot to sleep. I jumped a hedge into a field and settled down for my dinner of cheese, pork scratchings and whisky miniatures. I was cold, so cold. I struggled to get to sleep with the noise of the A5 ringing in my ears and nagging thoughts of foxes. I had seen a lot dead on the roadside. Was I in a fox-heavy area? Would they come for my food, or my face? In the early hours of the morning, something cold and wet touched my nose. A fox? Jumping up ready to do battle, I quickly realised it was the toggle from my bivi bag. It was not a good night’s sleep. At 6.30am, I heard a “Helllloooooooooo” cutting through the inky black of the night. My friend, Christine, had come to join me for the morning. She brought coffee and sausages with her. Fortified by these and a quick radio interview, we set off. Slowly.  Day two was always going to be the worst. My legs felt like lead. The pavement on the A5 went, and we were running towards traffic on busy roads. We did not make many friends with the drivers. Christine’s energy kept my spirits high and I was desperate to absorb some through osmosis but alas, it did not happen. After about 20 miles and a lot of moaning from me, she had to go home, so we said our farewells and away I went, playing chicken with the entire Eddie Stobart fleet. I eventually conceded defeat. Google maps might think it is OK to run head on into traffic on a pathless dual carriageway, but I certainly didn’t find it OK and I am not sure what the police would have said. I pulled out the maps. The original route was the shortest way possible so this would add on distance, but safety first. At least I’d get on to some slightly more scenic roads. Several hours of trudging through the darkness later, and another 60 miles down, I found myself in Tamworth. Only 45 miles to the finish. But my primary concern was where to sleep. Should I push on up the road to get further out of town? At this point, my legs gave me the answer. I couldn’t move. It had to be as close as possible. Pub car park it was, then … As I was questioning why I was doing this, I remembered: “I am running home for those who served our country and don’t have a home to run to.” That sobering thought put an end to my moaning and I drifted off. At 3am, the pub landlord woke me up. “Uh oh, he doesn’t look happy” was my first thought. Then he picked up my bag and walked off with it. “You’re NOT sleeping out here before Christmas mate, you are sleeping on my floor.” Three hours of blissful warmth were shattered by my alarm. Today was the last day, a big day. Time to get moving. I got the head torch on and set off in the dark. Finally off the A5, I was running along the A51, the adrenaline of the final day had kicked in and I was moving well. Then, I saw a vision of beauty. Karl Hinett, a good friend, running legend and Walking with the Wounded veteran had come to join me for a few miles. Karl was badly injured in 2005 in Iraq by a petrol bomb and his recovery and outlook on life are truly inspirational. The word “hero” has lost its meaning these days, being applied to goal-scoring footballers, but Karl is the true definition of a hero. Having him join me lifted my spirits and we ran along catching up about some of our running plans for next year, his immortalisation in a Grayson Perry work of art, and his lovely new wife. The miles flew by, then time for him to go. Another embrace and selfie, and Karl took off the way we came. Moving a lot faster this time!    Jules Roberts bedding down for the night during his epic journey. Photograph: .   My pace dropped, the novelty of running with a 10-kilo bag had really started to wear thin. My back was raw and bruised. My knees were stiff. I was still really struggling to eat, managing one energy gel an hour. My body was screaming at me, everything hurt, I was depleted, broken down, but I was still moving and I only had 35 miles to go. Easy. I rounded a corner and a cyclist veered off the road. “Hi, Dad, nice of you to join me.” My dad had rode down to keep me going. “Eh, lad, this is meant to be a run, not a walk, get moving.” It was a great few hours, father and son, talking about why I was doing this, and he updating me on how well fundraising had gone.  When it was time for him to leave, I had 15 miles to go and I was seriously motivated to get it done, but the pain in my knee was horrendous. I was reduced to a walk. Jogging was too painful. I resigned myself to the fact it was going to be four hours until I finished, so plugged along. Darkness fell again, it started to rain. At this point, I didn’t care. Alsager approached, one mile to go. I got to the top of my road, almost home … and the railway crossing barriers came down to let the London-Crewe train go past. The train I usually get.  I got to my parents’ house and they were waiting outside. A hug, a laugh and a quick reflection on the epic 165-mile journey, but this wasn’t the finish – the pub was 200m away. It was probably the slowest 200m I have ever covered. I managed three pints before I started to drift off, but that was long enough to briefly reflect. What an experience. I am a veteran of many ultramarathons, but this was the hardest I have ever done. The monotony and danger of running on the roads, the heavy bag, not being able to eat. Normally in a race, the lows are offset by highs, but the second day was such a constant low, it was a battle to get through. But the corresponding high at the end cancelled out all of the suffering. I have been blown away by the generosity of the public. People I have never met going online, stopping me in the street and donating. My friends and family have been incredible, too. This is what Christmas is really about: not the consumption, but doing something for others and feeling good about it. This is the best Christmas present I have ever given myself.

Photograph: Martin Charles   Stirrat Johnson-Marshall and others, 1940s and 50s Between 1950 and 1970, the historian Andrew Saint once revealed, a new school was completed every day in England. He also said that “no more ambitious, disciplined, self-conscious or far-reaching application of the concept of architecture as social service can be found in any western country”. Postwar Hertfordshire, with a growing young population, exemplified this achievement. At a time of shortages in building materials they used standardised and prefabricated elements to produce elegant, humane, light-filled places of education. They were designed by the architects’ department of Hertfordshire county council, within which notable individuals took the lead.  2 | London School Board schools    Gillespie primary school in Highbury, north London. Photograph: victoriansociety.org.uk   Edward Robert Robson, 1870s and 80s When universal education was introduced in 1870 it set the immense challenge of building thousands of new schools in British cities. In London, ER Robson came up with a concept that, using standardised details and elements, could be modified to different situations: some are bigger, some smaller, some have playgrounds on the roof. All have a Flemish-flavoured airiness achieved with brick, lofty windows, gables, white paint and sometimes terracotta. A masterful way of achieving diversity within repetition that also announced the importance of education in the often deprived places where they were built.  3 | Impington village college, Cambridgeshire    The grade I-listed Impington village college. Photograph: PR   Walter Gropius and Maxwell Fry, 1939 A pioneer of a new idea, which was to build schools in rural areas which, as well as educating children, could serve as a centre for the whole community – for which reason its centrepiece is a fan-shaped hall intended for film screenings and plays as well as school assemblies. It is a rare work in Britain by the Bauhaus architect Walter Gropius, designed during his brief stay here. English Heritage, which has given it a grade I listing, praises its “loose-knit, relaxed style of building, understated, modern yet user-friendly and incorporating traditional materials”. 4 | Hampshire schools    Woodlea primary school in Hampshire. Photograph:  lrb.co.uk   Sir Colin Stansfield Smith, 1974-92 Through the 1970s and into the 1990s, a Conservative county council, Hampshire, ran one of the most enlightened architects’ departments in the country. It produced a series of schools, often to serve the expanding suburbs of Hampshire’s towns. If until the 1970s standardisation dominated school building, here the aim was to respond to the specifics of individual places. They ranged from simple structures sheltered by a single large roof to more complex ones nestling in the landscape. The results were sometimes village-y and picturesque but never twee. 5 | Rugby school, chapel, theatre and other buildings    The Victorian gothic of Rugby school. Photograph: Ian M Butterfield/Alamy   William Butterfield, 1875 Thunderous Victorian gothic for the home of Tom Brown’s schooldays and the oval ball game. The school dates back to the 16th century, but its most impressive buildings are of the 19th, by the high-church architect of Keble College, Oxford, and other religiously infused polychromatic explosions. His buildings for Rugby are true to form, with a tower piling rather than soaring towards the sky, and patterns of tracery, tiling and blind arcades laid energetically over each other. His theatre building is bulky and forceful: it’s tempting to say like a scrum.  6 | Scotland Street school, Glasgow    ‘Nobility and grace’: Mackintosh’s Scotland Street school. Photograph: Thomas Lee / Alamy   Charles Rennie Mackintosh, 1906 Built to the standard requirements of the School Board of Glasgow, Mackintosh’s design makes a thing of nobility and grace out of the demand for separate staircases for girls and boys. Each is housed in a semi-circular tower that is baronial at first sight, but also has a lightness that anticipates the Bauhaus. The whole is then enlivened with subtle and utterly original ornamental touches. Mackintosh tried to raise the decorative specification, and budget, without telling his clients, possibly one reason why his career as a public architect faltered.  7 | Stowe school, Buckinghamshire    The landscaped grounds of Stowe. Photograph: David Hunter/Alamy   William Kent, Capability Brown and others, 18th century One of the great landscape gardens of all time, with lakes, follies, woods and vistas, with a mighty stately home attached. It happens now to be used in part as a school, which, as it was not designed for educational use, might be considered cheating. But it is such a terrific thing, to have hundreds of acres of park as a setting, that it demands inclusion. It also features Elysian fields, a temple of ancient virtue, shrine of British worthies, a Grecian valley and a gothic temple. Every school should have the same.  8 | Hallfield primary school, London    Denys Lasdun’s Hallfield primary school in Paddington, London, 1955. Photograph: Lasdun Archive/RIBA Library Photographs Collection   Denys Lasdun, 1955 Constructivism becomes playful and intimate in a school serving an impressive housing estate by the same architect. A long and sinuous central building sprouts one-storey pavilions, like leaves on a branch, which enclose friendly courtyards attached to classrooms. Actual, non-metaphorical trees grow in the spaces. And, lest the organic imagery is in danger of becoming too sentimental, the architect who later designed the National Theatre made it a robust and dignified building too. Intelligently extended in 2005 by Caruso St John, with buildings that complement but don’t compete with Lasdun.  9 | Hunstanton school, Norfolk    Where ambition meets the North Sea: Hunstanton school. Photograph: Alamy   Peter and Alison Smithson, 1954 Chosen with trepidation, for the contrast between its architectural ambition and certain practical shortcomings. The ambitious parts include its adoption of proportions from Italian renaissance buildings, and the wholehearted translation to East Anglia of the uncompromising architecture of Mies van der Rohe. It has his black steel and bare brick, and desire to create modern monuments. The shortcomings come with making a spare, glassy building close to the North Sea. It gets too cold and too hot, and the original underfloor heating only got the school warmed up when it was time to go home.  10 | Bousfield primary school, Brompton, London     Modernist favourite Bousfield primary school.

But people of judgment have pointed it out and the great critic Ian Nairn listed it as one of his favourites, which is good enough for me. Its beauties include courtyards, coloured panels intended to teach the principles of colour mixing, child-high windows and an external “watersphere”.

These relationships haven’t worked out, in part due to the overwhelming pressure of my sister constantly guilt tripping me into being straight. She is gay herself and in a happy, stable relationship, but I’ve always felt full of self loathing for being gay. Everybody thinks she’s wonderful and fun but she’s just plain horrible to me. We constantly argue but I always end up forgiving her, just for her to repeat the cycle and do something nasty again. She’s never offered me the love and support that I have her since we were kids and always kicks me when I’m down. I’m now starting to hate her. I have another gay sibling, also in a stable relationship who also doesn’t have a good relationship with this sister. I’m resentful that they are both open and happy, while I’m expected to live in the closet for the sake of not upsetting our parents. I feel the status quo is now having an impact on my health.

If you wanted to better yourself, you simply copied everything your local celebrity got up to, from the way they chiselled their flints to the arrangement of their animal skins. This turned out to be a better evolutionary strategy than trying to distinguish between genuinely effective behaviours and mere fripperies – in the time it took you to do that, you’d probably have been gulped down by a crocodile. If the alpha cave women had carried designer handbags, so would the rest of the tribe – much as they do today. There’s a kind of juju to following your heroes, and it applies to cooking as much as any other field of endeavour. So much of what we are taught is not actually necessary – it has just been passed down and accepted without question. I spend much of my life trying to separate the fact from the fairy tales. But sometimes you just have to give in. And such is the case, for me, with pork belly and crackling. If you Google “perfect crackling” you will find any amount of advice. (My money, as someone with a physics degree, is that the guy who talks about the temperature S-curve is probably closest to the truth.) But in all my experimentation, I never get better results than through the method below – passed down by the alpha cook, and my collaborator in this column, Jane Baxter. Guaranteed to produce juicy, melting pork and perfect crackling. And better than a handbag any day. Jane Baxter’s perfect pork belly recipe Preparation time: 10 minutes, plus overnightCooking time: up to 4 hours Serves 8 1.5–2kg piece of belly pork (bone in, if possible)1 tbsp sea salt1 tbsp ground fennel seeds Freshly ground black pepper 1 onion, cut into thick slices200ml cider Chicken stock 1 When buying your meat, ask your butcher to score the skin for you. Scoring the skin with deep, closely spaced cuts of the knife is critical for good crackling. A criss-cross diamond cut will give an even better result than straight slashes through the skin.    Score the skin: critical for good crackling. Photograph: Jill Mead/Guardian   2 Start the next stage the day before you intend to roast the pork. Place the meat on a rack above a tray or bowl and pour a full kettle of boiling water slowly over the skin. Pour away the collected water, pat the pork dry and then let it dry completely for an hour or so. Sprinkle the skin with the salt and rub it in all over the belly. Cover with a tea cloth and leave it in the fridge overnight. This will make it dry further. Dryness is good for crackling. 3 Take the pork out of the fridge an hour before you intend to cook it so it can come up to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7. Pat the skin dry with kitchen roll and rub all over with the fennel seeds and black pepper. 4 Arrange the onion slices on a baking tray. Top with the belly pork and roast in a hot oven until the skin starts to crackle. Check the pork every 15 minutes and move the tray around so that the pork cooks evenly (in a fan oven you will often get charring at the back of the oven). This part of the cooking is important to start the crackling process. When you feel confident that the skin is blistering, turn the oven down to 140C/275F/gas mark 1 and cook for a further 2-3 hours until the meat pulls away from the bone very easily. 5 Remove the pork from the roasting tray and allow it to rest. Pour off the excess fat and pour in the cider. Scrape at the pan to release all those lovely juices. Pour them off into a pan along with the onions and add some chicken stock. Simmer for a 30 minutes,while the pork rests, for a great gravy.    Simmer the juices with some good-quality cider for 30 minutes for a great gravy. Photograph: Jill Mead/Guardian   Tips • If your pork is cooked but the crackling is not quite crisp enough, just remove the crackling by slicing it away as close to the meat as possible. Put it back in the oven or under a grill to crisp up while the rest of the meat rests. • If you have leftovers, slice them into chunks. Place in a hot frying pan to crisp up. Drain off excess fat and add finely chopped ginger and garlic. Fry for a few minutes, stirring well. Finish with a good dollop of oyster sauce, cook for a few minutes and sprinkle with spring onions. Delicious with steamed greens and rice and the greatest hangover dish known to man or woman. (You can also make this from scratch using raw pork belly.)

I call it the Phil Mitchell. It consists of an effervescent paracetamol tablet, sparkling water, a slice of lime and a splash of Angostura bitters. It’s so called after an episode of Eastenders where Phil Mitchell, an alcoholic, balding hard-case trying to stay sober, starts drinking soda water enlivened with a splash of Angostura bitters after getting bored with orange juice. It is recommended to him by a not-entirely trustworthy barman who is himself a former alcoholic.    From Trinidad to Tamil Nadu, Angostura bitters have been added to drinks to add a certain pizzazz – even on Albert Square. Photograph: PR/Alamy   Angostura bitters is named after the town in Venezuela where it was invented in 1824 by Johann Siegert, a German doctor. In 1875, the company moved to Trinidad, where it is still made to this day. It was originally a tonic and seasickness remedy, which may be why it was popularised by the Royal Navy, who mixed it with Plymouth gin to make a pink gin. Colonial types in India developed the drink further by adding onions pickled in chilli vinegar to make a gin piaj, or gin pahit as it was called in Malaya. “Pahit” means “bitter” in Malay. Somerset Maugham mentions it in his short story P&O: “The Irishman ordered a dry Martini for her and a gin pahit. He had lived too long in the East to drink anything else.” The pink gin is synonymous with a particularly British brand of despair, so it’s not much of a surprise that it features in the works of Graham Greene. In The Heart of the Matter, Henry Scobie, an intelligence officer stationed in Sierra Leone, anaesthetises himself with the stuff: “There was always, sooner or later, bad news that had to be broken, comforting lies to be uttered, pink gins to be consumed to keep misery away.” Cheers! But you don’t need to be a washed-up colonial soak to enjoy Angostura bitters. You don’t even need gin; a splash of bitters is great way of livening up a soft drink. My new cocktail works particularly well as a mid-morning pick-me-up (that’s code for a hangover cure), the lime and the bitters disguising the chemical taste of the paracetamol. Angostura bitters is 44% alcohol, but you use such a small amount that it has no intoxicating properties. Unless, that is, you’re Phil Mitchell, whose soda and bitters led to him falling off the wagon spectacularly. Henry Jeffreys is a drinks writer based in London.

Isn’t yours? After all that Christmas food – the special cheeses, smoked salmon, and booze, the rich puds – our bodies could certainly do with a break. And a break they will get. It’s a new year. For us, the delicious laziness of the festive period has segued into an urge for change, for renewal and resolutions. This is a good time to clear the cupboards, declutter and, as tradition has it, clean out a bit of the old you. So we’re starting 2015 eating well, with meals that nourish without compromising on flavour. There’s kale in 10 Best this week, as well as a good dose of beans and broth from us. Too often people separate having fun and eating well. We have always integrated the two. Our mum is Filipino and we grew up spending time in a community of “aunties” (a term not necessarily for relations, but for any friends held dear) in home kitchens. There was always lots of chatter and gossiping, often singing along to someone on a guitar and, on celebratory days, “Magic Mike”, AKA karaoke. A constant throughout all of this, and ideal for feeding a crowd, were traditional one-pot dishes like tinola (a chicken and green papaya soup), sinigang (a tamarind-based soup/stew), adobo (a departure from the Spanish style – here meat is stewed in vinegar) and mungo: a mung bean soup. Mung beans. We know what you’re thinking. Mung beans have come to typify hippy cooking, too often sniffed at for their overstated health-giving properties and blandness. OK, these small green legumes are packed with a very high level of protein that’s easy to digest; yes, in Ayurveda, a bowl of mung is used for cleansing and fasting; and yes, in Chinese medicine they are believed to help with skin conditions, clear excess body heat and toxins. But does that mean they can’t taste good? No! Does it mean they should be written off as a bland fuel for worthy new-age types? Of course not! A hot bowl of mungo has become our go-to-meal precisely at times like the new year, when you’re in need of recovery. In the summer, we made up batches for friends after they had been to festivals, to help nurse them back to feeling good. And that’s the other thing: blissfully, you can cook it in batches – if you’re anything like us, “cook once, eat many times” is always a winning strategy. This gorgeously vibrant Filipino soup-stew of mung beans, enriched with meat stock, coconut milk, ginger and leafy greens is a long-term favourite of Jasmine’s and one that Melissa has finally got her head around (you’ll see when you make it that this isn’t the most photogenic of dishes – try not to judge on appearances!). The mung beans are cooked with pork ribs, prawns or both, and leafy greens, usually malunggay in the Philippines, a native root that resembles horseradish, thought to have medicinal properties. Otherwise known as moringa, or miracle tree, malunggay is such good stuff that it can now be bought in powdered form: it’s the new “superfood” on the block. Like bitter melon, it’s an acquired taste but, given it doesn’t grow here, kale, spinach, Swiss chard, and even beetroot or turnip tops would be good substitutes. So many of our Filipino aunties made mungo for us that, ironically, we’ve never made it authentically ourselves. Why would we have done when they already do it so well? However, we do make a storecupboard version that is a doddle to make for anyone trying mungo for the first time: it’s super-simple and an ideal restorative. The only thing you need to buy fresh are the greens, otherwise it’s simply a packet of mung, to which we add a tin of full-fat, creamy coconut milk, onions, garlic and ginger (perennial staples in our cupboards and fridge). For us, mungo is a comfort food that nurtures with its gentle coconutty sweetness and ginger kick. It’s a dependable dish that leaves you feeling light and clean. We tend to go to town on the ginger, which has anti-inflammatory properties – just the ticket for over-exerted stomachs – and slice it into rounds for speed, and because we like to chew on them. For a subtler flavour, grate your ginger in. Be generous with the onions and garlic too – they are rich in sulphuric compounds so, once again, they will leave you feeling brilliantly cleansed.    Take a leaf out of the Hemsley’s book and start out 2015 with meals that nourish without compromising on flavour. Photograph: Elena Heatherwick/Guardian   Mungo Be sure to soak the mung beans – overnight if possible – as it makes them easier to digest. It also means they will cook more quickly. Double up the recipe if you like – you will be very pleased with yourself when you come home late from work on a cold, dark night and you remember you’ve got a little pot of this waiting for you in the fridge or freezer. Better yet, this recipe makes a gorgeous hot lunch at work – just get a 500ml Thermos and you’ll have saved yourself your lunch money and put a whole lot of goodness in your belly. Serves 6 500g mung beans, soaked overnight in double their volume of water 1½ tbsp of coconut oil, ghee, butter or dripping1 large/2 medium onions, halved and then finely sliced2 thumb-sized pieces of ginger (or more!), skin-on if organic, sliced in thin rounds or finely chopped/grated4 large garlic cloves, minced1 can full-fat coconut milk750ml of bone broth (or use water)4 tbsp tamari, or to tasteBlack or white pepper (optional)1 large handful of greens per person  1 Heat the coconut oil in a pan over a medium heat and saute the onions, ginger and garlic for about 8 minutes, or until the onion softens. 2 Add the rinsed and drained mung beans, coconut milk and bone broth/water, then bring to a medium simmer for 40-60 minutes, or until the mung beans are tender – add a further cup of water/bone broth if needed, to get your desired consistency. 3 Add the tamari and pepper, to taste. 4 Towards the end of cooking, chop the greens, add to the pan and simmer until tender – if you’re only making enough for yourself, add the greens to the pan and cook fresh every time you reheat a bowl of mungo.",profile/mina-holland,Mina,Holland

At 6am I go for a 30-minute jog. I love the quiet and sense of a new beginning, a new day. I have breakfast with my girls who will have just tumbled out of bed, and once I’ve dropped off the youngest at school, I ride into Soho, on my pride and joy – my “baby Harley” – or, in everyday speak, my “cruiser” motorbike.  Depending on the day, I’ll either be straight into counselling homeless patients, facilitating a staff team support session, or chairing a meeting. I love the diverse nature of my role because I feel that it deepens and refreshes my clinical practice and rejuvenates me through the range of challenges and opportunities it offers. On clinical days, lunch can be quite a challenge, and it will be a rushed affair at my desk or in the staff room. Sometimes I have the luxury of munching a sandwich in Soho Square, enjoying people watching.  My first career was in organisational psychology, but after several projects I began craving a new direction. I retrained as a psychotherapist and have never looked back. Being entrusted with the lived experience of suffering, feeling able to have a role in its alleviation, and witnessing tangible progress is a unique experience. Before this post, I worked as a counsellor with refugees and asylum seekers from all the trouble spots of the world. Hearing so many tales of atrocity, torture and state sanctioned abuse of power, taught me to value what this country has to offer. I would never want to stop doing clinical work, but I think I’d enjoy investing some of my experience into training and educating new generations of health workers in homeless and inclusion health which is an emerging field. In a complex system where services are commissioned for target groups and in the face of frequent and sometimes uncomfortable structural change, I try to remain focused on the individual and their needs. This is a philosophy that extends outside of my professional life and into my personal and family life. Four and a half years ago I was diagnosed with cancer and experienced the best of what the NHS can offer, both as a patient and employee. I had two major operations at UCH, from which I made a total recovery, and as part of that recovery Central London Community Healthcare (CLCH) let me work from home, during which time I wrote and had a paper published. My afternoons can vary, but today for example, I have co-facilitated an anger support and discussion group drop in session for homeless people. It is a great privilege to witness anger and defiance slowly being replaced with expressions of need and vulnerability, as well as much greater reflection and self-reflection. I’ve also supervised a younger colleague, and made some phone calls regarding a conference I am helping organise around homelessness. Before leaving work I write up my patient notes and input them into the database. Evenings are for catching up with the family and putting my youngest daughter to bed reading her stories or helping her practice for her spelling test. At weekends we will go to a film, or I will drive the girls to their music lessons, or one of many birthday parties. Socialising with long standing friends over good food and Bordeaux wine is always a great treat. The last thing I think about before I go to sleep is how grateful I am for what I have and what I do.

After completing one term, I’m moving to a job at another school that has better facilities and where I will be teaching ceramics, which is a passion of mine. I left on good terms and encouraged a fellow student from my course to apply for my former position, which he did successfully. However, I recently discovered that he is being paid nearly £1,800 more than I was, for the same job, without asking for this in his interview. He is eight years older than I am but has no former experience in an education setting. He previously worked as a restaurant manager. I too worked in the bar and restaurant industry for 10 years – but also previously worked in a secondary school for five years and art gallery for three. His teacher training year was less successful than mine, with lower final grades, so it’s nothing to do with that. I cannot understand why he is on inflated starting pay. Obviously I have left the school now but I feel consumed with anger and want answers – as I can only assume this has happened because he is a man. I don’t want to ruffle feathers, though, or make things difficult for him, and want to stay on good terms as the school networks are tight. Who should I contact about it – or should I just let it go?

According to the band’s guitarist Lindsey Buckingham, the group will cease to operate in 2015 or soon afterwards. He told the American TV channel PBS that the forthcoming Fleetwood Mac album and tour would be their “last act”.  2014 was a big year for Fleetwood Mac: the original keyboardist and songwriter Christine McVie rejoined after quitting the band in 1998. They played a series of acclaimed gigs, and next year bring their On With the Show tour to the UK – including a headline slot at the Isle of Wight festival. There is also the promise of the band’s first album since 2003, which will feature a number of new songs that McVie and Buckingham have worked on together. “She gave me a bunch of stuff to take home,” said Buckingham. “I worked on it, came back, and she loved it. We went into the studio and came out with the best songs we’ve co-written in years.” He added: “Christine really fills the gap of the polarity that might exist otherwise, and helps things breathe.” However, Buckingham did admit to being sceptical when he first heard that McVie wanted to return. He said: “My initial reaction was, ‘OK – we have to take this with baby steps.’ The want to return doesn’t mean you can repeat history; it doesn’t mean all the tools, all the reference points are still there for it all to work.” The current Fleetwood Mac lineup is the same one that oversaw the band’s most successful period, including the trio of classic 1970s albums Fleetwood Mac, Rumours and Tusk, as well as the poppy 1980s hit Tango in the Night. Buckingham concluded: “We’re going to continue working on the new album, and the solo stuff will take a back seat for a year or two. A beautiful way to wrap up this last act.”",profile/timjonze,Tim,Jonze

As the police in America continue to wage war on people of color with impunity, we would be wise to follow the example of grassroots activists - largely women of color - who are questioning the efficacy and safety of relying solely on the criminal justice system on typically feminist issues like domestic and sexual violence. As Mariame Kaba of the Chicago Taskforce on Violence Against Girls and Young Women told me in September: “I want people to ask themselves if they think the way to end domestic violence is to rely on violent institutions”. To ensure that all women have access to the kind of help they want and need – be it from domestic or state violence – we should prop up community solutions like restorative justice and online campaigns like #BlackLivesMatter to center the needs of the most marginalized. The intersection of gun and intimate partner violence also needs to be at the forefront of feminists’ minds in 2015. Last month, a Philadelphia cop Stephen Rozniakowski was arrested for killing his ex-girlfriend, Valerie Morrow, who had a protective order against him. Jason Down of Oregon had protective orders filed against him by three different women – including his ex-girlfriend Cassie Wagner. After Wagner ended her abusive relationship with Down, she was shot and killed in her home. Wagner has been charged with her murder. Most women who are murdered by their partners or exes are killed using guns. The rate of these killings is so high that, according the Violence Policy Center, women are more like to be killed using a gun than “all other means combined”. It’s not enough that men convicted of domestic violence aren’t allowed to have guns. Those who have restraining or protective orders against them should also have to surrender their weapons and be banned from buying guns. It’s additionally time to take the attention and momentum for change around the issue of campus sexual assault and create a national standard for teaching young people, at the middle and high school level, about sexual violence, affirmative consent, and bystander intervention. Feminists, and young activists in particular, have done amazing work to hold universities accountable to their students and existing statute through lawsuits and Title IX mandates. But by the time students get to campus, if they attend at all, it’s often too late to change their deeply embedded notions about gender roles, sex and power. Sexual violence doesn’t begin at the campus gates, so it makes no sense that prevention and education so often starts there. But violence and harassment against women isn’t just a problem in “real life.” We must hold companies like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook accountable for the abuse and harassment that happens on their platforms. GamerGate and a US supreme court case addressing online hate speech put to bed any questions about the ubiquity and awfulness of online harassment. Until social media platforms are forced to take hate speech seriously, we’ll be stuck with a point-and-click band-aid instead of real change. A start? Let’s see these companies put serious dollars behind tech solutions, and work with harassment experts on the best way to implement them. These issues are hardly the only ones that require more focused action. Campus rape, domestic violence, street harassment, abortion restrictions, unequal pay and access to childcare are as important as they were last year, and, with Hillary Clinton probably running for President again, sexism in politics will likely rear its ugly head just as it did in 2008. If you tweeted about feminism last year, this year consider sending an email to your elected representative in support of a policy about which you care. If you signed an online petition, think about searching the Internet for a local organization that needs volunteers. There’s plenty of work to be done to create a more just world for our sons and daughters – and, with just a little more energy, it doesn’t have to be a pipe dream.

The 15-minute New Year’s Eve Fireworks programme had an average of 12.3 million viewers (63%) from 11.55pm, down from 13.7 million viewers (67.5%) for the same broadcast in 2013. It will still be one of the most watched shows of the year across all channels, its overnight audience neck-and-neck with the final of the Great British Bake Off on BBC1 in October, which was also watched by 12.3 million viewers. The Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood show later grew its consolidated audience to 13.5 million, including people who watched it in the subsequent seven days after broadcast.

But procrastinating doesn't make it easier,commentisfree,Opinion,The Guardian,"In many parts of the world, January is cold – and it’s not just the weather. The start of a new year seems to encourage people to find themselves anew ... and single. Facebook data suggests that a spike in break-ups starts two weeks prior to Christmas. In January, divorce filings go up 10%, and divorce inquiries spike 25%. People seem to make it to the end of the holiday season and then decide Hey, this isn’t working – or, perhaps worse, that it hasn’t been working for long enough to finally do something about it. But why does this happen? Why do we consistently wait until arguably the worst time of year to decide to break-up? Perhaps we are all a bunch of procrastinators who wait until some proverbial deadline – the end of the year – to finally make a change.  For decades, Dr Joseph Ferrari, a professor of psychology at DePaul University in Chicago, Illinois and the author of Still Procrastinating: The No Regrets Guide to Getting It Done, has been studying people’s procrastination habits. He says that procrastination is more prevalent in people than substance abuse or depression.  “Everybody procrastinates, but not everyone is a procrastinator,” he told me recently. Over the years, Ferrari has found that everyone engages in some level of procrastination – and a shocking 20 to 25% of Americans are deemed “chronic procrastinators” who put off everything. He believes that procrastination is so rampant is not because procrastinators are lazy – he actually believes they’re quite clever and smart because they are able to invent new reasons to not do something so often – but rather because they have a fear of failure. Procrastination, he told me, communicates to those around us that we could accomplish whatever task at-hand (like end a relationship ... or make one work), but we have other reasons for not doing so beyond a lack of ability. To show that we lack the ability to do something difficult would have a negative impact on what Ferrari calls our “social esteem”, and thus we’d run the risk of looking like failures to those around us. He said, “One of the things I have been able to show is that [procrastination] is heavily related to social esteem protection”, or the concern with the ways the other people view us. “Procrastinators are very concerned with what other people think about them.”  So it makes sense that someone might barrel through the holidays in a relationship they want out of: their social esteem is at risk.  Going home – especially if you don’t go home often – can be quite stressful because your family will be asking lots of questions about your life, including, most frighteningly How are things going in your love life?. If you’re already in a relationship, the pressure to stay in a relationship until after the holidays is real. So you wait – you procrastinate. Beyond personal procrastination, there’s something about the start of a new year that often triggers people to make changes – most commonly in the form of resolutions, which we peg to the start of new year even when we could simply change our actions at any time. This form of premeditated waiting-to-change is tied to what Dr Tim Pychyl, a professor of psychology at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, calls “cultural procrastination”. “The reason why I call it cultural procrastination is that you and I may start thinking about our New Year’s resolutions in the fall,” he told me. “You know, I am going to start exercising more, but I am going to wait until January. There is some absurdity in that.” You don’t wake up on 1 January and think, Oh, I am going to lose some weight. Like a break-up, you think about it for some time in advance and just use the beginning of a new year as the point where you actually do anything about it. But relationships – or their end – are not just New Year’s resolutions: there is another person, with feelings, in a relationship. And while waiting until after the ball drops to end to a commitment you’ve been wanting out of for a while might feel like the right thing to do, the other person in your relationship might not see it that way, and it’s his or her broken heart that matters more than whether you have to tell your mother you’re single or whether a new year seems like a “good time” to end things.

238,2015-01-02T13:00:12Z,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jan/02/minimum-wage-healthcare-small-businesses-2015,Minimum wage and healthcare to pose challenges to small businesses in 2015,money,Money,The Guardian,"Recently, small business owners took to the streets to protest government policies in France. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls then announced reforms to boost the economy. They include increasing the number of businesses operating on Sundays and opening up regulated sectors to competition. The result: thousands of opponents demonstrated in Paris, saying the measures go against the political beliefs of the country’s left-wing government.  Small business owners in the United States haven’t taken to the streets but they do have issues going into 2015 – including, most importantly, the possibility of lower taxes.  “Tax reform has been talked about. President Obama has signaled some support for tax relief for corporations and small businesses, and there seems to be bipartisan interest”, said Amanda Austin, vice president of public policy for the National Federation of Independent Business.   That’s because most US businesses are organized as sole proprietors, so they pay individual income taxes rather than the corporate tax.  Janemarie Mulvey, a former chief economist for the Small Business Administration’s Office of Advocacy, oversaw a study on the various tax provisions that impact small businesses. She says small businesses have been forgotten in the massive congressional battles over tax rates for big corporations.  “While a lot of the debate about differential tax rates for businesses internationally has referred to the US corporate tax rate, which is higher in the US compared to other countries generally, small businesses are taxed at the individual level and thus individual tax provisions impacting their business are more important,” Mulvaney says.     Healthcare coverage is one of the biggest costs facing small business owners in 2015. Universal healthcare just isn’t on the table, say experts. Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images   Healthcare: to cover or not to cover?  The key priority: the distinction between whether workers are on the job 30 hours or 40 hours, which makes a big difference in benefits coverage.  The 30-hour definition for the employer-shared responsibility provision has led to two problems. Most employers that provide coverage to their full-time employees working 40 or more hours a week are less likely to provide coverage to employees working 30 to 39 hours, thus increasing potential penalties.  Making the definition of full-time consistent at 40 hours per week would save small businesses approximately $38.6bn in penalties over 10 years, according to estimates by the Congressional Budget Office.  And measuring who is full-time using the 30-hour definition and who is not for purposes of the penalty has led to a confusing and convoluted look-back measurement process for employers.  As for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Elliot Richardson, the CEO of Chicago-based Small Business Advocacy Council, said:  There has been much noise regarding whether or not the ACA is good for small businesses. Health insurance rates have gone up dramatically in Illinois in the past 10 years due to a lack of competition it relates to options. We hope that by bringing a health insurance co-op option, there will be a player in the game that will help to stabilize health instance. People will argue that there should be universal health coverage but that isn’t on the table. Blue Cross/Blue Shield has been the dominant player in Chicago. If you believe in the free market, you can’t have that if one company is writing all of the policies, and Blue Cross wrote about 90% of the policies last year. The co-op has rates that are competitive in the year since it was formed. A small business can’t compete in the marketplace with a large business when they can’t afford to give quality healthcare.  “The state of Illinois is flagrantly anti-small business, even though 56% of its residents either own, or work for, a small business,” said Steve Banke, CEO of 3Points LLC, a computer network consulting firm and chairman of the Small Business Advocacy Council’s healthcare committee. Banke is exercised about Illinois’ approach:   Illinois has the largest number of taxing bodies in the nation (almost 7,000), making it one of the largest bureaucratic institutions in the history of mankind. This labyrinth of government entities, and their associated tax laws and regulations, make it impossible for any small business to effectively comply. This means that opening a business in Illinois is a super-high-risk proposition just because of the regulatory environment in the state. To add insult to injury, Illinois charges the highest fees in the nation to open and maintain a small business.   Mulvey recommends excluding firms with 50 to 99 employees from the ACA’s employer shared-responsibility penalties and scrapping the law’s multiple, conflicting definitions of full-time employees in favor of a single, uniform standard.  “While the ACA provides tax breaks and new insurance marketplaces that could potentially benefit small businesses, there also are increased administrative burdens – including new Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reporting requirements and insurance coverage mandates, coupled with potential employer penalties for some companies that fail to offer adequate or affordable health insurance coverage.”  With Republicans taking control of both chambers of Congress in January but short of enough votes to overturn a presidential veto, the ACA won’t likely be repealed. But legislative changes to the law are a virtual certainty.  “Implementation of key parts of the law over the next two years presents crucial challenges for small businesses, and the complexity of the law’s regulations may well have the effect of increasing the administrative burden to small businesses,” said Dr Mulvey.  To alleviate those burdens, she would exclude firms with 50 to 99 full-time employees from the employer shared-responsibility penalty. These firms face a catch-22: they are penalized if they fail to provide “adequate and affordable coverage” – yet the insurance requirements for them are more stringent in terms of coverage mandates and premium restrictions than for their larger counterparts.  “In addition, firms subject to the employer shared-responsibility penalty must also report to the IRS the details of their insurance coverage for each and every full-time worker,” said Mulvey. “Classifying these firms properly as small businesses rather than as ‘applicable large employers’ would not only eliminate their exposure to potential penalties, but would significantly reduce their administrative burdens with respect to IRS reporting requirements.”    Minimum wage jobs, like those on farms where these cows are being milked, are going to be a concern for small business owners in 2015. Photograph: Amir Cohen/Reuters   Minimum wage  Minimum wage is also a concern.  “Employers are concerned about a federal minimum wage threshold,” said Austin of the NFIB. “The federal minimum wage dictates where the states are going to be and the states have the right to increase theirs. Employers would be concerned about any significant increase in the federal minimum wage.”  And Chicago (as well as Seattle) just enacted a higher minimum wage law.  “Our organization doesn’t have an official position on the minimum wage, but there are folks who are troubled by the fact that the Chicago minimum wage differs from the state minimum,” said Richardson.  On a positive note, the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index climbed from 96.1 in October to 98.1 in November. It’s the highest level of recorded optimism since the start of 2007. Expectations for business conditions six months out rose 16%, while expectations for real sales volumes rose 5%.  Small business owners in the US are more optimistic now than at any time since early 2008, according to the latest Wells Fargo/Gallup Small Business Index. The overall score rose to 58 in November, up from 49 in July. The index was last this high in the first quarter of 2008, when it was at 83. Despite the challenges, it seems that optimism is very firmly back in place. ",profile/steve-viuker,viuker,steve
239,2015-01-02T13:02:35Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jan/02/fernando-torres-return-atletico-madrid,Fernando Torres: strange journey from storm-force striker to bargaining chip,football,Football,The Guardian,"It sounds like a fairytale: the return of Fernando Torres to Atlético Madrid, where he built a reputation as one of the world’s most prolific and admired young strikers. Instead the fear must be that it will merely represent the continuation of a long nightmare for the former golden boy of the Estadio Vicente Calderón. Who would have thought, when Torres scored the only goal in the final of Euro 2008, at the end of a season in which he had accumulated 24 goals for Liverpool, that it would come to this: a journey home in search of sanctuary following rejection by leading clubs in England and Italy, with one club ready to write off a huge transfer fee and the other prepared to pay him, in effect, almost €2m a year not to play for them. Just before the new year Milan, for whom he had scored just once in 13 appearances on loan since the start of the season, announced that they had secured his formal transfer from Chelsea, with no fee involved. This curious deal allowed Milan to initiate an immediate loan swap with Atlético, bringing the winger Alessio Cerci back to Italy. What seems to be happening is that Milan will continue to pay Torres €4m a year until his contract expires in 18 months’ time, while Atlético will pay €2.2m a year to a man who started only one La Liga match for them in four months. It says everything about the state of Torres’s career that Milan, desperate for a star to fill the shirt once worn by Marco van Basten, George Weah and Andriy Shevchenko, could find use for him only as a bargaining chip. The wobbles set in for Torres several months before his £50m transfer to Chelsea in January 2011, which set a new record for English football (and remains the most expensive transaction between two Premier League clubs). At the time it was believed that he had reacted badly to the departure from Anfield of Xabi Alonso and Javier Mascherano and to the sacking of Rafa Benítez at a time when the ownership of the club was in turmoil. There was speculation, too, about the effect of a knee operation in April 2010. But the two goals he scored to beat Chelsea at Anfield that November were apparently enough to convince Roman Abramovich of the continuing value of a player he had long coveted. A few months earlier, at the World Cup in South Africa, Torres should have been at his peak as part of the smooth-running machine that carried Spain to the second of their unprecedented three major international championships in a row. He started four of the first five matches but was left on the bench for the semi-final and final, failing to mark the tournament with a goal. At Euro 2012, rendered obsolete by the “false nine” theory, he was brought in to start the second group match against the Republic of Ireland and scored twice. But he was back on the bench for the last three rounds, although he came on late in the final, against Italy’s 10 men, to score the third of Spain’s four unanswered goals. Last year in Brazil, as his country’s reign disintegrated, he started only the third group match, against Australia, scoring the second of three goals for a team already eliminated. What had happened to the fresh-faced killer who scored his goals with a deft flick of the head or a fuss-free swish of the boot? As time went on, and his failure to score for Chelsea became a standing joke, it seemed clear that this was not just the sort of bad trot all strikers experience at some time or other. This was a collapse of confidence so profound that any sort of recovery seemed unlikely. His nerve-riddled Chelsea debut was the start of a run of 14 barren appearances before he finally scored – amid an appropriately apocalyptic thunderstorm – after being brought off the bench against West Ham. It was reminiscent of the humiliation of Chris Sutton, who arrived at Stamford Bridge from Blackburn for £10m – a club record – in 1999 but immediately bottled a couple of one-on-ones and scored just once in 29 league appearances before being packed off to Celtic at a £4m loss a year later. But like Patrick Kluivert, who endured one catastrophic season with Milan as a 21-year-old before rebuilding his career at Barcelona, or Gervinho, a joke among Arsenal’s supporters before redeeming himself with Roma, Sutton succeeded in proving at Parkhead that even the most abject failure in one environment is not necessarily the end. Sometimes, of course, footballers suffer a trauma from which there is no recovery. “You’ll never beat Des Walker” was the Nottingham Forest fans’ chant until Marc Overmars destroyed the defender at Wembley in 1993, and Walker was never quite the same immaculate performer again. Five years later Overmars applied the same treatment to Manchester United’s 19-year-old defender John Curtis, the Phil Jones of his day, effectively extinguishing the top-flight career of a player who had been tipped as a future England captain. Strikers are particularly vulnerable. Ted MacDougall, signed by Frank O’Farrell in 1972 on the strength of 103 goals in 146 league games for Bournemouth, left Old Trafford within months. Justin Fashanu took Match of the Day’s goal of the season award in 1980 with an effort that would have made James Rodríguez proud, but crumbled after Brian Clough paid £1m for him the following year. Luther Blissett at Milan in 1983, Mark Hughes at Barcelona in 1986, Ian Rush at Juventus in 1987, and Darko Pancev at Internazionale (where he arrived in 1992 as the winner of the Ballon d’Or with Red Star) all failed to meet high expectations. Torres will be presented to Atlético’s fans at a special ceremony on Sunday. By returning to the club that was his home between the ages of 11 and 23, and by reuniting himself with two men – the present manager, Diego Simeone, and his assistant, Germán Burgos – who were once his team-mates in the red and white stripes, the 30-year-old is giving himself one last shot at redemption. There have already been YouTube clips of him getting his feet in a tangle and missing open goals in training this week. Over the next fortnight Atlético play Real Madrid at home and away in the Copa del Rey, sandwiching a visit to the Camp Nou for a league match. Only the hardest of hearts will not be wishing him good luck with that.",profile/richardwilliams,williams,

It is thought that 20% of the brain consists of naturally fatty acids such as omega-3 and omega-6, for instance. Blood sugar levels and caffeine intake have long since been known to affect mood, while low levels of B vitamins have been found to exacerbate the symptoms of schizophrenia.  Recent studies have focused on how exercise and a healthy diet can improve the prognosis for serious mental health conditions such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. CoolTan Arts - one of nine mental health charities part of this year’s Guardian and Observer appeal - believe there is a strong connection between food and mental health. Two years ago they started a cooking club for their members; many have experience of mental illness. Based in Southwark, south London, members meet twice a week to choose and cook recipes together. The club adapts its recipes to cater to the needs of those who attend or for those on medication that can bring side effects such as weight gain or appetite loss. There is a strong link between mental health conditions (in particular, depression) and diabetes, which is taken into consideration, as is the need to be sensitive around those with eating disorders.  The club is one of the reasons why celebrity chef Rosemary Shrager is a patron of CoolTan Arts. Especially for the appeal, she has given us the recipe for her own winter warming soup.  It is packed with tomatoes, which contain the antioxidants lycopene and vitamins A and C and have long been linked with anti-depressive properties.  Rosemary said:   I strongly believe there’s a link between good food and good mental health and I am so glad this important project is supported by the Guardian Christmas charity appeal. It is wonderful that people have a chance to expand and strengthen themselves, their dreams and their identities, through this vital access to creativity and community.   Rosemary Shrager’s winter warming soup with tomato and fennel    Rosemary Shrager’s winter warming soup is a recipe shared by the celebrity chef for the Guardian and Observer Christmas appeal on mental health Photograph: CoolTan Arts   (serves 4) 2 tbsp olive oil 2 bulbs fennel 450g fresh ripe tomatoes 2 cloves of garlic 275 ml v8 juice or tomato juice Grated rind of ½ a lemon Salt and pepper ½ tsp white sugar 275ml stock A 400g tin of butterbeans, drained and rinsed Method Wash and chop the fennel, reserving the fronds. Heat the oil in a thick pan, add the fennel and cook over a gentle heat for 10 minutes until soft but not browned, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, peel the tomatoes, plunging them first for 1 minute in boiling water (this helps to loosen the skins). Roughly chop them. Crush the garlic into the fennel, stir round and cook for 1 minute, then add the tomatoes, v8 juice, lemon rind, salt, pepper, sugar and stock. Bring to the boil and simmer for 5 minutes. Take off the heat and liquidise or process the soup. Return the soup to a clean pan and stir the butter beans through. Chop and the reserved fennel fronds. Bring to boiling point, test for seasoning and add a little more stock if it is too thick for your taste (this will depend a lot on how watery your tomatoes are). When it’s fully heated through, put the soup in a thermos flask which has been previously heated with boiling water. “Now I see food as more than something to console myself” CoolTan Arts say the benefits of the cooking club are more than practical education. “For a lot of people who come to our cooking club, it’s the only time they eat with another person. For that alone, it’s important,” Jill Newman, the club’s coordinator, tells me.    Coordinator Jill Newman and Michelle Baharier, CoolTan Arts’ CEO with the charity’s cooking club Photograph: Emma Thatcher/CoolTan Arts   In the long term, it’s about change. Jill goes along with members of the club to visit local market holders, to increase confidence in buying fresh fruit and vegetables, and to teach about budgeting – important when people are struggling to survive on low incomes or benefit payments. For many people living in hostels or shared housing, cooking apparatus might not exist at home. A survey of 48 people at CoolTan Arts found that just 18 had a working cooker at home. Some at the cooking club have only a single-hob or a microwave; others have neither.  Alice Babapunde, 35, has been going to CoolTan’s cooking club every week for six months. She was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder four years ago and had just finished a six month treatment programme when she joined.  The cooking club is a lovely way to cook and eat together - I never did that with my family. It has changed my habits too. Now I go to the market rather than just Tesco all the time and I am more in touch with healthy food, instead of just seeing it as something to console myself.  Michelle Baharier, CEO of CoolTan Arts, told me that their funding from Southwark Council ran out at the end of March. At the moment, the club keeps going by selling £2 lunches to other attendees at CoolTan.  Yet Baharier says there is clearly a demand:  It’s devastating, because we work with over 2,000 people and the kitchen is so important. Eating is such an important part of people staying well.  The club have created many of their own recipes. Here is one you might want to try for that winter cold: Cold-busting sorrel and hibiscus punch    Sorrel and hibiscus punch is a recipe from the cooking club at CoolTan Arts, a mental health charity based in south London. Photograph: Emma Thatcher/CoolTan Arts    Vitamin deficiencies have been shown to exacerbate the symptoms of psychiatric patients and impede recovery. Pomegranate contains folic acid and Vitamin C, which plays a core role in the brain as an antioxidant while recent studies suggest that hibiscus can reduce blood pressure for adults experiencing - or at risk of - hypertension.

Juice the oranges and lemons. Peel, core and roughly chop the apples. Put the pomegranate seeds, mint leaves, ginger root, tamarind, apples and squeezed juice into a liquidiser and blend well. Strain the liquid from the hibiscus flowers into the mix and add the spices and the syrup or honey Blend all together and pour through a sieve into a litre jug.

In the other, a plane carrying 29 passengers on board landed safely following an engine fire, which led to it being diverted from London City airport to Southend airport in Essex. The fire was extinguished before landing by automatic systems on the twin propeller plane, although emergency services said it had the potential to be an extremely serious incident. The plane, which was also carrying three crew members and belonged to Blue Island Airways, landed just before 9am at Southend after being diverted. Neil Fenwick, divisional officer at Essex county fire and rescue service, said: “This was a textbook operation. The fire was out by the time the plane touched down and no one appears to have been hurt. “The plane landed safely on one engine and automatic fire suppression systems on board had completely extinguished the fire. “Our crews made sure that the fire was fully out but were not required to take any further action. This had the potential to be an extremely serious incident but everything which should happen in a situation like this did and the plane was able to land safely.” Passengers were transported to the terminal and were due to be taken by coach back to City airport. The incident at Stornoway airport on Lewis occurred at 8.33am and involved a Saab 340 aircraft operated by Loganair. A passenger who was on board told the BBC that it felt as if the aircraft’s tail was caught by a crosswind. Two male passengers were taken to Stornoway hospital for treatment to injuries while two female passengers who received minor injuries declined medical assistance. The remaining 22 passengers and three members of crew were unhurt. An investigation has been launched by aviation authorities in conjunction with Police Scotland. Normal operations were due to resume once the plane was removed from the runway. Stornoway airport said in a statement: “Efforts to remove the aircraft from the runway are ongoing and investigations into the cause of the incident are under way.”",profile/benquinn,Ben ,Quinn

So, logically, it follows that there is no reason for their retrial. Peter Greste, Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed did not spread false news and did not support the Muslim Brotherhood. Their problem stemmed from working for a broadcaster based in Qatar, a country which is viewed - and not only by Egypt - as having given comfort to Islamist subversives.  In Greste’s native Australia, its foreign minister, Julie Bishop, has spoken of there being “a cause for optimism” for the trio. She is aware that, aside from a retrial, Greste and Fahmy, who has dual Egyptian-Canadian citizenship, have another route out of jail by having requested deportation under “some kind of prisoner transfer agreement”. That would not help Baher Mohamed, however. Nor would it clear the names of the three journalists (and their employer), which would surely be the best outcome of all. Meanwhile, we get another glimpse of Egyptian justice today in  a lengthy article in the Irish Times  about one of the trio’s cellmates, Ibrahim Halawa, a young man born in Ireland of Egyptian parents who went to Cairo for a family holiday in June 2013. He was arrested with his three sisters - Somaia, Fatima and Omaima - while sheltering in a mosque during street clashes in August 2013. The sisters were freed after three months and returned to Ireland.  But Halawa, who was then 17, was accused of shooting at police and charged with murder, attempted murder and destruction of public property. He has been in jail, without trial, ever since. Amnesty International conducted what its Irish executive director, Colm O’Gorman, described as a “thorough examination of the case” and found that “Ibrahim was not at the location of the alleged shooting”. It has recognised Halawa, who celebrated his 19th birthday last month, as a “prisoner of conscience”.  Reprieve, a UK-based charity, has also taken up Halawa’s case and called for his release. His father, Sheikh Hussein Halawa, is Ireland’s most senior Muslim cleric and imam of an Islamic cultural centre in Dublin. According to WikiLeaks correspondence released in 2011, US officials believe he was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood (which is now a banned organisation in Egypt). However, he has spoken out publicly and often against Islamist extremism.",profile/roygreenslade,Roy,Greenslade

An “immersive theatre” experience, it reminded me, not for the first time, of the gulf between traditional fairytales and the more anodyne, modern stories for the young. In some of these old tales, children have their heads hacked off and adults are stuck in barrels full of nails and rolled in to rivers to drown. Like the ancient stories of Greek gods, random violence and cruelty were part of the paradigm. My children lapped it up. Interestingly, they were the only children there. It appears to be mostly adults who are attracted to the traditional narratives these stories showcase. These are stories at their most basic, with little in the way of character development or dialogue. Plot – and the meaning that lies within it – is everything. Modern adult storytellers – at least in the literary world – sometimes look down on plot as the poor relation of style, but the audience profile at Grimm Tales speaks of the enduring appeal of powerful tales simply told. But why do these particular plots have such resonance for the audience? Bruno Bettelheim in his study, The Uses of Enchantment, suggested that folk and fairytales that endure from generation to generation, speak to something deep in the reader’s unconscious – for instance, that these older tales legitimised the murderous and violent instincts that all children experience, freeing them from the guilt that such feelings generate. This is – not something that We’re Going on A Bear Hunt is likely to achieve. I attempted to write a young adult fairytale with Fearless, which I set out to construct in a purely mythological fashion. Inspired by these old, dark tales I piled on the heartache, not an easy sell for a children’s story (the heroine, a little girl, is eventually imprisoned and comes to a terrible end). It wasn’t much of a commercial hit, but I was amazed at the amount of heartfelt responses from young readers, whose taste for tragedy, it turned out, was at least equal to their need for the more conventional, optimistic “heartening” narratives. Whether or not you believe in Bettelheim’s Freudian take on storytelling, it is unquestionable that the best stories have a profound resonance within our subconscious minds. Some of the Grimm tales transparently address our darkest fears, but in a sense, all mythic storytelling is about addressing uncertainties and anxieties. Joseph Campbell’s The Hero With A Thousand Faces (the book George Lucas used to create the template for Star Wars) shows us how all great adventure stories are guides to help us through changes in our life from one place of development to another. Many fairy stories very obviously address the arrival of sexuality – princesses are invariably virgins until the prince turns up and slays the monster (of guilt?). The fear of being abandoned by one’s parents (Hansel and Gretel), or of being destroyed by (or destroying) a parent or sibling – always disguised as, say, a “wicked stepsister” or “stepmother” – recurs again and again, allowing children to access their darker fantasies. Archetypal stories, then, for adults and children – even the “simplest”, not usually thought of as “art” – are more than merely entertainment. The more they involve us imaginatively, the more they speak to the secret self. Without access to those ancient portals that lie within us all, and certainly lie within Grimm Tales, we may applaud the style, and the elegance and the sophistication of the storyteller. And in children’s stories, we may be drawn to a blandly heartwarming tale. But if that primitive resonance is not achieved, storytellers are failing to fulfil what is perhaps their primary function, which is therapeutic – to act as an echo chamber to our deepest fears and desires, and thus help to integrate them into a healthy personality. • Follow Tim on Twitter @timlottwriter",profile/tim-lott,,Lott

Mark Schultz mounted an angry social media assault on Miller after critics reviewing the film suggested there may have been homosexual undertones to the relationship between the on-screen Schultz, played by Channing Tatum, and multi-millionaire wrestling impresario John DuPont, played by Steve Carell. Schultz, who had previously appeared supportive of the film, reportedly wrote on Facebook and Twitter: “The personalities and relationships between the characters in the film are primarily fiction and somewhat insulting. Leaving the audience with a feeling that somehow there could have been a sexual relationship between DuPont and I is a sickening and insulting lie.”    Sparring partners ... Channing Tatum and Steve Carell in Foxcatcher Photograph: AP   He added: “I told Bennett Miller to cut that scene out and he said it was to give the audience the feeling that duPont was encroaching on your privacy and personal space. I wasn’t explicit so I didn’t have a problem with it. Then after reading 3 or 4 reviews interpreting it sexually, and jeopardising my legacy, they need to have a press conference to clear the air, or I will.” Foxcatcher tells the story of the eccentric DuPont’s decade-long sponsorship of a wrestling camp at his palatial Pennsylvania estate and the tragic death of Schultz’s elder brother Dave, a fellow US gold medal-winner portrayed in the film by Mark Ruffalo, at the hands of his benefactor. As well as prior support from Mark Schultz, who at one point changed his Facebook profile picture to one of himself and Miller, the film’s ​accuracy was confirmed by Dave Schultz’s widow Nancy in an interview with the Observer in December.  Mark Schultz later deleted several social media posts, in which he also referred to Miller as a “punk”, “pussy” and “liar”, but clarified his position in a further Facebook post (since deleted) on New Year’s Day. He wrote: “My story and my life are real. I am a real human being. While I may have tweeted out of anger, I in no way regret standing up for myself, nor do I regret calling out the only other man who has had decision-making power concerning my image and legacy these past years. “I apologise for the harshness of my language, but I am firm in where I stand. I will gladly go to any lengths to protect and safeguard the integrity and truth of my story, my life, my character and my legacy. If that’s not worth fighting over while I’m still alive, I don’t know what is.”    Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo in Foxcatcher Photograph: Allstar/SONY PICTURES CLASSICS   Mark Schultz’s belated attack on Foxcatcher and Miller, the acclaimed US director of Moneyball and Capote, is just the latest public dispute over factual accuracy to hit an Oscar-tipped movie as the 2015 awards season hits full swing. Earlier this week, Selma director Ava DuVernay was forced to speak out after an aide to Lyndon B Johnson questioned the former US president’s portrayal in the Golden Globe-nominated civil rights drama.  Meanwhile Tim Burton’s art exposé Big Eyes has been attacked by the daughter of its subject, Walter Keane, who the film suggests falsely claimed responsibility for painting the famous “big eyed waif” portraits of the 1950s. Finally, US journalist Christian Caryl lambasted second world war codebreaker drama The Imitation Game in the New York Review of Books for depicting Britain’s Alan Turing, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, as a “dour Mr Spock who is disliked by all of his co-workers” and “just the sort of mythological gay man, whiney and weak, that homophobes love to hate” in contradiction of what the critic said were historical facts.",profile/benchild,child,ben

The Sierra Leone-flagged Ezadeen was the second vessel in four days to be abandoned by its crew in rough seas, forcing the Italian authorities to intervene to prevent a disaster, and possibly the loss of many lives. In a statement, the Italian coastguard said three of its officers had taken control of the ship after landing a helicopter on it.    A photograph taken by the Icelandic coastguard of the Ezadeen. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images   The Ezadeen had been drifting without power about 40 nautical miles off the coast with as many as 450 people on board. “We know that it left from a Turkish port and was abandoned by its crew,” coastguard spokesman Filippo Marini told SkyTG24 television. “When we hailed the ship to ask about its status, a migrant woman responded, saying, ‘We are alone and we have no one to help us.’” It had been put on a collision course for the Italian coast but ran out of fuel, he said. A similar tactic was used by the crew of a ship which, on Tuesday, put out a distress call as it passed the Greek island of Corfu on its way into the Adriatic Sea. Almost 800 migrants, mostly Syrian refugees, landed in Italy the following day after the Italian rescue services took command of the vessel. The Moldovan-registered Blue Sky M was within five miles and 45 minutes’ sailing time of a disaster when it was boarded and brought under control.    The Blue Sky M cargo ship almost crashed on to rocks off Italy’s south-eastern shore. Photograph: Reuters   On Thursday, Italian police arrested four men they claim were the skipper and crew of the Blue Sky M. Prosecutors investigating the incident believe the Syrian captain and his crew did not leave the ship, as originally believed, but mingled with the migrants after abandoning the vessel to its fate. The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said it was closely following the events surrounding the Ezadeen. “The rescues of the Blue Sky M two days ago and of the Ezadeen show that smugglers are finding new ways to enter EU territory,” a spokesperson told AFP. “To prevent such events and to protect the lives of migrants, fighting smuggling will continue to be a priority under the commission’s agenda for comprehensive migration in 2015,” the spokesperson said. The Ezadeen was secured by rescue teams for towing after several hours of struggling to attach a line, Marini said. Southern Italy is currently in the grip of unusually low temperatures and high winds. An Icelandic ship – part of a new European patrol force to aid migrants at sea – was towing the abandoned cargo vessel towards a port in the southern region of Calabria. The force was intended to fill the gap left by Operation Mare Nostrum, which had a more proactive remit to search for migrants in distress, rather than wait for them to raise the alarm after entering Italian waters. Children and pregnant women were among the migrants – believed to be mostly Syrians – Marini said. More than 170,000 people trying to reach Europe have been plucked from the sea by Italian rescuers in the past 14 months. But hundreds, and possibly thousands, have perished trying to make the crossing.   ",profile/johnhooper,John,Hooper
247,2015-01-02T13:56:04Z,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jan/02/crowdfunded-science-scientists-fund-research,"Crowdfunded science: harnessing the wisdom of the crowd, or selling out?",science,Science,The Guardian,"A hunt for the first moon orbiting a planet outside our solar system, a study into how LSD affects the brain, and an attempt to unravel what the dodo did with its strange beak are among the latest scientific endeavours to appeal for financial help from the crowd online. The projects are part of a growing trend among academic researchers to seek funding for their work outside traditional government and industry-backed sources. Faced with the threat of budget cuts and intense competition for the money that remains, scientists around the world are instead turning directly to the public for the help they need. In the process, they are unlocking millions of pounds via crowdfunding websites, but there are fears that as the funding becomes more significant it will skew the type of research being done or give governments an excuse to pull back from funding science. A particularly eye-catching example was the announcement in November of an attempt to build the first crowdfunded moon lander, which will drill deep into the lunar surface to study the rock beneath. Lunar Mission One said it wants to transform the way space exploration is funded by raising £600,000 to start the project from millions of small payments by the public. In return for higher payments, supporters are promised space on the mission to send a strand of their hair.    Millions of small payments from the public could put Lunar Mission One on the moon.  Illustration: Lunar Missions   Many other scientists are turning to the crowd. Dr David Kipping, a British astronomer now based at Harvard, has raised funds to help his search to find the first exomoon – a moon that orbits a planet in another solar system. His ambitious project involves sifting through huge quantities of data gathered by the Kepler Space Telescope as it stares into space, looking for an almost imperceptible change in brightness from a star that might indicate a planet with a moon passing in front of it. In less than a month he was able to raise $12,000 (£7,700) from public contributions through the crowdfunding site PetriDish, giving his team enough to buy a small supercomputer needed to crunch the numbers. It has allowed them to examine 57 planetary systems beyond our own solar system for signs that one might harbour a moon and has led to a $2m grant from Nasa to extend the search to look around hundreds of exoplanets. Dr Kipping said: “When I first started on the project it was very difficult to get the funding we needed – we had just 64 desktop computers that were nowhere near powerful enough. “Our project really seemed to strike a chord with the public – I think because everyone could understand what an exomoon was and how exciting it could be.” Although many crowdfunding websites are cautious about revealing exactly how much money has been raised for science, money from this source is now estimated to contribute millions of pounds to the research community. SciFund Challenge, for example, has allowed nearly 200 researchers to raise an average of $2,000 (£1,272) for 159 different projects. Hundreds of projects on RocketHub have raised up to half a million dollars each. But there are some who fear that using crowdfunding to support science could alter the balance of what research gets the green light. Certainly, the list of projects vying for money includes some unusual science, such as a US ecologist who has been trying to record the sounds that fish in the Amazon make, and as an enticement offers funders the opportunity to download the sound of a fish farting as a ringtone on their phone.    Some research proposals will have clear public appeal, such as a study to determine how much tranquilliser would have been needed to stop a T rex in its tracks. Photograph: Oli Scarff/Getty Images   Another is a vet at Iowa State University who wants to work out how much tranquilliser would be needed to bring down a Tyrannosaurus rex by studying dinosaur DNA. There are fears that crowdfunding could skew what research gets done. Sarah Main, director of the UK’s Campaign for Science and Engineering, said: “There is a real question about the quality of science that will get funding if there is more of a reliance on crowdfunding. Putting together a proposal that is attractive to the public does not have to be as scientifically robust as putting an application into a panel of experts. “I would be concerned about the effect of having to ensure that proposals have public appeal. A different type of work would attract that kind of funding and many of the important areas, such as in medical research, would be overlooked.” However, there are some who believe crowdfunding will complement the current research structure, allowing studies that are overlooked by traditional funding sources or considered too controversial to receive government money, to blossom.    A US ecologist is recording the sounds that fish in the Amazon make, and offers funders the opportunity to download the sound of a fish farting as a ringtone. Photograph: Alamy   Professor David Nutt, a neuropsychopharmacologist at Imperial College London who was controversially sacked from the UK government’s Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs over his views on the dangers of ecstasy, is to launch a bid to raise funding for research into the effects of LSD on the brain through a British-based crowdfunding site called Walacea. This, according to Dr Didier Schmitt, a scientific adviser to the European commission – which itself is threatening cuts to its science budget – could be the real power of crowdfunding in the future. “In the case of projects competing for public funding, crowdfunding is a measure of citizen interest and could be used to help decision-makers and experts in their final choice,” he said. Brian Meece, founder of RocketHub, argues that crowdfunding is empowering the public to choose: “We don’t judge campaigns based on content, as long as the project is legal and tasteful, it has a shot. “These academic campaigns empower ‘the people’ to fund science – a paradigm shift, since science has been traditionally supported by governments, endowments or other institutions.” Walacea was founded in October 2013 by Natalie Jonk, a 32-year-old former scientific adviser in the pharmaceutical industry, after she saw the difficulty young scientists were having getting funding for their work. “Scientific research really shapes our society and can really improve our lives,” she said. “At the same time, getting funding is really difficult. Only about 10 to 20% of funding applications are successful and it is particularly difficult for scientists early in their career. “There has been a lot of focus on trying to encourage more young people into science, but actually that is not the problem. There are a lot of people who want to do research, it is getting funded that is the issue.” There is still some way to go before crowdfunding can begin to replace the £5bn the British government has set aside in the budget for 2015/2016 for scientific research or the £140bn the US government spent on science last year. Imran Khan, chief executive of the British Science Association, believes that while crowdfunding could lead to scientists dreaming up projects that are likely to capture the public imagination, it could ultimately help science. “If crowdfunding does become an appreciable part of the mix down the road then we might see more scientists deliberately thinking up projects that would have a direct public appeal,” he said. “But equally it might change how the public sees science. Scientists might become better at explaining the value of research that’s happening anyway, and non-scientists might become better at tuning in to it.”    Crowdfunding paid for a supercomputer to search for exomoons in the vast quantities of data from the Kepler space telescope.

The Kepler Space Telescope has now identified 996 exoplanets, with another 4,000 candidates still to be confirmed. Many of these are giant worlds, far bigger than our own and probably too hostile for life. Yet in orbit around some of these planets, there may be Earth-sized moons that could provide a refuge for alien life. There have already been hints that there may be exomoons out there, but none has yet been identified. Dr Kipping and his team have used the money to buy a small supercomputer that allowed them to analyse data from 57 planets by looking for tiny, periodic changes in the brightness of stars that may indicate the presence of the moon.

After the species was wiped out by hungry sailors during the 17th century, the only information about what the dodo ate and what it’s odd-shaped beak was for are a few sketchy accounts in ship records and diaries. Some say the one-metre-tall relatives of pigeons ate large fruit or hard nuts, others say they used their beaks as weapons. The scientists want to finally answer this question by conducting detailed biomechanical research on 3D models of the creature’s head.    The psychedelic drug LSD could have therapeutic uses.

The researchers are hoping to use MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and magnetoencephalography to monitor the brain activity of people when they take the psychedelic drug LSD. They believe the drug could have therapeutic potential and that it is time to end the 50-year stigma surrounding its use. They hypothesise that it could “reset” normal brain function in people struggling to cope with addiction and depression.

The haunting call of the spotted hyena can be heard from several miles away, but scientists know very little about what these calls mean.

The researchers want to use recordings of calls to investigate the associated behaviours.

That passion is also why I chose to amputate my right leg. It was badly damaged in 2010, in a near-fatal car accident. I was driving along British Columbia’s notorious Coquihalla Highway in a snow storm. I skidded on black ice, spun, and the car flipped on its roof and into the path of a lorry. Three days later, I woke from an induced coma: my right femur was shattered into 17 pieces and my ankle smashed. Three surgeons wanted to amputate the leg; a fourth argued I was still young and might recover. The first six months back home were perpetual agony. Somehow my parents and girlfriend Sonja got me through. Above the knee, the leg began to heal, but the bone tissue lower down was dying. My foot deteriorated and the toes curled under, like a tiger’s claw. I couldn’t step on it and my calf muscle wasted away. I became depressed and realised I couldn’t be the dad I’d imagined for my daughters, then seven and three. I’d dreamed of skiing with them. Now that would never happen. Doctors suggested fixing the ankle at 90 degrees with screws. Eventually, the bone would collapse, but it could take 20 years. It would mean repeated surgery and medication. I couldn’t live like that. My surgeon never spoke about an elective amputation, but after a year of researching options, I proposed it to him. He agreed. Friends and family didn’t understand and insisted I got a second opinion – they thought medicine might develop a magic cure – so I visited numerous specialists; one even said I was insane. But I knew it was the right decision. I had to wait a year and a half before I was fit for the operation. I spoke to amputees and posed in front of the mirror with my knee bent, so I could imagine how it would look. My personal trainer, an amputee ironman triathlete, lent me his prosthetic leg for one photo. There were moments of doubt. Weeks before the operation, I felt better and began walking without crutches; one day I hiked for two hours. Maybe, I thought, I don’t need an amputation? But the next week I was in severe pain. The leg had to go. Telling my daughters was tough. To help them understand, we watched Dolphin Tale, a film about a dolphin that has its tail amputated. My little one was fine, but my eldest was devastated. When the time came, I felt ready. After 18 months’ preparation, I joked that it was as if I had a PhD in amputation. There was a risk the leg wouldn’t heal after the operation. Lying in surgery, I had one final request: could I keep my leg? The hospital wanted to throw it away, which seemed disrespectful after 40 years together; I wanted it cremated. When I woke and saw the stump, a wave of relief passed over me – this anchor dragging me down was gone. Life was beginning again. But my recovery wasn’t straightforward. The wound got infected and took four months to heal. Acute phantom pains shot into the void left by my foot. It felt like I was on fire or being stabbed. Again, my family supported me. My daughters teased their one-legged dad and strapped teddies to my stump. They had a Barbie with a broken leg that they called Amputee Barbie. There were other funny moments: when Sonja collected the ashes from the crematorium, she took great pleasure in asking for the remains of her still-living partner. When I finally got my prosthetic leg, I walked without crutches on the first day. The second day I rode a bike and the third I drove my car. It was painful, but everything seemed possible. Within six months, I skied with my girls, using a specially-adapted ski leg. Gliding down the slopes, I felt incredibly grateful and positive. I proposed to Sonja and we married in August. I’m now training to be the first amputee to race the Dakar Rally on my motorbike in 2016. I’ve never regretted the amputation. Others may have found a sedentary job and lived happily with a damaged leg, but that’s just not me. • As told to Gabriella Jóźwiak. Do you have an experience to share?

It was on 15 June 1215 that King John, in the meadow of Runnymede beside the Thames between Windsor and Staines, sealed (not signed) the document now known as the Magna Carta. Today, jets taking off from London Heathrow airport come up over Runnymede and then often turn to fly down its whole length before vanishing into the distance. Yet it is not difficult to imagine the scene, during those tense days in June 1215, when Magna Carta was being negotiated, the great pavilion of the king, like a circus top, towering over the smaller tents of barons and knights stretching out across the meadow. The Magna Carta is a document some 3,550 words long written in Latin, the English translation being “Great Charter”. Much of it, even in a modern translation, can seem remote and archaic. It abounds in such terms as wainage, amercement, socage, novel disseisin, mort d’ancestor and distraint. Some of its chapters seem of minor importance: one calls for the removal of fish weirs from the Thames and Medway. Yet there are also chapters which still have a very clear contemporary relevance. Chapters 12 and 14 prevented the king from levying taxation without the common consent of the kingdom. Chapter 39 laid down that “No free man is to be arrested, or imprisoned, or diseised [dispossessed], or outlawed, or exiled, or in any way destroyed, nor will we go against him, nor will we send against him, save by the lawful judgement of his peers or by the law of the land.” In chapter 40 the king declared that “To no one will we sell, to no one will we deny or delay, right or justice.” In these ways, the Charter asserted a fundamental principle – the rule of law. The king was beneath the law, the law the Charter itself was making. He could no longer treat his subjects in an arbitrary fashion. It was for asserting this principle that the Charter was cherished by opponents of Charles I, and called in aid by the founding fathers of the United States. When on trial for his life in 1964, Nelson Mandela appealed to Magna Carta, alongside the Petition of Rights and the Bill of Rights, “documents which are held in veneration by democrats throughout the world”. Chapters 39 and 40 are still on the statute book of the UK today. The headline of a Guardian piece in 2007 opposing the 90-day detention period for suspected terrorists was “Protecting Magna Carta”.    The founding fathers sign The Declaration of Independence. Photograph: Museum of the City of New York/Corbis   The anniversary has inspired a great deal of scholarly work. The Magna Carta Project has made many new discoveries, and numerous public events are planned. In February all four surviving originals of the 1215 Charter, are being brought together for the first time, and will be displayed first at the British Library and then in the Houses of Parliament. The British Library is putting on an exhibition, Magna Carta: Law, Liberty, Legacy, which traces the history of the document from its origins to the present day. Apart from numerous documents and artefacts from the Charter’s first century, the exhibits will include the first printed edition of Magna Carta published in 1508, so small that it can fit into the palm of your hand, Thomas Jefferson’s handwritten copy of the Declaration of Independence (1776), and the Delaware copy of the United States Bill of Rights (1790). On the anniversary itself, there will be a great ceremony at Runnymede. If members of Her Majesty’s government attend, let us hope they remember that the Charter was aimed at the activities of their forebears. In 1215 there was nothing new in the ideas behind the Charter. They were centuries old and part of general European heritage. Strengthened in the 12th century by the study of Roman and canon law, they can be found in legislation and constitutions promulgated in Spain, Hungary and the south of France. It was in England, however, that they led to the most radical and detailed restrictions on the ruler. That was because in England the ruler was uniquely demanding and intrusive, thanks to the pressures of maintaining a continental empire, which stretched from Normandy to the Pyrenees. By the time of John’s accession in 1199, there was already outcry at the level of the king’s financial demands. They were to become far worse. After John had lost Normandy and Anjou to the king of France in 1204, he spent 10 years in England amassing the cash needed to recover his empire, in the process tripling his revenues. In 1214 the eventual campaign of recovery ended in total failure. John returned to England, his money spent and his prestige in tatters. Next year his baronial enemies rebelled and forced him to concede Magna Carta. Their grievances were not just financial. Although paying lip service to the principles of custom and consent, John’s rule had been lawless. He took hostages at will, deprived barons of lands and castles without legal process, and demanded large sums of money to assuage his rancour and recover his goodwill. In a chivalrous age, which expected noble captives to be treated with courtesy, he was cruel. He murdered both his nephew Arthur and the most famous woman of the age, Matilda de Briouze. She and her eldest son were starved to death in the dungeons of Corfe castle. As a contemporary writer put it, John was “brimful of evil qualities”.    The execution of King Charles I – whose opponents cited the Magna Carta – at Whitehall on 30 January 1649. Photograph: Alamy   In 1215, John was, therefore, placed beneath the law, but the Magna Carta of 1215 was very far from giving equal treatment to all the king’s subjects. Socially it was a divided and divisive document, often reflecting the interests of a baronial elite a few hundred strong in a population of several millions. Having asserted that taxation required the common consent of the kingdom, the assembly giving that consent was to be attended primarily by earls, barons, bishops and abbots. There was no place for London and other towns, although the Londoners thought that there should be. There was no place for knights elected by and representing the counties, although the Charter elsewhere assigned important roles to elected knights. In other words, there was no equivalent of the House of Commons. At least, in the chapter on taxation, the good and great of the realm could be seen as protecting the rest of the king’s subjects from arbitrary exactions. But the king’s subjects were far from sharing equally in the Charter’s benefits. Indeed, the unfree villeins, who made up perhaps half the population, did not formally share in those benefits at all. The liberties in the Charter were granted not to “all the men” of the kingdom, but to “all the free men”. It was likewise only freemen who were protected from arbitrary imprisonment and dispossession by chapter 39. As far as Magna Carta was concerned, both king and lords remained perfectly free to dispossess their unfree tenants at will. The threat of doing so was a vital weapon for control of the peasant workforce. Chapter 40’s “To no one will we deny, delay or sell right or justice” seemed more inclusive. But this was less helpful to the unfree than it seemed. It was the law itself that laid down that villeins had no access to the king’s courts in any matter concerning their land and services. These were entirely for the lord to determine. As one lawbook put it, “a villein when he wakes up in the morning, does not know what services he must perform for his lord by night”. The one chapter in the Charter which specifically protected the unfree was less than it seemed. Under chapter 20, fines imposed on villeins were to match the offence and be assessed by local men. During the negotiations at Runnymede, this chapter was redrafted to make it clear that the fines in question were those imposed by the king. In other words, they did not apply at all to fines imposed by lords. Magna Carta also reflected the inequalities between men and women, and in particular the way women played a very limited part in public affairs. The Charter gives the names of 34 men. Three women are mentioned: John’s queen, and the sisters of King Alexander II of Scotland. Not one was named. It is true that “man” could be understood at the time of the Charter to mean simply “human being”. The “no freeman” of chapter 39 thus protected free women. Indeed, the chapter owed something to the way John had “destroyed” Matilda de Briouze.    Nelson Mandela, who referred to the Magna Carta during his 1964 trial. Photograph: Alexander Joe/AFP/Getty   But the chapter also demonstrated the inequalities between the sexes. If a free woman secured judgment of her peers (that is social equals), under its terms those peers would have been entirely male for women did not sit on juries. Chapter 39 also forgot about women altogether when it spoke of outlawry, for women were not outlawed they were “waived”, which meant left as a “waif”. This had the same effect. A waived woman could be killed on sight just like an outlawed man. But the distinction showed how subject women were to men. Women took no oath of allegiance to the king because in theory they were always under the protection of a man – father, husband or lord. They were, therefore, never “in law” and so could not be “oulawed”, hence they were “waived” instead. In 1215 itself both John and his enemies would have been astonished had they known that the Charter would live on and be celebrated 800 years hence. Especially as within a few months of its promulgation, Magna Carta seemed a dead letter. John had got the pope to quash it. (The magnificent papal bull in which he did so is a star exhibit in the British Library exhibition.) The barons, likewise abandoning the Charter, deposed John and elected another king in his place, none other than Prince Louis, the eldest son of the king of France. The Charter only survived because, after John’s death in October 1216, the minority government of his son, the nine-year-old Henry III, accepted what John had rejected. In order to win the war against Louis, and, having won the war, consolidate the peace, they issued new versions of the Charter. Then, in 1225, in order to secure a great tax, they issued what became the final and definitive Magna Carta. It is chapters of Henry III’s Charter of 1225, not John’s of 1215, which remain on the Statute Book. Indeed in the 13th century, it was Henry’s Charter of 1225 which was called “Magna Carta”; John’s Charter of 1215 was more often called just “the Charter of Runnymede”. The name Magna Carta itself had only appeared in 1218 to distinguish the Great Charter from the smaller Charter dealing with the royal forest which Henry III issued alongside it. It was not till the 17th century that John’s Charter recovered its place centre stage and became called Magna Carta. That, however, was fair enough for in its essence and in much of its detail the Charter of 1225 replicated that of 1215. Without John’s Charter, there would have been no Charter of Henry III. In 1215 Magna Carta was an elitist document, yet by the end of the 13th century it had become known across society, and all sections of society, legitimately or not, were laying claim to its benefits. The originals issued between 1215 and 1225, and subsequent confirmations, spawned numerous copies, thanks in large part to the activities of the church whose liberty was protected in chapter one. Such was the thirst for knowledge of the Charter that many of the copies were of unofficial versions derived from drafts made at Runnymede. Already in 1215 itself the Charter had been translated from Latin into French, the vernacular language of the nobility. By the end of the 13th century the Charter was being proclaimed in English, the language of everyone else. In around 1300, the peasants of Bocking in Essex (later a centre of the 1381 peasants’ revolt) appealed to Magna Carta in a struggle against their lord’s bailiff. In the 1350s, legislation defined the “no free man” as “no man of whatever condition”. The Charter seemed increasingly to have a universal application. It had established the base from which it would go around the world. Its appeal lay not in its precise details, but in its assertion of the rule of law. Everything is of its own time, but only some ideas are taken up and spread. When human rights are still trampled on in many parts of the world, what happened in a meadow by the Thames 800 years ago retains its significance. Let us hope Magna Carta will still be celebrated 100 years from now. • David Carpenter’s new translation of Magna Carta is published as a Penguin Classic.",,,

Still, Marc Cerrone may be about to have his day in the sun. New compilation The Best Of Cerrone Productions collects his finest solo tracks alongside stuff from his old band Kongas and work for films such as sexploitation thriller Brigade Mondaine. Whereas Moroder pushed production boundaries and Rodgers enjoyed big pop success, Cerrone’s style was aimed firmly at the dancefloor, with a hint of kitsch. “Giorgio’s more electro, Nile is more funk than me,” Cerrone explains from Paris. “I’m somewhere in the middle. It’s the French touch.” Cerrone’s music has inspired nu-disco scions such as Lindstrøm and Todd Terje, as well as LCD Soundsystem and Goldfrapp, whose album Supernature was named after his most famous single. There are traces, too, of Kongas’s Africanism in Mark Ronson’s Uptown Funk, while the string-adorned Love In C Minor practially defined the slick Studio 54 sound.    Cerrone spent 22 years in the US, tempted away from France when copies of Love In C Minor were accidentally shipped to New York in 1976 and the DJs went mad for it. “I knocked on Atlantic Records’ door and a guy told me: ‘Ahmet Ertegün wants to see you,’” he says. “I signed the contract right away.” Love In C Minor sold 3m copies, so Cerrone set up camp, pumping out immaculate disco smashes including Je Suis Music, Look For Love and the Billboard Dance chart No 1 Supernature, all packaged in sleeves that portrayed Cerrone as a louche playboy figure with cars, girls and martinis on tap. The fantasy couldn’t last forever: the hits dried up around 1979 when he started using his own vocals – a lesson for Calvin Harris, there – and when 1980’s Cerrone VI failed to get a US release, he retreated. Cerrone continued to make albums throughout the 80s, but to lessening returns. In 1992, he staged a relatively successful Broadway show called Dreamtime, but the cost of moving the hi-tech production to another theatre meant that its run was short-lived. Now Cerrone finds himself in a more welcoming time, where disco is revered rather than dismissed as corny. Whether he’ll be able emulate Moroder, whose forthcoming new album features Kylie and Britney, remains to be seen. But Cerrone is planning both a live and a DJ tour, sensing a second chance. “I feel EDM is coming to an end and we need something else,” he says. “It’s like a freeway is opening up in front of me.” The Best Of Cerrone Productions is out on 12 Jan on Because Music    ",profile/matthew-horton,horton,matthew
252,2015-01-02T14:00:13Z,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/02/vera-brittain-remarkable-life,"Testament of Youth – Vera Brittain and her remarkable life
",books,Books,The Guardian,"There wasn’t much encouragement in Buxton for a girl who wanted to go to Oxford, but Vera Brittain ignored the disapproving looks, went to Extension lectures, studied and struggled, almost walked out of her entrance exams, and got herself a place at Somerville in 1914. That’s a 20th-century story in itself, but it turned out not to be the central story of Brittain’s life. By the start of term, there was a war on. Her brother, Edward, and Roland Leighton, the man she loved, were going into the army rather than to New College and Merton respectively. At first the war looked like a frustrating interruption to her plans for a literary career, but Brittain quickly came to understand it as a complete change in the order of things. Everything she had aimed at now seemed irrelevant. She felt little respect for her peers in the library, or for tutors who carried on as if Latin responsions were still important. The men who went off to be heroes were contemptuous of “scholastic vegetation”. Brittain’s ambivalence about Oxford, and the admiration she came to feel with hindsight for the principal of Somerville (the classicist Emily Penrose, whose tenacity resulted in the first degrees for women in 1920), are fascinating strands of her story. Brittain could not join Roland at the front, but she could put herself at the service of men like him by joining the Voluntary Aid Detachment as a nurse. For the next four years, during which she lost, one by one, the people she had ever cared about, she worked with astonishing toughness and skill at hospitals in London, Malta and at the purgatorial clearing station in Étaples in northern France. She had been brought up in a society that insisted on a chaperone being present for a tea date with a man; now she had responsibility for mutilated male bodies. Back in Buxton the Germans were hated, but, under corrugated iron in France, the hand of a dying German soldier felt very much like Roland’s hand. Passionately and clear-sightedly, Brittain tried to make sense of these extraordinary situations. “And some there be, which have no memorial”: when Brittain eventually published Testament of Youth in 1933, she took her epigraph from Ecclesiastes, dedicated the book to her lost fiance and her brother, and determined that it should stand as a permanent commemoration of their short lives. The words on their tombstones were very few; she had written the bare names and dates over and over in her diaries. In her book, she wanted to make room for extravagant quantities of detail: the small frustrations, misunderstandings and momentary triumphs that make up lives, and which are the constituents of social change. Her instinct had always been to collect these things, hence the urgent flow of her diaries and letters, which dried up only in 1918 when all her correspondents were dead and she had no heart to write to herself. Testament of Youth is, in part, a group biography in the time-honoured life-and-letters style, an anthology of material too precious to redact. It is also, and was meant to be, the symbolic story of a generation. This is testimony in the sense of eye-witness evidence: Brittain is particular about the quality of the mud in France, the lack of washing facilities for nurses covered in blood, the wartime difference in meaning between adieu and au revoir.    Vera Brittain in 1956. Photograph: Central Press Photograph: Central Press/Getty Images   The process of adapting this long book for the cinema might well have left only the central love story intact. The poster for James Kent’s new film shows the young couple in yearning farewell (looking made-up and lit), as if we’re going to get an imitation of Brief Encounter with heritage sets and added army glamour. But sceptics should go and see it. Through all the recent centennial events I have rarely felt so close to the tangled aspirations and emotions, the vast incalculable horrors and the grinding tiredness of those years. The Swedish actor Alicia Vikander isn’t nearly pale and exhausted enough to look English, but it doesn’t matter. She is utterly, unshowily convincing, making us feel what it is to be 20 or 21, when everything is most acute, when we are most selfish and most zealously capable of self-denial. She catches precisely the young Brittain’s mix of proud rationalism and impulsiveness, stoicism and vociferous grief. She understands the pull between vehemence and uncertainty in a woman trying all the time to work out what she thinks. Kit Harington (Jon Snow in Game of Thrones) is a thoughtful Roland, returning numb from his first months in France to be shaken by Brittain back into feeling. Many kinds of relationship are brought momentarily into focus. The film honours (where it could easily have cut) Brittain’s serious intention to marry her blinded friend Victor, whom she does not love. And the portrait of Vera’s parents is moving in its very marginality. Brittain’s own account of her “provincial young ladyhood” rendered her parents as the embodiments of all those unimaginative, snobbish conventions from which she had to escape. When, during the war, they called her back from nursing to help at home, Vera was justifiably annoyed, and when she arrived to find her mother not even looking very ill, annoyance turned to fury. How dare they take up her time when there were servicemen who needed her? Later, in her 30s, she reflected on what the war had meant for non-combatants who found themselves watching history from a helpless distance. Later still, her father killed himself, having endured since the death of his son, a grief that Dominic West in the film makes palpable in one desperate howl. Mark Bostridge published his authorised biography of Brittain with Paul Berry in 1995. His long, devoted research revealed much about Brittain’s difficult course towards pacifism and her attempts to fictionalise her war. But, 20 years on, it is difficult to justify his new book, or at least its full-scale price tag. Vera Brittain and the First World War offers an efficient biographical summary, an essay on the evolution of Brittain’s writing and a discussion of adaptations in different media. Though it is fun to read behind-the-scenes anecdotes of how the polished vintage trains at Keighley were artificially weathered, those new to Brittain would do best to read Testament of Youth. Bostridge’s “Afterword”, however, brings one up short, even though he has presented the material before. The official version of Edward Brittain’s death was that he bravely went out to mend wire ahead of a counteroffensive on the Asiago plateau. Vera was sure that she had not been told the truth about her brother’s last hours. Bostridge shows that he probably went out with the intention of being killed, since the alternative he faced was court martial for homosexual indecency on the evidence of an intercepted letter. It is a haunting addition to the toll of sadness. At least it might remind us that, though Testament of Youth feels startlingly contemporary, some things have changed in the last hundred years. • Testament of Youth will open in cinemas on 16 January.

Rodger Ambrose,global,Global,The Guardian,"My lecturer probably never knew why his Guardian was always late. After telling his class that the Guardian was the “world’s finest newspaper” and one “couldn’t be worldly wise without it”, my history lecturer never again got first grab of the sole Guardian that landed weekly on my university library’s periodical shelf. Thereafter I always got to the mint-fresh Guardian first, and made sure no one could carry it away until I was satiated. If that required temporarily hiding its potpourri of knowledge and opinion behind dreary textbooks, well, so be it. That was in 1983 in Launceston, Tasmania. I was taking advantage of the Australian government’s free tertiary education policy and had returned, from six years’ backpacking across the then “third world” for just that educational opportunity. For me, the university’s sole subscription to the Guardian was a bridge to the wide wonderful world that I had just circumnavigated. When later, now suitably credentialed, I backpacked away to what was now dubbed the developing world, I was glad to maintain a lifeline to western liberal thought. From that day in 1983, I never lost the Guardian habit.

Richards used an interview last month to complain of the “unhelpful” legal battles Ofcom fought with Sky after the broadcaster used the courts to challenge a series of rulings by the regulator. They included its landmark ruling in 2010 requiring Sky to offer its sport channels to other pay-TV operators to ensure fair and effective competition, prompting years of legal wrangling. “My regret is that we have spent years and years in court and millions and millions of pounds in a court battle which takes too long, costs too much and I don’t think is particularly helpful,” said Richards. “What we set out to do was promote competition in the context of what was then a highly concentrated market and I think we have achieved that. I think there is now more choice, more competition and more retail innovation.” Graham McWilliam, group director of corporate affairs at Sky, said: “After eight years running Ofcom, Ed Richards could be forgiven for being a little demob happy as he reflects on his time as chief executive. “However, his memory is mistaken if he feels ‘vindicated’ in relation to the long-running legal case over Ofcom’s decision to force Sky to supply certain sports channels at prices set by the regulator,” McWilliam said in a blog post published on Friday. “At this time, the final outcome is yet to be determined and Ofcom’s core argument in favour of intervention has been found in court to be without foundation, the regulator having misinterpreted evidence to a significant extent. Contrary to what Mr Richards appears to suggest, that ruling has not been overturned in subsequent hearings. “While it may be ‘unhelpful’ in his eyes for Ofcom decisions to be subject to appeal, it is hardly surprising that companies should seek independent judicial scrutiny when they believe, as Sky does in this case and as the court has confirmed, that the regulator has made serious mistakes.” The interview, published in the Independent on 29 December, said Richards “felt vindicated” by court rulings in the regulator’s favour. Ofcom launched a public consultation into its 2010 ruling last month, saying Sky’s dominance of UK pay-TV sports rights could still harm competition. Richards, who stepped down from Ofcom at the end of the year, claimed the litigation system was “out of kilter … It’s a bit too easy to appeal the decisions, it’s a bit too easy to delay the effective decisions, a bit too easy for very large companies to throw money at litigation as a tactic, and I think that skews things against smaller companies”. Richards also used the interview to accuse government representatives of showing favouritism to Rupert Murdoch’s companies and said he was “surprised” by the informality of contact between executives and ministers during the failed bid by Murdoch’s News Corporation for BSkyB in 2011. Richards will be succeeded by former Treasury official Sharon White in March. • To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

255,2015-01-02T14:06:00Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/02/alan-bennett-wimbledon-liverpool-fa-cup,Alan Bennett fired up by Wimbledon’s past FA Cup glories against Liverpool,football,Football,The Guardian,"There are some who are adamant that Wimbledon won the 1988 FA Cup final in the tunnel before the game. A couple of players from that side recall how delivering a lexicon of profanities at their Liverpool counterparts gave them a psychological edge, teeing them up for a victory that 27 years later remains one of the competition’s greatest shocks. Alan Bennett, the Dons’ current captain, is unlikely to promote such lairy antics on Monday night but he is confident that the League Two side, 72 places below the Merseysiders in the pyramid, will make it sticky for their lofty opponents and is more than hopeful of producing a similarly dramatic script. “There is one major upset every year – we need to give ourselves the biggest chance of being the ones to produce it,” Bennett says. “We will play up to being the minnows, the fans will make it hostile and we’re going to make sure it’s uncomfortable for them.” Neal Ardley, the AFC Wimbledon manager, had warned his players about giving interviews before their Christmas fixtures, wary that the glamour tie could prove a distraction from league duties. They have won three of their four games since, leaving them four points off the playoffs in 11th position. Finishing in the top seven is the minimum aim according to Bennett – “We haven’t spoken about it in the dressing room but personally I think it is” – but now attentions are firmly trained on the Cup. “It hasn’t been a distraction for me but for some of the younger lads, I think it has been difficult,” he says of the surge of excitement in south-west London. “The day after the draw Neal came in and laid down the law. He said it was a great draw and it will be a great week building up to it but until then we were to forget about it. We were told to do no media and for there to be no talk around the dressing room about it. We had four games and we were told we needed to play well in those to be in the team. That was the right thing to do.” Such a high-profile fixture attracts a unique set of problems. As captain it is Bennett’s duty to distribute tickets to team-mates but Kingsmeadow holds only 4,720. One player asked for 14 tickets but each squad member will only receive two. No wonder some would have preferred a trip to Anfield. Bennett himself had difficulty in deciding who his two tickets should go to. “It’s been mad, my phone was going constantly from the time the draw was made but we can only get two each. A thousand tickets went to Liverpool, while the FA’s share is around 500, so there isn’t too much left over.” Among supporters lucky enough to get a ticket, there has been a fevered sense of anticipation. A third-round debut is another landmark for a club that has battled up the leagues backed solely by supporters. There is, however, an additional pressure for the players born from the club being owned by the fans. Bennett recalls one particular incident early in his time at the club when the team were struggling and some on the terraces were growing restless. “When I signed, the club was bottom of the league and struggling. We went to Bristol Rovers in my second game, lost 1-0 and we were warming down afterwards when a woman, maybe in her 30s, exploded. The rest of the stand was empty, everyone else had gone home but she came down to the barrier and roared abuse at us. It’s so personal for them. She was quick to remind us that it took 10 years for them to get the club into the league. “There have been a couple of incidents like that but when we do well, it is great. I’ll be gone soon along with the rest of the players, the manager will go at some stage but the fans will still be there – they are the club.” Bennett is no stranger to big FA Cup outings, having played for Cheltenham against Tottenham at White Hart Lane in 2012 and at home to Everton in the fourth round in 2013. What he took from those experiences was a realisation that there are noticeable differences between your average League Two and Premier League referee; not least how they define fouls. “We have League Two refs, who ref our games every week and see League Two challenges and understand our football. But then if you get a Premier League referee, it’s quite different and I remember that from the Everton game especially. Maybe this is a personal gripe because I gave away a penalty to [Marouane] Fellaini after winning a header cleanly but connected with him after. I couldn’t believe it – I still can’t now – because it was a clean League Two header. You need a strong ref who can marry the two and handle it.” At 33, Bennett has started planning for life outside football – he recently obtained a degree in sports journalism and broadcasting from Staffordshire University, while he has been taking his coaching badges alongside John Terry among others. The millionaires in red who will line up alongside them on Monday are unlikely to have such worries when it comes to retirement. “I’ve never looked at football as a career really. It has always been a case where at the start of every season I think ‘great, another year playing’, but I know when I retire I’ll need to work. “I guess it shows how we have different motivations – we’re playing to pay the mortgage, the likes of Steven Gerrard are motivated by a completely different set of circumstances,” Bennett says, neatly encapsulating the gulf between the glamour of the Premier League and the graft of the lower leagues. This will likely be the highlight of Bennett’s career despite having played in the Champions League, with his hometown team Cork City in 2006, and possessing two international caps having played for the Republic of Ireland on a US tour in 2007. Looking back there was a touch of farce about the international call-up but it remains a proud moment. “I had just picked up a pair of boots from a shop in Cork when Kevin Doyle phoned me to say Steve Staunton’s assistant [Kevin MacDonald] was going to call. But I had to pretend I had been involved in the squad before because he was under the impression I had been, so when the call came I took it all in my stride and next thing I knew I was off to the US. “It’s still a really proud moment. In the Wimbledon programme notes I’m listed as an Irish international and sometimes as a Champions League player – it’s difficult explaining that one to the lads. My brother was working over there illegally at the time, in Boston, and I had not seen him for five or six years so it was brilliant that he could come to watch me play.” Surprising Brendan Rodgers’s team would top the lot, however. “This is the biggest of all. Along with Man United, Chelsea and Arsenal, Liverpool is the biggest draw you could get. And although it would have been nice getting to Anfield, who knows, we might get there yet.” Spurred on by Wimbledon’s past glories against Liverpool, the current version, led by Bennett, will look to become another set of History Boys.",profile/alan-smith,smith,alan

Announced before the Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie (SIHH) 2015 watch trade show in Geneva, the €350 (£273) accessory is not Montblanc’s first foray into the world of technology, previously producing stylus accessories for Samsung’s Galaxy Note 4 phablet. ‘Smartwatches as the evolution of the digital watch’ But along with similar moves from Swatch, Timex and Fossil, it shows that smartwatches are no longer just the domain of technology companies. “We’ve seen interest in smartwatches from traditional watch manufacturers such as Fossil and Casio, which has G Shock models already available with Bluetooth connectivity,” Gartner research director Angela McIntyre explained to the Guardian. The reason for that interest in connected watches is clear – the potential market for smartwatches is large. “We could think of smartwatches as the evolution of the digital watch – they’ve been around for decades with a digital display, but now they have the capability to be connected,” explained McIntyre. “According to Statistics Brain, there are 1.2bn traditional watches sold every year and 23% of those are digital watches.” “Even if just a small percentage of digital watches become connected, that’s a lot of smartwatches.” ‘Unsure of the benefits and relevance’ Technology companies, including Apple, which is set to join Google with a smartwatch in the spring, are already battling for a slice of the market. That riled traditional watch makers, who saw their watch faces easily replicated in the digital form. Omega, Fossil, Armani, Michael Kors, Tissot, Swatch and Mondaine among others sent cease and desist notices to sites and developers offering faces thought to infringe on their copyright without permission in November. Some watch manufacturers, including Timex and Fossil, have partnered with technology companies Qualcomm and Intel. Others including the world’s biggest watch manufacturer Swatch are going it alone, leaning on their existing expertise. Expectations for smartwatches from both technology companies and traditional watch manufacturers are high around the world’s biggest electronics trade show CES in Las Vegas next week and SIHH 2015 in Geneva in the middle of January. Whether watchmakers will finally be able to turn what is widely considered to be simply a gadget on the wrist into something more akin to current watches and jewellery remains to be seen. As it stands awareness of smartwatches is good, but ownership is low, with just 1% of Britons owning one, according to research by Ipsos Mori. “Consumers are unsure of the benefits and relevance of the product, with nearly half (47%) saying that they didn’t see a need for them to have one, and 18% citing them as ‘gimmicks’,” Andrew Maguire, associate director at Ipsos Mori. “Just under a quarter - 24% - also mentioned the expense as a reason why they haven’t yet purchased one.” • Click tock: which is the best smartwatch this Christmas? • Forget smartwatches - smartclothes are the future, analysts say",profile/samuel-gibbs,Samuel,Gibbs
258,2015-01-02T14:11:08Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jan/02/art-goalscoring-football-statistics-aguero-bony,Art of goalscoring will never be buried by blizzard of stats,football,Football,The Guardian,"Arsenal’s French scout Gilles Grimandi said something interesting in L’Equipe this week about football’s trend towards stats, data analysis, passing percentage points and all the rest of it. “Statistics,” Grimandi declared, “Give people the chance to exist who have little knowledge.” This isn’t exactly news in itself but Grimandi’s beef is more than the standard curmudgeonly dismissal. Players, he said, are well aware of the way clubs use data, and how careers can rise and fall on such numbers. As a result they will often take fewer risks now, refuse to engage in “a duel” they might lose, tread a comfortable line in passing, and literally play a percentage game. The suggestion here is that the way we look at football is changing the way it is played, a footballing variation on the observer principle coined off-hand by a retired French defensive midfielder that is surely the most interesting thing anybody has said about football this week. And which would certainly have been the central theme of this column were it not for the fact the year’s end also brought such a vast gushing spume of stats, numbers and top 10 lists that Grimandi’s First Law Of Uncertainty was immediately buried by the need to absorb the fact Nemanja Matic is statistically the best dribbler at Chelsea, Kolo Touré made more fruitless arm-waggling sprints than any other player in Europe, and that Mathieu Flamini expended more energy waving his arms in 2014 than he did moving his legs to the extent that had Flamini played every match standing on his hands he would have run an extra 1.7km per game and Arsenal would have won the league by five points.    Wilfried Bony. Photograph: Huw Evans/Rex   The only part of the new year stat explosion that carried any real weight was the list of 2014’s top Premier League goalscorers, which was topped, jointly by Sergio Agüero and Wilfried Bony. This seems significant in itself as Bony has already loomed large among the first knockings of the transfer window, with Manchester City reportedly willing to pay up to £30m. Some have questioned the price tag but it isn’t hard to see why City would be interested in a player who offers a highly specific, indissolubly vital skill that cuts across even the numerical vagaries of Grimandi’s Law. Look at a reel of Bony’s goals on YouTube and there he is each time, never quite marked, occupying always that portable little pocket of Bony-space. For all his alluring brawn, Bony is no raging bull but a connoisseur of angles and timing and the most controlled and insistent of finishers. This is the reason his price is so high. Bony may not be from the very top rank but he is undoubtedly a finisher, expert in the one part of football that for all the more numerically obscure methods of attempting to win a match remains pretty much unchanged from the very start of things. There is an interesting point of clarity here. As space has become more compressed on the pitch, margins shrunk, the details by which victory is decided ever more minute, football’s most basic skill seems increasingly decisive. The world’s No1 player in 2014, Cristiano Ronaldo, has evolved precisely this way, paring his game back, moving less rather than more and becoming above all a finisher, a razor edge, a single point of light. With this in mind it seems odd finishing has often been treated as something “instinctive”, an afterthought, a private matter between striker and goalkeeper. I once interviewed a Premier League striker turned manager who five minutes in gave up talking about the FA Cup third round to describe in passionate detail his dream of creating an elite finishing academy to travel the land spreading the gospel, his horror at the fact the most important part of football has no real technical vernacular, and describing a whole range of component parts, from goalkeeper-awareness to far-post percentages, that should be routinely coached as a frontline skill. For all that English football has always produced good finishers. My theory is this happens because, like goalkeeping, finishing happens everywhere. No matter what your methods, how direct your football, the basic skill of finishing remains a feature of every blood and thunder long ball duel, every park level kids’ match played out on a giant scale mud-pit. So English football has provided the languid close range brilliance of Jimmy Greaves, the street-magician craft of Robbie Fowler and the dead-eye incision of Gary Lineker, who often seemed to have drifted in from some other more civilised place, like a neighbour popped in for a New Year’s drink lurking tactfully in the kitchen being polite and refilling the crisp bowls while everybody else trashes the living room carpets and vomits over the bannisters. Of the current English lot Daniel Sturridge is an expertly supple and varied finisher, while Danny Welbeck looks at times like an anti-finisher, a player whose brilliantly athletic, incisive approach work so often ends with a spasm of panic. And really in Welbeck the basic superpower of the genuine finisher becomes a little clearer. It is the same ability a great batsman or a great tennis player has to pause time for a frame or two, to find a moment of stillness in the most complex of split-second mechanical movements. There are one or two outstanding specialists in the Premier League. Wayne Rooney has become a high-grade finisher, right down to his recent habit of angling his body, like a penalty-taker, to send a goalkeeper the wrong way. Best of all is surely Agüero, who seems to have that stillness with him always, and who even while scoring that last-ditch title-winning goal against QPR appears to pause for millisecond to perfect his stride, adjust his angle to the ball, gilding the moment, making it perfect. Grimandi may be right. The blizzard of peripheral numbers may or may not be changing the way football is played, lassoing it with a restrictive self-awareness, but there is a heartening note of constancy in the enduring fascination with football’s endnote, its oldest, most indivisible basic skill.",profile/barneyronay,Barney,Ronay

Image: PA  David Cameron is pitching his tent in the middle This approach is in some ways reminiscent of Angela Merkel’s “Die Mitte” - the middle - slogan. When a country is divided, don’t sway to the hysterics of the right or the left, go with the middle.

People in Berlin wait for a bus near a giant election campaign poster featuring the hands of German chancellor Angela Merkel. Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty Images  The underlying thrust of this first Tory message is to push the economy up the ladder of voters’ concerns. Voters trust different parties to handle different issues. Labour is most trusted in managing the health service, Ukip are viewed as most sensitive to voters’ worries when it comes to immigration, while the Tories are seen as best at dealing with the economy. Because of this, the issue which voters are most concerned about - relative to the other issues they care about - will influence who they vote for in May. This leaves parties with a difficult balancing act. They need to have a position on the topics voters feel are most important. But, in parallel to this, they need to make the issues where they’re most trusted on, the more salient ones. Simply put, David Cameron needs the economy to be top of mind, and for voters to feel that the issue is of upmost concern. There are two main challenges to the Conservatives’ chosen lane.  Firstly, while Cameron is more popular than Labour leader Ed Miliband, he is no Merkel when it comes to trust among voters.    A fundamental lack of trust makes any act that requires convincing voters to entrust the economy into a party’s hands a lot more complicated. Secondly, in terms of issues that voters feel are most important, the economy has been trending downwards since 2010.    With immigration now the issue of most concern - and by some margin.    In 1980, trailing in the polls, Ronald Reagan looked into the camera during a presidential debate, and told voters: “Ask yourself: Are you better off than you were four years ago? Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago? Is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago? Is America as respected throughout the world as it was? Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we’re as strong as we were four years ago?” On 4 November of that year, he defeated Jimmy Carter, and became the 40th President of the United States.  The UK election will be more complex than simply asking voters if they’re better off than five years ago. Like in 2010, the poster campaigns will soon become far more diverse. Roles will be reversed, but as in most elections, the warnings of a return to a past to fear, alongside calls to vote for change, are both likely to feature soon.    A Labour Party poster campaign depicted Conservative Party leader David Cameron as TV detective Gene Hunt, designed to revive memories of 1980’s social unrest and youth unemployment. Photograph: Labour Party/PA     Conservative leader David Cameron addresses the media in 2010. Photograph: Ray Tang / Rex Features  The problem for both Labour and the Conservatives is that while they set to party like it’s 2010, a lot has in fact changed over the past five years. Debates over the union and unity, with Scotland and in Europe, remain divisive. Combined support for the two main parties is at record lows - and this same lack of trust is also what has led to the current fragmentation among the British electorate. Research by Ipsos Mori has found that this particular trend is unlikely to change any time soon.       But for now, it’s a blue sky and a country road taking the message home.

260,2015-01-02T14:24:00Z,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/02/bollywood-film-pk-hindu-nationalist-protests-india-aamir-khan,Bollywood film fans fall in love with PK despite Hindu nationalist protests,film,Film,The Guardian,"If aliens were to land in India today they would be greeted by a bewildering spectacle – while hordes of film buffs gather outside cinemas to see the latest Bollywood blockbuster, an angry mob waves saffron-coloured flags and calls for the arrest of the movie’s hero for allegedly defaming Hinduism. PK, a hugely successful yet controversial film, is turning out to be the strangest phenomenon to emerge from a Bollywood studio. Even as Hindu leaders call for a ban on the film, it has grossed more than 4.82bn rupees (£49.1m) worldwide in its first two weeks, making it the second most successful Bollywood film of all time. As it began its third week in cinemas on Friday, there was little doubt that if film fans continue to snub PK’s vociferous and occasionally violent critics, the movie will become the biggest money-spinner in Bollywood box office history, overtaking 2013’s Dhoom 3 (£54.7m).    Protesters burn a poster of the film PK outside a cinema in Ghaziabad, India. Photograph: Hindustan Times/Getty Images   Aamir Khan, one of Bollywood’s biggest stars, plays PK’s eponymous lead, an alien who gets left behind by his spaceship in the Rajasthan desert and stumbles on to the hypocrisy and deceit in organised religion. PK then sets about exposing a Hindu “godman”, a term for a particularly charismatic guru who may claim to have paranormal powers. The extraterrestrial social crusader resembles Mad magazine’s jug-eared mascot Alfred E Neuman, and often behaves like Mr Bean. PK contains all the ingredients that a big-budget Bollywood film uses to attract audiences – song, dance, romance, melodrama, comedy, incredible plot twists. The rollicking satire also packs a message, something typical of films by director Rajkumar Hirani, who first had international success with 3 Idiots, also starring Khan. Bollywood films have successfully lampooned godmen before, most recently in Oh My God! But PK hit the screens after the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) came to power last year on the wings of a strong popular mandate for its leader, Narendra Modi.    As a result, newly empowered radical Hindu organisations affiliated to the BJP pounced on PK after its release. Nationwide protests are being organised outside cinemas, even vandalising a few and forcing some to cancel screenings. Complaints have also been filed with the police and in courts demanding a ban on the film and the arrest of its director and star. The influential yoga guru Baba Ramdev has even asked for a social boycott of everyone associated with the film. “People think a hundred times while talking against Islam,” he said. “However, when it comes to Hinduism any one gets up and says anything, this is shameful.” PK (the title is a play on the Hindi word for being drunk) also has an elaborate side story that has further upset Hindu nationalists – the heroine falls in love with a Pakistani, is heartbroken when she thinks he has ditched her, but is eventually reunited with her Muslim boyfriend by the film’s lead. At a time when militant Hindu groups are conducting a high-decibel campaign against Indian Muslim men marrying Hindu women (a practice labelled “Love Jihad”), this is not a denouement that gets the approval of the religious right. It does not help that Khan is an Indian Muslim of Pashtun lineage. So the hidden hand of Pakistan’s military intelligence agency ISI has also been sighted. “Who financed the PK film? According to my sources it is traceable to Dubai and ISI. DRI [India’s revenue intelligence agency] must investigate,” tweeted BJP leader Subramanian Swamy. Indians, however, appear to have fallen in love with the film, despite the protests, accepting Khan’s defence: “We respect all religions.” Even Bollywood actors have tweeted support. “Is PK not an amazzziiiiing film?” said Salman Khan. Pooja Bedi tweeted:  God wants SPIRITUAL FRUIT.. not RELIGIOUS NUTS!! LLet's  support #PK— Pooja Bedi (@poojabeditweets) December 29, 2014  The hullabaloo appears to have sowed confusion in the BJP camp. In Mumbai, after a junior minister announced a police inquiry into PK, the BJP chief minister of Maharashtra state ruled out any action against the film. And even as angry Hindus smashed cinema foyers, BJP veteran leader Lal Krishna Advani hailed PK as “a wonderful and courageous film”. But the one person whose opinion the public are usually keen to hear has remained silent. Though Modi loves to hold forth on social and cultural issues, he has not uttered a word yet on the PK drama.",profile/maseehrahman,rahman,maseeh
261,2015-01-02T14:30:13Z,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jan/02/johann-hari-interview-drugs-book-independent,"Johann Hari: ‘I failed badly. When you harm people, you should shut up, go away and reflect on what happened'",media,Media,The Guardian,"When I heard that Johann Hari had written a book about the war on drugs, two immediate concerns sprang to mind. The first was whether anyone would trust a word he wrote. The author used to be the Independent’s star columnist, a prolific polemicist and darling of the left, until his career imploded in disgrace when it emerged in 2011 that many of his articles contained quotes apparently said to him but in fact lifted from his interviewees’ books, or from previous interviews by other journalists. Worse, he was exposed as a “sockpuppet”, or someone who anonymously furthers his own interests online. Using a false identity, Hari had maliciously amended the Wikipedia pages of journalists he disliked – among them the Telegraph columnist Cristina Odone and the Observer’s Nick Cohen – accusing them of antisemitism, homophobia and other toxic falsehoods. Under the same pseudonym, he had also edited his own Wikipedia page, lavishly flattering his profile to, as he puts it, “big myself up”. The Independent suspended him, four months later he resigned, and no British newspaper has published his journalism since. He has never spoken publicly about the scandal, until now. My other worry was whether anyone would want to read yet another polemic about drugs. I wouldn’t, and I’m quite interested in the subject. The prohibition-versus-legalisation debate tends to be interminably dreary, chiefly because neither side ever seems to change anybody’s mind. “I think that’s totally right,” Hari agrees. “I did not want to write a 400-page polemic about the drug war. I didn’t want to have an argument about it, I wanted to understand it.” For that matter, he admits, “It’s struck me that, actually, polemic very rarely changes people’s minds about anything.” He says so as a former columnist? “A recovering former columnist, yes.” He laughs. “It’s not just that polemic doesn’t change people’s minds. It says nothing about the texture of lived experience. People are complex and nuanced, they don’t live polemically.” Hari’s book turns out to be a page-turner, full of astonishing revelations. I had no idea that the war on drugs was single-handedly invented by a racist ex-prohibition agent, who needed to find a new problem big enough to protect his departmental budget. One of the first victims of his ambition was Billie Holiday, whose heroin addiction enraged him to the point where he hounded her to death. After he’d had the singer jailed for drugs, she was stripped of her performing licence, and as she unravelled into destitution and despair, his agents continued to harass her, even summoning a grand jury to indict her as she lay dying under police guard in a hospital bed.   The opposite of addiction is not sobriety. The opposite of addiction is human connection  Johann Hari    Hari travelled all over the world meeting other casualties of the drug war: a transsexual former crack dealer in Brooklyn; a homeless junkie in Vancouver who mobilised the local heroin addicts into activists and rewrote the city’s drug laws; a housewife from Ciudad Juárez who marched across Mexico to shame the politicians and cartels protecting her daughter’s murderer. Woven between the human dramas are Malcolm Gladwell-ish examinations of the surprising science and statistics of drug use, and of the varying success of drug policies. Hari goes to Portugal, where all drug possession was decriminalised 13 years ago, and where even the police chief of the Lisbon drug squad now admits, “The things we were afraid of didn’t happen.” He also visits Tent City, a prison in the Arizona desert where the inmates live in tents in temperatures of 44C, wear T-shirts proclaiming I AM BREAKING THE NEED FOR WEED or I WAS A DRUG ADDICT, and are shackled into a chain gang every day and marched in public while reciting chants of repentance. I’ve got to know Hari a bit over the past two years, and it’s quite hard to picture him in the badlands of the drug war. He doesn’t look much like an underworld adventurer. He could pass for almost a decade younger than his 35 years, is slightly knock-kneed and prone to giggly yelps, and readily admits he can’t be trusted to make it to the corner shop and back without getting lost. His north London flat, where we meet, is full of books and almost nothing else, its sole concession to domesticity a massive flatscreen TV. Hari puts his general air of unworldly distraction down to his dyspraxia, but it comes across as donnish. There was nothing academic about his background, growing up in suburban north London in the 80s. His Glaswegian mother worked in a refuge, his Swiss father was a bus driver, and they were pleased but rather puzzled by their son’s obsession with books. “My mum and my dad and my brother all left school when they were 16. I was the first person in my family to go to a fancy university.” After graduating with a double first in social and political sciences from Cambridge, he joined the New Statesman and quickly established his name as a columnist. He was hired by the Independent, where he won Young Journalist of the Year in 2003 and became the youngest ever recipient of the George Orwell prize in recognition of his political reporting.    Johann Hari: “I want to make it clear that I’m not in any way attributing anything I did to that drug use. They are totally separate things.” Photograph: Richard Saker   As a journalist, Hari wrote a lot about the war on drugs, and was always a passionate opponent. His book is presented as an objective investigation, but did it really change his mind about anything? “Oh yes. I think the thing that shocked me the most was the stuff about addiction. I thought I knew about addiction. But addiction is not what we’ve been told it is at all.” When Hari began the book three years ago, he was familiar with the two prevailing theories: people become dependent on drugs either because they lack self-control, or because the chemicals are so inherently addictive that they hijack the brain. Addiction is a moral weakness, or it is a disease, but implicit in either analysis is the theoretical possibility that if we could get rid of the drugs, we would solve the problem. One of Hari’s earliest memories is of trying to rouse a relative from a drug-induced stupor, and his ex-boyfriend is a crack and heroin addict. “So I’d seen addiction in people I loved, and I could see it wasn’t that they were just selfish, morally flawed people. I never believed that. So I erred towards thinking, well, obviously it must be a disease.” Seminal experiments conducted on rats in the 70s appeared to have proved this. Offered a choice between pure water and water laced with heroin, the rats quickly became addicted to the opiate and kept taking the drug until it killed them. But something didn’t add up. “Every day, all over the world, hospital patients are given medical heroin, diamorphine, very often for long periods. And virtually none of them afterwards goes out and tries to score on the street. Which made me think, the issue here can’t just be the drug.” Hari went to Vancouver to meet a psychology professor, Bruce Alexander, who had been similarly puzzled, so had replicated the original experiments. This time, instead of experimenting on solitary rats locked in empty cages, he offered the choice of clean or drugged water to rats kept in what he called Rat Park, a kind of rat heaven full of wheels and coloured balls and delicious food, and other rats to play and mate with. When these rats tried heroin, they weren’t very interested. “They just didn’t like it. None of them overdosed. Even more strikingly, he then took rats that had become addicted in the isolated cages, and put them into Rat Park. And they almost immediately stopped using. What Alexander had found is that we’ve fundamentally misunderstood what addiction is. It isn’t a moral failing. It isn’t a disease. Addiction is an adaptation to your environment. It’s not you; it’s the cage you live in.” The book is populated by a compelling cast of meth users, junkies and crack addicts. Other than addiction, what they have in common is heartbreaking early trauma and abuse. Childhood violence and prostitution, abandonment and homelessness, all led their victims to the same remedy: a narcotic anaesthetic for pain and loneliness. “Human beings have an innate need to bond. Healthy, happy people bond with other humans. But if you can’t do that because you’re so traumatised by your childhood that you can’t trust people, you may well bond with a drug instead.” The scientific evidence of the correlation is so overwhelming, Hari writes, that “child abuse is as likely to cause drug addiction as obesity is to cause heart disease”.   Child abuse is as likely to cause drug addiction as obesity is to cause heart disease  Johann Hari    “What I learned is that the opposite of addiction is not sobriety,” Hari says. “The opposite of addiction is human connection. And I think that has massive implications for the war on drugs. The treatment of drug addicts almost everywhere in the world is much closer to Tent City than it is to anything in Portugal. Our laws are built around the belief that drug addicts need to be punished to stop them. But if pain and trauma and isolation cause addiction, then inflicting more pain and trauma and isolation is not going to solve that addiction. It’s actually going to deepen it.” He breaks off, looking anxious. “But I didn’t tell their stories, because I thought they were a better way of persuading people of an argument. It’s a book of stories about people, because I think stories are a fundamentally better way of thinking about the world.” Nevertheless, these stories build a compelling case for the legalisation and regulation of drugs. If, as the book suggests, 90% of us can take drugs safely without harming ourselves or others, and criminalising the 10% who can’t only turns them into desperate thieves and prostitutes, then the war on drugs is not merely unwinnable, but inherently counterproductive. But one of the stories Hari tells is mentioned so fleetingly that a reader could blink and miss it. In just a few sentences, Hari writes that he himself had been addicted to a drug for several years. Provigil is an anti-narcolepsy prescription drug, popular among Ivy League students for its reputed power to turbo-charge the brain. When Hari discovered it in 2009, “I thought: great, I’ve maxed out the amount of antidepressants you can use – here’s something that will speed things up even more.” He’d been prescribed the antidepressant Seroxat at 17 and, barring one or two brief breaks, had been taking it ever since. Now, with Provigil, Hari was thrilled to discover, “you can do even more work, and be constantly processing information, and sleep only four hours a night”. He began buying the drug on the internet – and for a while it worked. But when he tried to stop taking it, he failed. “When you’re prone to depression, there can be a strong temptation, or there was for me anyway, to try to accelerate through it – to speed up, to kind of outrun the feelings of depression and I did that for years. “But this is totally unrelated to the things I did wrong journalistically,” he says quickly. “This is really important. I did those things before and during the use of this drug. So I want to make it clear that I’m not in any way attributing anything I did to that drug use. They are totally separate things.” This is the last time he says anything quickly. The moment we come to his scandal, all the animation drains from him; he turns still and pale, and speaks in halting sentences prefaced by painful silences. He stopped taking both Provigil and Seroxat one week after leaving the Independent, but can’t be sure what withdrawal was like because, “It’s hard to separate the challenge of stopping those drugs from the wider challenge of what was happening at that time.” I ask if he would place himself in the 10% vulnerable to addiction, and he says, “Probably at that point, yes. Not now, because I’ve changed the way I live so much that I wouldn’t put myself in that category any more.” But when I ask how his susceptibility relates to his childhood, he falls silent.   I’m ashamed of what I did. I did some things that were really nasty and cruel  Johann Hari    “Look,” he says eventually, “I can talk to you about why what happened in my life happened. But I just think that’s a way of trying to invite sympathy, and that would be weaselly. If you tell a detailed personal story about yourself, you’re inherently asking people to sympathise with you, and actually I don’t think people should be sympathetic to me. I’m ashamed of what I did. I did some things that were really nasty and cruel.” Suspicions began circulating online in 2011, when bloggers noticed uncanny similarities between quotes in Hari’s work and previously published interviews and books. The New Statesman began to dig further, and soon the internet was awash with incriminating examples. At the same time, several journalists who’d clashed with Hari in the past, including Nick Cohen and Cristina Odone, began to wonder in public about the identity of a mysteriously vengeful Wikipedia contributor who’d been editing their pages. He called himself “David Rose” and began issuing inventively elaborate online denials of the accusation that he was really Johann Hari. After his IP address was traced back to the Independent’s offices, the deception crumbled. The humiliation must have been toe-curling, but when I ask how he dealt with it, he says, “I just think that would be asking people to see it from my point of view.” Sympathy should be for the people he smeared online, for the Independent and its readers: “Not for me.” Hari had sounded considerably less remorseful when the plagiarism allegations first surfaced. He found them “bemusing”, he wrote on his website, and justified using quotes interviewees had not said to him because his interviews were “intellectual portraits”. The defence sounded rather grandiosely self-serving – so why should anyone trust his new-found contrition? “I think, when you’re in the middle of being attacked, obviously your defence mechanisms go up and you can’t think clearly. It’s the moment when you most need your good judgment and are the least able to bring it.” The mystery is why someone so clever could have behaved so stupidly. I ask Hari to explain what he’d been thinking, and he literally winces. “I’m very reluctant to go into a personal narrative and give the why. Most people restrain their self-aggrandising and cruel impulses, and I failed to. I failed badly. I think when you do that, when you harm people, you should shut up, go away and reflect on what happened. Going on about myself would just be arrogant and actually repeating being nasty, and that’s what I’m trying not to be. When you fuck up, you should privately reckon with the harm you have caused and you should pay a big price.” When the scandal broke, the George Orwell prize board ordered Hari to return his award. The Independent published a personal apology and sent him off to journalism school in New York on unpaid leave, but in January 2012 he resigned from the paper. Was the price he paid disproportionately high? Hari shakes his head. “It was incredibly humiliating, yes. It was absolutely devastating, and I fell apart. But I would not want to live in a culture where people could be horrible about other people under a pseudonym online, or act as if something someone had written had been said directly to you, and not pay a big price for it.” For his new book, Hari has posted audio files online of every interview, so he is obviously worried about his credibility. Does he think this elaborate transparency will restore it? “Well, I fucked up and it’s perfectly right for people to be sceptical. I know I’ve got work to do in regaining trust.” I ask how he thinks his disgrace changed him. “In two really big ways. One was just slowing down; writing much more slowly, living much more slowly, being less work-obsessed.” He is single, and shares his flat with a primary schoolteacher, one of his oldest friends. Most of his friends stood by him through the scandal, and a new one has been Russell Brand, for whom Hari has worked off and on since helping him prepare his 2013 standup tour, Messiah Complex. “We have long political conversations, and sometimes that sparks something useful for him, and then I send him links or books about what we’ve discussed.” He helps produce Brand’s podcast, the Trews, but when I ask about the rumours that he ghost-wrote Revolution, he laughs. “No. I didn’t write a word of it. As I suspect anyone who reads it can tell, those are all Russell’s words.” It’s a relief, he says, not to be “in a state of mania any more, ripped up into a frenzy of constant opinionating and polemicising in my room”. I’m amazed more columnists don’t lose it, unhinged by the insatiable outrage of the Twittersphere, but when I ask if he thinks the register of public debate is becoming dangerous, he smiles. “Funnily enough, one of the good things about not being a columnist is that I don’t have to have an opinion on things like this. You’re probably right, and it sounds very persuasive to me, but I don’t want to join an angry argument against angry arguments.” The other big change, he says, is that “I lost my taste for rendering judgment on people. I think now I’m more interested in understanding why people are the way they are.” What does he miss about his former life as a columnist? This time the silence lasts so long that I wonder if he heard the question. “It was the only job I ever wanted to do,” he says finally, and looks ashen. But he is already working on his next book, and says his new life makes him happier and healthier than his old one ever could. If disgrace turned out to be a release, it still doesn’t feel that way to Hari. “No.” He shakes his head. “I’m not going to present it like a redemptive fable. It was awful, and I wish I hadn’t done it, and I wish I could go back and undo it.”",profile/deccaaitkenhead,Decca,Aitkenhead

The pest-control firm said in 2013 that it had kept a £20m liability that guaranteed the payment of leases on six properties – a mix of offices and depots – after it sold City Link to Jon Moulton’s private equity firm Better Capital for £1. The services company also holds a charge on certain City Link assets which means the proceeds of any sale go to Rentokil to cover those leasehold liabilities, with other creditors, including unpaid staff, placed behind it in the queue for payment. Rentokil declined to comment on the scale of the charge, but well-placed sources said the financial benefit from holding the charge could amount to “several million pounds”. After City Link called in administrators on Christmas Eve, liability for leasing out the six properties returned to Rentokil. Those liabilities are expected to have reduced in scale and the company can reduce them further by subletting the properties, but it may still have to seek money from the City Link administration process to cover the liabilities. The RMT union yesterday called for a full inquiry after more than 2,300 workers at City Link were made redundant this week and up to 1,000 self-employed drivers and agency workers have not been paid for a fortnight’s work after the collapse. Self-employed workers, some of whom are owed more than £20,000, are angry that they were allowed to continue delivering parcels in the run-up to the collapse, incurring fuel and van-leasing costs. Administrators from Ernst & Young were formally appointed on Christmas Eve, with many workers learning about the situation on Christmas Day. Only a month earlier City Link’s managing director, Dave Smith, wrote to suppliers and staff saying rumours of its likely collapse on Christmas Eve were untrue and those found responsible for the rumours would be “pursued through legal process”. Ernst & Young said it would examine directors’ statements as part of a report on their conduct.The government’s Redundancy Payments Service will have to pick up the tab for employees’ redundancy payments. Better Capital has said it expects to recover £20m from City Link, half the £40m loan which underpinned its efforts to revive the parcel carrier. Because it invested in City Link through a series of loans, Better Capital is classed as a secured creditor and is therefore at the front of the queue for recompense, ahead of staff and suppliers.",profile/sarahbutler,Sarah,Butler
263,2015-01-02T14:47:01Z,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/02/opponent-nicaragua-canal-beaten-police,Opponent of Nicaragua canal says he was badly beaten by police,world,World news,The Guardian,"A leading opponent of Nicaragua’s transoceanic canal says he was brutally beaten with batons, rifle-butted in the face and illegally detained by police after he organised a protest against the inauguration of the Chinese-funded project. Photographs of his injuries, including a black eye and badly bruised back, have been published on social media. In his first interview with the foreign media since he was released on 30 December, Octavio Ortega, president of the Fundemur NGO, told the Guardian he was physically abused before he was put in jail. “My cellmates had to lift me up and help me so I could relieve myself,” he recalled. “The first night I couldn’t sleep because I couldn’t lie down. I spent the first four days in a bad way.” He said police demanded to know whether he was working for the CIA and that he only received the right medication for his hypertension and diabetes on the fifth day of his seven-day detention. The protest, detention and beatings highlight the tensions surrounding the canal – the biggest infrastructure project in the country’s history – which aims to rival Panama as a trade route across the central American isthmus. Ortega has been an outspoken opponent since the plan was approved by the parliament in 2012. He says the project was not adequately debated and will destroy the environment, particularly Lake Nicaragua, the largest body of freshwater in Central America. He has rallied thousands of landowners who are worried that their property will be expropriated by the government for the 174-mile channel and its subsidiary projects, including an airport, tourist resort and oil pipeline, on behalf of the company that will build and operate the project, Hong Kong-based HKND. In the most recent of half a dozen demonstrations, he joined a roadblock across the Pan-American Highway on 23 December to protest against the groundbreaking ceremony for the $40bn project the previous day. Ortega insisted the demonstration was peaceful, blocking the traffic every half hour to explain to drivers that “we don’t want to sell our properties, we have never put our properties up for sale, and we don’t want Lake Nicaragua to be destroyed”. But police cleared the roadblock – and another protest at El Tule – by force. At least 28 protesters were detained, including eight women and five minors. Ortega said six riot police attacked him and then he was taken to Managua’s judicial auxiliary directorate.    Other detainees confirmed a similar pattern. Danilo Lorío, a community leader from El Tule, told the Nicaraguan newspaper La Prensa that “they were beating us all the way on the bus”, although not in the prison cells. According to Nicaraguan law prisoners can only be held for 48 hours before being released or taken before judicial authorities, but Ortega was kept almost seven days in what he describes as a “four-by-four cell, with two concrete bunks, a hole to relieve yourself and water for just one hour in the morning and another hour at night”. He believes he was held longer so that his injuries would have time to heal and not look so bad. Police chief Aminta Granera has accused Ortega of threatening to blow up a petrol tanker during the protest and only failing because “fortunately his lighter did not work.” Ortega has not been charged and vehemently denies targeting the tanker, which was parked near the site of the protest. “How can you set fire to a tanker using a lighter? And anyway I don’t have one because I don’t smoke,” he said. With the project set to accelerate this year, the government and HKND now face the challenge of mollifying landowners and other critics. Wang Jing, the president of HKND, has promised compensation will be paid according to market principles in a fair and transparent way. “Nobody is going to touch an inch of anyone’s land unless there is an agreement and the owner is satisfied with the payment,” he said last week. Ortega, however, is unimpressed and undaunted. “We’re going to carry on with our peaceful, civic struggle for our rights … we want to continue channelling the response in a peaceful way so that this government understands there are laws to comply with and international treaties to respect,” he said.",profile/jonathanwatts,Jonathan,Watts
264,2015-01-02T14:51:36Z,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/02/being-a-metal-detectorist-has-its-moments-to-treasure,Being a detectorist has its moments to treasure,commentisfree,Opinion,The Guardian,"My fingers are still cracked from the cold of a clear Monday in the Kent countryside. Wrapped up in numerous layers, my friend James and I were out with thermos flasks, shovels and metal detectors to explore the past hidden beneath the frozen turf. Despite the news of a record-breaking find of 5,251 Anglo-Saxon coins, metal detecting is not a sexy hobby. The geeks of Mackenzie Crook’s recent sitcom, Detectorists, are all too close to real life – and yes, we dig up more ring pulls than ancient coins. But you can keep your parkour, your sourdough baking or your street dance – they’ve got nothing on the joys of going digging. Like all the best hobbies, detecting rests on a central streak of futility. For every interesting artefact you might find, there are a score of beeps that turn out to represent modern litter or a nugget of anonymous metal decayed beyond all recognition. Inevitably, you only find that out by digging a hole to reach your latest disappointment. That’s part of the fun. Each bit of rubbish that we search for and sweat to retrieve is an instant joke, or forgotten immediately as hope washes in while you backfill the divot dug to uncover it. Being out in a field somewhere in all weathers, powered by some sarnies and an endless optimism is an experience in itself – it teaches you patience and in a hectic world it’s refreshing to clear your mind of all but the occasional bleeps. The repeated rigmarole of digging a hole, scrabbling at the bottom, studying your find, then carefully refilling the hole and replacing the turf starts as a muddy form of scratch card and soon becomes a luck mantra in its own right. As with so many fringe pursuits, metal detecting takes place mostly in a private world. Barring the occasional headlines of a big or rare find, it exists in empty fields and crowded internet forums, where people share their finds, identify mystery objects posted by others or offer tips on different kit and favoured tactics. It has its own slang (shotties for the rusted caps of shotgun cartridges, the detectorist’s curse; hammies for the sought-after medieval hammered coins; grots for coinage rotten beyond identification), and its own community. Partners swiftly resign themselves to the fact that a corner of their house will likely play host to a supposedly interesting collection of odds and ends that you can never display to any guest who isn’t very keen on 17th-century lead trading tokens. Inevitably, we fall victim to being misunderstood. Headlines reporting “treasure hunters” finding this or that miss the mark – most detectorists see themselves as amateur archaeologists adding to the knowledge of the nation, not Del Boys on a get-rich-quick scheme. If you went out expecting to come home with a haul of precious metal each day, you’d swiftly give up. The misunderstanding isn’t helped by the persistence of the inevitable minority of sinful detectorists – who enjoy the perhaps over-dramatic nickname of nighthawks. Normally operating under cover of darkness, hence the name, they dig on people’s land without permission, trash registered archaeological sites and ignore the treasure laws for profit. They are rare but their impact is sufficient to make a sizeable number of landowners and professional archaeologists unduly suspicious of our hobby. As a result, the law-abiding lose out. For most of us, though, the true value of the things we find is human, not monetary. These are the relics not of famous kings and saints but of ordinary people. My finds tray (which lives discreetly on top of a bookcase, after some domestic negotiations) contains the belongings of individuals lost to history: the spur of a late medieval horseman, the small change of a Georgian farm labourer, the coin weights of a Stuart market trader. None of those original owners have a museum exhibition to their name, or even a name at all in the modern day. But the artefacts they dropped, the loss of which they no doubt cursed, bring me a jolt of excitement each time one is washed of the soil that concealed it for centuries. A glance at the website of the Portable Antiquities Scheme, where detectorists voluntarily register their day-to-day finds, shows that these glorious mundanities are the vast bulk of what we turn up. Of course, that’s not to say it wouldn’t be great to find a hoard. Paul Coleman, who unearthed those thousands of 10th and 11th-century coins, made the find of a lifetime. As his find undoubtedly falls under the Treasure Act, the coins will be valued by the British Museum and bought from him by the nation – he deserves congratulations, thanks for his addition to our knowledge of the Anglo-Saxons and the sizeable bounty that will no doubt come his way. But his experience is a rarity. For the bulk of his fellow detectorists, whom I’m sure he will rejoin in the fields when the itch starts again soon, such a find remains a fantasy. The day-to-day reality remains enough to drive us out into the fields, headphones on, spade slung behind us, flogging back and forth in search of just a tiny glimmer of past centuries. The cold-seared fingers with which I tap out this article are a minor irritation but I’m willing to overlook them. Because after a day of being battered by the December wind, and cutting through barely thawed turf, I finally brought a small, muddy nugget up from the ground. A quick clean revealed a glimmer of gold and a tiny, recognisable shape: he was missing his legs and worn by the years, but in my hand was a lead angel, cast and gilded likely in the medieval era. His right hand is raised, and he has what looks like a sword belt slung around his waist. And he makes it all worthwhile.",profile/mark-wallace,wallace,mark

But with the top two quarterbacks at the college level on the field, the game was also an opportunity to see if Marcus Mariota or Jameis Winston is more deserving to go in the NFL draft at No1. Oregon’s 59-20 destruction of the Seminoles left no doubt about which team deserves to play in the title game later this month, but did we get an equally clear result on whose name will be called first on 30 April at the draft by Tampa Bay?  Not so much.  Let’s break down the Rose Bowl performances by the last two Heisman Trophy winners.  The good Mariota’s stat line was outstanding: 26-for-36 passing, 400 yards of total offense, two passing touchdowns and another on the ground. He was flawlessly efficient in the second half as Oregon stretched a 25-20 lead to 59-20 in 12 minutes and 54 seconds – a time period that also saw social media explode into Schadenfreude-fueled delight over the downfall of Florida State. Oregon’s 59 points were a Rose Bowl record besting the 49 USC put up on Illinois in 2008. (Yes. Illinois were in a Rose Bowl as recently as 2008. No. Really. They were. I checked and double-checked.) Winston went 29-for-45 for 348 yards and a score and repeatedly made strong, accurate throws down the field while under heavy pressure. Several of his best throws were dropped by his receivers and his only interception was the result of a tip. At times it appeared he was one of the only players on his team who deserved to be playing on such a stage, something he’ll need to get used to if he’s drafted by the Buccaneers or Titans. The bad Despite the 39-point victory, Mariota easily had the two worst throws of the game. Early in the second quarter on 2nd-and-1, just 20 yards from the end zone, he threw across his body and delivered the ball directly into the hands of FSU’s Jalen Ramsey … but the sure interception was dropped. (Dropping the football would become a theme of the game for Florida State. Literary folks would refer to this play as “foreshadowing.”) Then before the half he threw an ugly pick at midfield that gave the Seminoles an opportunity to put points on the board … but FSU failed to capitalize and missed a long field goal try. But two bad passes out of 36 is nothing to be ashamed of, and let’s be glad Mariota saw any receivers to throw to at all. Imagine what the final score could have been if Oregon hadn’t dressed in uniforms the exact same color as the grass. They should probably go away from camouflage for the championship game. While Mariota had two bad plays, Winston had just one. One that was almost instantly captured in endless memes, Vines and gifs (good job, people of the internet!) and will forever be treasured by all those who proudly identify as Jameis Winston haters.     Down 39-20 late in the third quarter and facing a desperate 4th-and-5 at midfield, Winston dropped back, bought time, avoided the rush and then – to use a fancy football analysis term – just kind of fell over backwards. The ball flipped into the air, Oregon’s Tony Washington scooped it up and ran 58 yards – past a falling-over referee for bonus laughs – for a the game-clinching score.  “It kind of looked like [Winston] slipped on a banana, like in cartoons,” Oregon linebacker Torrodney Prevot mused after the game. Well said. You have to trust Oregon on their cartoon references. They’ve got a cartoon duck on their uniforms. The nitpicking   Again, Mariota’s stat line looks great. And it is. But Oregon’s offensive system doesn’t require him to make many, quote-unquote, “NFL throws”. In the first half he went 18-for-26, but 10-of-10 of that was on screen passes. His 56-yard TD pass to Darren Carrington in the second half included 40 yards after the catch and was off of a fake screen. Oregon’s system isn’t Mariota’s fault, but it still raises questions about his NFL readiness. Questions the Buccaneers will have to answer with tens of millions of dollars on the line. Questions people like me don’t have to answer, but get to criticize everyone for a few years from now if they come up with the wrong answers. (Blessed.) As for nitpicking Winston? There wasn’t much there to rip apart and overanalyze. He made plenty of NFL throws.  So instead let’s nitpick the social media response to his fumble. Still with the Lance Stephenson blowing meme? It’s 2015 now. It might be time for new material, internet. The postgame Mariota said all the right things after the game. This is code for: “He was fairly boring, which is what NFL teams want.” Good job, Marcus! And no one really cares much about Mariota’s off-the-field behavior anyway. Winston is the one with a … uh … “track record” there.  So how did he do at the Rose Bowl? Well, he didn’t do anything that would cause an NFL team who wants to draft him to not draft him. Florida State’s 26-game win streak ended in a blowout loss, but he was one of the Seminoles who stuck around on the field in the postgame to shake hands and wish Oregon well. He also comported himself well in his postgame interviews.  Maybe he’s maturing? Sure. Why not. He can throw a football very far and with accuracy. That will be enough for some NFL team. Of course, he also said this after the game: “It still ain’t over yet. We can go and play again, honest.” Huh? What? No. That’s confusing. As confusing as the question of whether Mariota or Winston will be the better NFL quarterback? No. But pretty confusing.",,,

The world of science fiction and fantasy saw diversity not only in the voices that found success, definitively turning the page on 2013’s chainmail binkinigate, but also in the means of production. While the metaphysical themes so vital to SF continued their conquest of the mainstream, it was the year when independent digital publishing changed the genre for good. One book dominated the awards in 2014: Anne Leckie’s Ancillary Justice. This debut novel evokes a future world in which gender is unimportant, a transformation Leckie renders by exclusively referring to characters with the pronoun “she”. Its unconventional take on gender politics helped Ancillary Justice make a clean sweep of the Hugo, Nebula, Clarke and BSFA awards, a rare and deserved achievement. Another writer who caught the mood of 2014 was Kameron Hurley, with her award-winning essay We Have Always Fought. In it she argued that women have been written out of stories of conflict, and that this “conscious choice to erase half the world” is a political act.  Stories tell us who we are. What we’re capable of. When we go out looking for stories we are, I think, in many ways going in search of ourselves, trying to find understanding of our lives, and the people around us. Stories, and language tell us what’s important.  Hurley’s The Mirror Empire is such an accomplished work of epic fantasy that, as reviewer Paul Weimar accurately noted, it seems to better represent the author’s true voice than her debut, God’s War. It sits alongside Leckie’s Ancillary Justice and Sofia Samatar’s A Stranger in Olondria at the forefront of a new wave of SF/F fiction, asking serious questions through the metaphors of fantastika. But the battle is not yet won, with a protest vote by conservative fans staged at the Hugo awards, and the World Fantasy awards overshadowed by a heated argument over the choice of HP Lovecraft as literary figurehead. Meanwhile, the popular energy of SF/F flourished in the burgeoning marketplace of independent publishing. Hugh Howey may be the best-known indie sci-fi author, but he is far from alone. AG Riddle’s Departure, Michael Bunker’s Pennsylvania, Sarah Fine’s Marked, Edward W Robertson’s Arawn trilogy – self-published titles in sci-fi and fantasy completely dominated the Amazon bestseller lists in these genres. Self-publishing is arguably the best route to mainstream success as well, as Andy Weir demostrated with The Martian – a self-published sensation that went on to become the mainstream SF novel of the year. The losers in this revolution seem to be debut writers published through mainstream genre imprints, who face the challenge of finding an audience without the freedom to manoeuvre in marketing and pricing enjoyed by independent authors. New writers come and go every year, but, with very few exceptions, independent authors seem to be the ones sticking around. David Mitchell’s The Bone Clocks was just one of the literary novels flavoured with sci-fi in 2014. Look at Michel Faber’s The Book of Strange New Things, Emily St John Mandel’s Station Eleven or Lev Grossman’s The Magician’s Land – when literary fiction hit the bestseller lists in 2014, it was often led by a sci-fi sensibility. The rich interplay of sci-fi and mainstream literature produced some of the best novels of 2014. Is Jeff VanderMeer’s Southern Reach trilogy a work of science fiction or mainstream fiction? The same question can be asked of William Gibson’s The Peripheral or, my personal pick for best debut novel of 2014, Monica Byrne’s The Girl in the Road.

Even though grand plans can backfire, even though we’re terrible at predicting what would make us happier, still we hunger for a fresh start. Well, I know when I’m beaten. You want resolutions? Here – based largely on the most persuasive studies and books I read last year – are three things to do immediately. Don’t waste time convincing yourself they don’t apply to you. Just do them. Do we have an understanding? Good. First, just start meditating already. You probably saw some of the eleventy-thousand studies in 2014 on how much difference a few minutes’ daily breath-following can make. Meditation could make you happier, more creative, less anxious, even less racist; it may conceivably ease your arthritis, slow Alzheimer’s, boost your learning ability and reduce cold symptoms. (Spiritual types might dispute that all this is the “point” of meditation, but they’re nice side-effects.) You don’t have time? Try five minutes a day. You “can’t meditate”? Sorry, nope: spending those minutes getting distracted still counts; indeed, noticing when you’re distracted is the essence of it. You’re too emotionally attached to your atheism or rationalism to get involved in something that smacks of new agery? Look, over here: this is me not caring. There are instructions at spiritrock.org. And you don’t need a cushion. Use a chair. You probably own a chair. Second: select something to stop doing this year. I don’t mean bad habits, such as injecting heroin or picking your nose; I mean something worthwhile, but that, if you’re honest, you don’t have time for. In our hyperbusy era, there’s an infinite number of potential things to do: emails to read, groups to join, ways to become a better person, parent, employee. Yet still we proceed as if “getting everything done” might be feasible. It isn’t; the wiser plan is to get more strategic about what you abandon. (One technique: list your 10 most important roles in life, rank them, then resign from at least the bottom two.) Quit your book group; stop struggling to make dates with that hard-to-pin-down friend; accept you’ll never be a good cook. Not because those things are bad; because it’s the only way to do other things well. Third, and sorry to get all Thought For The Day on you, but: resolve to cut everyone a massive amount of slack, including yourself. That’s the overarching conclusion of social psychology: we’re all staggeringly imperfect organisms, prone to making bad decisions when stress, busyness or poverty robs us of “cognitive bandwidth”. We habitually excuse our own bad behaviour as the result of special circumstances, while blaming others’ misdemeanours on deep-down nastiness. Or we torment ourselves with how much more accomplished everyone else is, when really it’s just that we lack access to their inner monologues of self-doubt. So: ease up. Except when it comes to these three resolutions, which you must now implement fully.

Whether you’re pro or con boils down to this: over 30, “no food on Earth is worth waiting in line for unless I’m staring starvation in the face”; under 30, “I might get lucky in the queue.” There are no prizes for guessing which camp I’m in as I trudge disconsolately towards London’s hottest new opening, the aptly-named Smoking Goat. We take one look at the seething mass of skinny-jeaned humanity jostling for a handful of seats in this loud, dark dive bar and think, bugger this for a lark. Then I remember something: another new place a stagger away is deliberately, archly “reservations only”. A phone call later and we’re on our way. There’s nothing to announce Old Tom & English’s presence, other than a vast, gleaming brass doorbell – so speakeasy. But I’m confused: where’s the restaurant? This subterranean joint, designed by Lee Broom (the man responsible for the semi-iconic Crystal Bulb), looks like a bar. We eat cockle popcorn with salt and vinegar: impossible to dislike, but you could probably deep-fry fingernails, douse ’em in salt and vinegar and they’d go nicely with a cocktail. And kale and burnt apple salad, the fruit bullied to invisibility by the brassica. And smoked confit guinea fowl, its skin papery and crisp, its flesh tender and smoky; anchovy mayo is perhaps an umami blast too far. There are scallops, complete with coral, courgette puree and cubelets of black pudding – a forgettable, vanilla dish. Most of all, though, there are martinis. Bone-dry icy martinis, as good as you’ll get, the silver bullets of legend. We have three each. With its witty, 20th-century-modern feel, Old Tom & English (the name references a classic gin, apparently) is a seductive hangout. I’m not sure why it’s so keen to insist it’s a restaurant when really it’s a fine addition to Soho’s canon of louche drinking dens. It just serves better bar snacks. Around 10pm, martini wisdom suddenly dictates there might be no queue at Smoking Goat, so off we barrel. The martinis are right, too: we get a table instantly. You might think it’s reprehensible to review after several strong ones, but you’d be wrong: Smoking Goat serves the ultimate pisshead food, bashing its way through the booze with a mighty mallet of heat and fat, spice and salt and smoke. There’s nothing subtle, nothing requiring a finely-tuned palate. The vinyl soundtrack is grungy and loud, as are the hooting, cocktail-glugging gals propping up the bar. I may or may not be imagining the ossified puffer fish dangling from the ceiling. The menu is super-brief, so we have most of it apart from whole crab, which might be beyond our current motor skills. We’re soon up to our elbows in vast slabs of meat: pork belly fragrant with five spice, and lamb ribs fresh from the sparking wood-fired barbecue, tearing off strips with greasy fingers and slurping them through sauces sharp with lime and fish sauce and belligerent with vicious little scuds. What a blast. Som tam is indifferent, the papaya needing to be more finely shredded and muddled properly to marry the sour-sweet-fiery flavours, but sticky rice, delivered in little plastic bags, is all cloy and bite, and perfect for sponging up sticky juices. It’s mostly more like northern Thai street food than anything you’d find in the restaurants of Bangkok, but fish sauce chicken wings point to Portland’s food hero Andy Ricker and his Pok Pok, and owe more to Vietnam than to Thailand. They’re very similar to Ricker’s, with their crackly, caramelised exterior (crisp from rice flour and pungent with garlic and fish sauce), and steaming, succulent, salty flesh. We get into woozy conversation with the cool young guys at the next table; one turns out to be a chef at Som Saa, London’s other rock’n’roll Thai BBQ. They leave shortly afterwards, probably grossed out by our grins, Shane McGowan-esque thanks to brutally adherent chunks of carbonised lamb fat. The food at Smoking Goat isn’t finger-licking good, it’s fist-and-wrist-and-possibly-elbow-and-knee-licking good. So here’s my advice for dealing with the whole reservations minefield: have two dinners.

We have undoubtedly seen that – and more. Leading companies are pushing ahead with green investments and ambitious emissions cuts, and are setting long-term targets because they recognise that it makes business sense.  In turn, policymakers have also made historic progress, including the European Union, China and the US, which all announced long-term climate targets beyond 2020. This helped spur momentum for the Lima Call for Climate Action, the accord agreed by over 190 governments in December which marked the first time all countries have agreed to net-zero emissions by 2050. There is, however, only so much carbon we can emit before we dramatically increase our chances of pushing temperatures above 2C, the limit agreed by governments and climate scientists. To stay within that budget, the question remains if the long-term targets – to be announced by all governments next year – will be enough to achieve carbon neutrality by mid-century. Companies too will have to join this race to set bold climate targets in 2015. While emissions targets are increasingly becoming the norm for successful businesses, the reality is that too few are aligning these targets with the requirements of climate science. That is beginning to change. A small handful of businesses such as Autodesk, BT and Mars are already attempting to incorporate climate science into their goal-setting strategies. Now some 30 businesses, including L’Oréal, Sodexo and Unilever, have committed, through CDP, to set emissions reduction targets that are aligned with limiting global temperatures to below 2C. The changing economic landscape, especially in the energy field, will spur more company action in 2015. In September, research from investment firm Lazard found that large wind farms and solar plants were now cost-competitive with gas-fired power in parts of the US, even without subsidy. In a year that is set to be the hottest on record, this comes as a much-needed tipping point to drive further innovation and investment. Forward-looking companies are already starting to pick up and capitalise on the opportunities from renewables. US electric utility firm NRG announced in November it would be cutting emissions by 90% by 2050, due in part to the opportunities to supply energy to other businesses looking to reduce their emissions. In December, Germany’s largest utility firm E.ON said it would focus on renewables over coal and gas because of the “dramatically altered global energy markets.” How many more will follow suit in 2015? Investors are also increasing their scrutiny of climate and environmental risks. The Portfolio Decarbonization Coalition, launched in September, is a group of investment institutions which asks investors to commit to reducing the carbon footprint of $100bn (£64.3bn) of investment by December 2015. Building on last year, the global business community will need to continue to push policymakers to legislate a carbon price to reflect the true cost of doing business. Smart companies, including Dow Chemical Company, Mars and Walt Disney, are already factoring a price on their carbon emissions into investment decisions. The growing expectation from companies that there will be a price on carbon is another sign that we are moving closer to a low-carbon future. While some of this hinges on the success of the planned global climate deal in Paris next year, governments have a critical responsibility to ensure their contributions are long-term and in line with the science. If companies want to succeed in this future, they too must ratchet up their ambition and start playing the long game on climate action. Paul Simpson is chief executive officer of CDP.

It is six years, after all, since 2009, the year in which the comedian’s blossoming career and reputation took an abrupt and savage hit, thanks to his unloved eponymous sketch show with Gavin & Stacey co-star Mathew Horne (“puerile and excruciating”, according to the New Statesman), a critically mauled movie, Lesbian Vampire Killers (“a witless mess”, said the Telegraph), and a calamitous performance hosting the Brit awards with Horne, which even Corden has acknowledged was “shit, because of ego”. And yet he still finds himself asked repeatedly about the period he himself called “quite a dark time in my life”, which is evidently losing its charm. As he told one recent interviewer: “We’re four minutes into this interview and we’re talking about things that haven’t worked, and I don’t think that would be the case [with other performers].” His irritation may be understandable given what Corden has gone on to achieve since. A third and final series of Gavin & Stacey claimed further awards for Corden and his co-writer Ruth Jones. His leading role in One Chance, a film about Britain’s Got Talent winner Paul Potts, was well received. His performance in Sir Nicholas Hytner’s production of One Man, Two Guvnors for the National Theatre, a role conceived especially for Corden, won ecstatic reviews in London and Broadway and won him, stunningly, the Tony award for best actor, beating a shortlist that included Philip Seymour Hoffman, Frank Langella and James Earl Jones. Just last month, the second series of The Wrong Mans, an action-comedy co-written by and starring Corden, secured the kind of reviews for which performers wait a lifetime (“Just ridiculously good”, said the Daily Mail. “I’m not ashamed to say I stood and clapped at the end, on my own in a quiet room,” wrote the Guardian’s Julia Raeside.”) All that, it transpires, is just the beginning. It has already been a notable 2015 for Corden, now 36, who was “thrilled, overwhelmed and honoured” to be awarded an OBE in the New Year honours list for services to drama. Next week sees the release of Into the Woods, Disney’s movie version of the Stephen Sondheim musical, in which Corden plays a leading role. And in March, in arguably the biggest challenge of them all, the comedian will move with his young family to Los Angeles to take over hosting The Late Late Show on CBS, one of the leading programmes in America’s ultra-competitive late night TV market. The late night shows are a huge cultural institution and, says the US TV writer Brian Moylan, “usually when someone is installed in one of these positions, they have it for life. It’s more like a knighthood than a job. That’s why it’s a big deal he got it … to give this guy that no one had ever heard of a late night TV show seemed a little bit crazy.” It is a “frightening” prospect for the actor, admits the producer and director Ben Winston, who is Corden’s best friend and close collaborator, and who will move with him to the US to become executive producer of the Late Late Show. So why, after his remarkable stage success, and with another hit sitcom under his belt and his movie career taking off, did Corden want to take such a huge risk with an audience that has no idea who he is? “It wasn’t a quick decision,” says Winston, “but James is hugely ambitious and full of ideas and a hard worker, and he doesn’t like to do things that are easy and comfortable. I think he saw the CBS show as a real challenge for him. “Apart from the Broadway circle and Into the Woods, he’s not known in America. And here he can speak every night into each American household and show what he can do as an interviewer and a comedian and a singer and an actor – whatever he wants to be.” The pair met in the early noughties on the set of the Channel 4 drama Teachers, in which Corden had a small part and Winston, straight out of school, was a runner. They immediately hit it off because “I think we saw in each other huge ambition”, says Winston. “We would spend hours talking about the kind of TV we wanted to make and what we wanted to do with our careers and our lives.” In 2009, after Corden had won plaudits at the National, on Broadway and later on film for his role in Alan Bennett’s The History Boys, and become wildly famous overnight thanks to Gavin & Stacey, the pair worked together for the first time in a short film for Comic Relief, directed by Winston, in which Corden’s sitcom character Smithy encounters the England football team. It led to an incident that the director says sums up his friend. Though they had secured the agreement of players including David Beckham, John Terry and Ashley Cole to appear in the film, the then manager, Fabio Capello, insisted that the young director had 20 minutes to film the sketch, “not one minute more”. “So we got everyone lined up, we got the England players in, they take ages to sit down, and I’m thinking, you’re eating into my 20 minutes, and I call action, and James says: ‘Whoah, whoah, Ben, I need a minute with you, sorry.’ “I take off my headset, I run over to him, he puts me in a corner and he just whispers, ‘I’m Jeremy from Teachers, you’re the runner from Teachers, and we’ve got the whole of the England team waiting for us. I just thought we should take a minute.’ I just love that about James. He doesn’t take anything for granted, he will stop and go: ‘This is an amazing thing.’” Corden was born in 1978 and grew up in Buckinghamshire, the second of three children of an RAF bandsman turned Christian book salesman father and social worker mother. His earliest memories, as described in his aptly-titled 2011 autobiography “May I Have Your Attention, Please?”, were of craving the rush of approval that came from laughter and applause, something he later called “a lust for people to pay me attention”. It has, he has acknowledged, occasionally become a dark compulsion. He scraped through school with little interest in anything but drama (“I was always the kid who thought it was a good idea to set off the fire alarm”), leaving with two GCSEs for a role in the chorus in a West End production. That led to TV parts here and there and, eventually, the History Boys. It was Bennett, frequently present at rehearsals, who first encouraged Corden to write (“People had told me to think about writing before,” the actor has said, “but there’s a big difference between your Aunty Marian telling you that you could be a funny writer and Alan Bennett”). The playwright’s one tip: “Be warm.” If following Bennett’s advice helped catapult its co-writer to celebrity – Gavin and Stacey, though bitingly funny, was sweet and uncynical at heart – as the programme became more famous, Corden struggled to emulate its easy likeability in his personal life. The actor’s career missteps weren’t the only reason his reputation soured, thanks to a period of boorish, celebrity-obsessed behaviour and a number of unpleasant award ceremony appearances. Corden may have been feted as a performer, but he remains far from universally loved, and the social media reaction to his OBE award demonstrated that there are many who have never forgiven him for the charmless years of tabloid ubiquity. To judge anyone by their Twitter critics is unjust, says Winston, “and with 4.5 million followers I would say he is not doing too badly on social media”. But there is no question that to make a success of his new US role, Corden will have to project the warmth and likeability that Bennett advocated, and which he can undoubtedly show, as well as his enormous comedic talent. It is not the only challenge he faces, says Moylan. All of the late night shows have seen declining audiences for years, with young people increasingly relying on viral clips online to catch up with the best content. Craig Ferguson, another Brit whom Corden will replace, had a small but devoted audience, says Moylan, “but he never did anything that went viral or really made a huge contribution to the cultural conversation. Unless Corden can figure out a way to be a hit on the internet, I’m afraid he’s going to suffer the same fate.” In that context, a huge Twitter following, friendly or hostile, certainly helps. Winston is confident his friend, who married former charity worker Julia Carey in 2012 and is now father to a young son and baby daughter, has reached a point in his life where “he’s ready to let his work do the talking”. The CBS show may be nerve-wracking, he says, but apart from everything else it is a steady job that will allow Corden, now five stone lighter than at his peak, to spend time with his family. “For the next few years he has something he can get his teeth into, to be the multifaceted performer that I know he can be, and at the same time to go home to his young family every night. And that’s probably a lovely thing for him to think about.” The all-rounder Born 22 August 1978 Career Achieved enormous TV success in 2007 as co-writer and star of Gavin & Stacey, leading to acclaimed performances at the National Theatre and on Broadway in One Man, Two Guvnors.

She allegedly fell headfirst from the revolving ride, which involves seats ascending 25ft into the air and tilting outwards. According to her lawsuit, a mix of sleet and snow contributed to her fall, but Brown also claims that inadequate safety measures were in place, as the ride lacked locking restraint mechanisms. Brown claims she has been left with permanent brain impairments as a result. She also suffered spine and neck injuries, torn ligaments and a broken jaw, according to the suit.

The club is just above the bottom four, though two wins in the past three games have at least provided a seven-point buffer. A certain level of stoicism has usually been part of the deal for Southport supporters, however – even when the club held league status crowds were small and times generally hard. Southport were the last club to be voted out of the Football League, making way for Wigan Athletic by the re-election process in 1978. Wigan were by no means certain to gain acceptance, because their previous incarnation of Wigan Borough had resigned from the league in 1931 with their applications for re-entry were resisted for years, but Southport presented such a feeble case – three-figure crowds, dilapidated ground, almost permanent residence at or near the bottom of the table – that they lost a narrow vote. “I actually went along to the Cafe Royal on the day, and it was the only occasion when football reduced me to tears,” Urwin says. “The W-word was a dirty one in our house for a long time after that, although I must admit Wigan took their chance and made something out of it. I was as pleased as everyone else to see them win the FA Cup. In all honesty, even in my wildest dreams I don’t think I could ever envisage Southport doing that, but it is all about having money behind you. Wigan ended up with a chairman who pumped money into the club, and that is what you need to go up through the divisions. Fleetwood have just done the same. I can remember not too long ago when they were two or three divisions below us, now they are in League One and going well. That is wholly down to Andy Pilley and the money he has put into the club, and you do wonder what might happen were he to change his mind and walk away, but that is a risk clubs have to take if they want to get ahead.” What comes around goes around and if they are not careful Wigan could find themselves in the same division as Fleetwood next season. Before Dave Whelan decided to help out his hometown club in the mid-80s Wigan were finding out what Southport already knew, that most of the football allegiances in the north-west are long-established and tough to break. “We obviously live in the shadow of Liverpool and Everton, but at one point a few seasons ago there were seven Premier League clubs on our doorstep,” Urwin points out. “Some of them were offering cheap deals on tickets as well, so there is all that football on offer before you consider Preston, Morecambe or Blackpool, also handy and also above us. Basically we have to hope people will consider supporting two clubs, we don’t mind sharing spectators with some of the bigger teams. I just don’t think we will ever get back into the league on that basis, unless a backer comes along. It would be nice to get back into the league; when it’s what you have been brought up on you don’t feel happy about letting it go, though at least we have found a level at the moment where we can look forward with a bit of optimism. Towards the end of our time in the league, and for a few years afterwards when the club seemed to be dying every day, it was hard to see us making any progress at all.”",profile/paulwilson,Paul,Wilson
276,2015-01-02T15:23:35Z,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jan/02/leicester-tom-youngs-bath-salary-cap,Leicester’s Tom Youngs expects battle with Bath that shows why salary cap fits,sport,Sport,The Guardian,"Leicester against Bath has over the years been one of the highlights of the European rugby calendar. It lost a pinch of its piquancy a decade ago as the West Country club failed to make the move from amateurism to professionalism as seamlessly as their rivals, but a sell-out crowd at Welford Road on Sunday is testimony to its enduring appeal at a time when it is the Tigers who are adrift of the top four. As the debate over the salary cap enters another round, Leicester and Bath are at opposite ends of the argument. The latter, losing some £3m a year and bogged down in years of talks over their Recreation Ground, have used the largesse of their multimillion-pound owner Bruce Craig to turn them into title contenders while the Tigers, the best supported club in England, record a profit every year and live within their means. “I agree with the salary cap,” said Leicester’s England hooker, Tom Youngs. “It has helped make the Premiership the outstanding tournament it is and is good for the game. It needs to keep increasing so that clubs can grow their squads and have more players to call on during what is a long season to help offset injuries, but it has to stay. “The majority of matches in the league are tight, nail-biting affairs and that is because the best players are not concentrated in a few clubs but spread around. Crowds are packing our grounds and everyone looks forward to the game at the end of the week. I really enjoy being part of it and you have to be careful what you wish for: when you look at France it is hard to keep up with all the comings and goings. The cap gives us stability in England.” Leicester have more than a continued tilt at the top four to plan on Sunday: in the first match between the sides last September, they were thrashed in Bath and failed to score a point for only the second time in a Premiership match. Youngs was a substitute that afternoon and had been on the field only a few minutes when he suffered a shoulder injury that was to keep him out of action for two months and rule him out of England’s autumn international series. “They gave us a right thumping and we have not forgotten,” said Youngs. “They are playing well, confident through winning games comfortably. It is a tight race for the top four positions with eight clubs involved: Northampton, Bath and Saracens have established a bit of a lead, but there is a long way to go and this is the stage of the season when the ability to grind out results is crucial. “We know what it takes to finish in the top four and I hope that stands us in good stead in the coming months. We keep playing to the end, as we showed last weekend at Sale when we came from 15 points down to secure a bonus-point win. If we had lost, we would have slumped to eighth in the table. In such a tight league, you have to battle for every point: we scored a late try to secure a draw at home to Bath last season. It can be the difference between finishing in the top four or not and while we are not happy about where we are in the league, we had a huge injury list earlier in the season and it told.” Youngs will be up against one of his rivals for the England hooker’s jersey, Rob Webber, at a time when the future of the first choice in the position in November, Dylan Hartley, is dividing opinion following the red card he received last month playing for Northampton against Leicester when he elbowed the centre Matt Smith in the face. He was subsequently banned for three weeks. “The red card happened and everyone has to move on,” said Youngs. “Stuart Lancaster [the England head coach] will review everything and take it from there. Dylan is a friend of mine and I hope it does not affect his international career. Things happen in matches between Leicester and Northampton, as I should know after being flattened by a punch during the play-off semi-final at Franklin’s Gardens last May. They are big occasions, tough for referees, and you need to be on edge. As professional players, we have the job of keeping a lid on things, but there will be times when it blows off. The east Midlands derby is just unlike any other game. “Rob has played well for Bath and England this season and I want to be a part of the Six Nations having missed out in the autumn. The World Cup is a carrot, but there is a long way to go before then and we cannot look beyond next month’s opener in Cardiff, a nice start in what will be the toughest of games; it is the sort of place where you need to make a point. I do not think the result will mean anything come the World Cup because that will be a different time and place, but after what happened to us at the Millennium Stadium two years ago we want to show how much we have improved as a team.

Most of the top 10 shows were down on last year, BBC1’s Doctor Who suffering the most spectacular drop, down nearly 3 million viewers. Mrs Brown’s Boys had a total audience of 9.7 million viewers, a 34.2% share of the audience, in the consolidated figures which include people who recorded the programme and watched it in the seven days after transmission. But while the bawdy sitcom created by Brendan O’Carroll added another 2.1 million viewers when the so-called “timeshifted” audience is taken into account, only an estimated 200,000 viewers recorded the Queen’s annual message and watched it later. So while Mrs Brown’s Boys leapfrogged the Queen into the top spot, reclaiming the number one position it had on Christmas Day 2013, the monarch, who had the biggest overnight audience, slipped to seventh place in the Christmas Day top 10. Doctor Who suffered the biggest year on year decline to 8.3 million, its 2013 audience of 11.1 million boosted by anticipation around Matt Smith’s regeneration into Peter Capaldi as the doctor. Mrs Brown’s Boys was down 1.8 million viewers on 2013, as was ITV’s Coronation Street, with Downton Abbey shedding 1.7 million viewers year on year. But some shows added viewers, including BBC1’s Call the Midwife and Strictly Come Dancing, both up 200,000 viewers on 2013. Reflecting the changing way in which we watch TV, three programmes boosted their audience by more than 2 million viewers in the seven days after the original broadcast – Mrs Brown’s Boys, Call The Midwife and Strictly Come Dancing, which both jumped ahead of EastEnders in the consolidated top 10. Soaps proved less popular to watch after the original broadcast, with EastEnders watched by 1.2 million viewers in the subsequent seven days. The BBC dominated the consolidated figures, taking the top six places. With the Queen’s message, which was broadcast by both the BBC and ITV, in seventh place, the rest of the top 10 was made up by ITV shows Coronation Street, Downton Abbey and Emmerdale. However, even the consolidated viewing figures do not give the complete figure, not including on-demand viewing on devices such as the BBC’s iPlayer, which is expected to publish festive viewing figures next week.

Deborah Bone had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a type of bone marrow cancer, and died on 30 December – hours after receiving an honour for her services to children and young people. Bone, who lived in Letchworth in Hertfordshire, with her husband and two daughters, developed ways to help young people cope with high stress and anxiety, including a visual resource dubbed Brainbox and the award-winning Bright Stars programme used in primary schools across her home county. Born in Sheffield, Bone’s mother is close friends with the mother of Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker – an association that led to her being named in Disco 2000 in the lyric: “Well we were born within one hour of each other. Our mothers said we could be sister and brother. Your name is Deborah. Deborah. It never suited ya.”   Pulp’s Disco 2000 namechecks Deborah Bone  Cocker is said to have sung the 1995 hit at Bone’s 50th birthday celebrations last year. Her death was announced in a post on her blog, My Myeloma Journey, on New Year’s Day by Bone’s husband, Colin, and their daughters, Pollyanna and Jemima. They said: “We are sorry to let you know that after a brave fight, Deborah passed away on December 30th, peacefully at home. She loved life and fought to the end. “Deborah was a truly inspirational woman, always putting other people before herself. She worked tirelessly to improve the lives of those around her and it is with great pride we can tell you that in the New Year’s honours list 2015 she received an MBE for her services to children’s mental health. “She leaves behind a loving family – her two beautiful daughters, grandson and husband who all miss her greatly and will continue to follow in her footsteps. “As a family, we would like to thank you all for the support and kind wishes. We will be creating a book of our Mummy’s life and memories. Please could you share any photographs, notes or thoughts with us so together we can forever honour her memory.” The family asked for donations to the young people’s mental health charity Young Minds as a tribute to Bone’s life and work.",profile/josh-halliday,Josh ,Halliday
279,2015-01-02T15:33:46Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/02/tony-pulis-west-brom-keep-up-two-weeks,Tony Pulis: ‘Give me two weeks and I’ll know if I can keep West Brom up’,football,Football,The Guardian,"Tony Pulis has told West Bromwich Albion it will take him at least two weeks before he discovers whether he can keep the club in the Premier League. Last season’s saviour of Crystal Palace takes charge of the team for the first time against Gateshead in the FA Cup on Saturday, having been a spectator in the stands as West Brom drew 1-1 at West Ham in the league on Thursday, and he promised the fans he would not underestimate the non-league side. “The FA Cup means a lot to me as a person,” he said. “I recognise that supporters want to do well at their clubs and we’ll try and win the game tomorrow. “The team we’ll put out will be a strong team and it’s a team that’s been picked to win a game of football, irrespective of who we are playing.” Following the Gateshead match, West Brom take on fellow strugglers Hull City at home, then Everton away in the next fortnight, by which time Pulis will have a clearer idea of the task that lies before him. “My record is by the by now – there’s everybody trying to stay up in the Premiership and just because I’ve walked through the door doesn’t mean the club’s going to stay up,” he said. Asked whether he could save a side who are one point above the teams in the relegation zone, he said: “You need to give me a couple of weeks and then I’ll give you an answer. I’m under no illusions it’s going to be really difficult.” Key to his chances of success will be his relationship with the chairman Jeremy Peace who appointed him on a two-and-a-half-year deal after sacking Alan Irvine. Pulis came on board after having insisted on having the final say on transfer policy, a sticking point at Crystal Palace where he fell out with Steve Parish and then quit two days before the start of the season. It makes him West Brom’s fourth manager in little more than a year after Irvine, Pepe Mel and Steve Clarke but he stressed he had enjoyed a productive relationship with the chairman Peter Coates at Stoke City and did not anticipate any problems at The Hawthorns. “I think the most important thing at a club is that everybody works together, irrespective of decision making,” he said. “Someone asked me if I minded being called head coach. You can call me head bottlewasher if you want, it doesn’t make a blind bit of difference. As long as I know there are specific responsibilities I’m in charge of then that’s not a problem. “Having spoken to the chairman, everyone understands the position we’re in, everybody understands what we have to try to do and everybody understands we have to be together to make sure the club stays up. “There’s a lot of work top be done to do that and we need the support of everybody. I’ve been here quite a few times and this place rocks when the support is really behind the team and we need to get that going again, desperately.” Pulis managed Stoke from 2006-13 before joining Palace and guided them to 11th place in the top flight in his one season in charge.",profile/guardian-sport,sport,guardian
280,2015-01-02T15:37:58Z,https://www.theguardian.com/science/grrlscientist/2015/jan/02/new-books-party-the-british-ecological-society-edition,New books party: the British Ecological Society edition,science,Science,The Guardian,"I was most honoured to be invited to attend the British Ecological Society’s annual meeting, jointly held with the French Ecological Society, in Lille, France this past December. Whilst there, I managed to attract quite a flock of scholarly books into my bag, books that now are nestled on my desk next to my keyboard.  Many of these are intended to be textbooks or supplemental readings for university students and graduate students, but they are so well-written that I think interested non-specialists would also enjoy reading them. Glancing through this list, you will notice there’s quite a few books here, and they’re from a wide range of topics. For this reason, I briefly share why I chose each particular title, hoping this information may be useful to you.     . Composite: Oxford University Press   Ecological Speciation by Patrik Nosil [304 pages, Oxford University Press, 2012; Guardian bookshop; Amazon UK hardcover/paperback/kindle UK; Amazon US hardcover/paperback/kindle US] Publisher’s synopsis: The origin of biological diversity, via the formation of new species, can be inextricably linked to adaptation to the ecological environment. Specifically, ecological processes are central to the formation of new species when barriers to gene flow (reproductive isolation) evolve between populations as a result of ecologically-based divergent natural selection. This process of ‘ecological speciation’ has seen a large body of particularly focused research in the last 10-15 years, and a review and synthesis of the theoretical and empirical literature is now timely.  The book begins by clarifying what ecological speciation is, its alternatives, and the predictions that can be used to test for it. It then reviews the three components of ecological speciation and discusses the geography and genomic basis of the process. A final chapter highlights future research directions, describing the approaches and experiments which might be used to conduct that future work. The ecological and genetic literature is integrated throughout the text with the goal of shedding new insight into the speciation process, particularly when the empirical data is then further integrated with theory. My first impression: Since I am a scientist whose primary research interests lie in developing a better understanding the process of speciation, this was a book that I simply had to get. I was especially attracted by the breadth of topics covered -- genetics, molecular biology and genomics, in particular. Further, since I often read about ecology and ethology (animal behaviour) and how these impinge upon and drive evolution, this book -- which actually is a clearly-written review of the literature -- is a valuable addition to my collection.    . Photograph: Oxford University Press   Avian Urban Ecology: Behavioural and Physiological Adaptations by Diego Gil and Henrik Brumm [248 pages, Oxford University Press, 2013; Guardian bookshop; Amazon UK hardcover/paperback/kindle UK; Amazon US hardcover/paperback/kindle US] Publisher’s synopsis: As natural habitat continues to be lost and the world steadily becomes more urbanized, biologists are increasingly studying the effect this has on wildlife. Birds are particularly good model systems since their life history, behaviour, and physiology are especially influenced by directly measurable environmental factors such as light and sound pollution. It is therefore relatively easy to compare urban individuals and populations with their rural counterparts. This accessible text focuses on the behavioural and physiological mechanisms which facilitate adaptation and on the evolutionary process that ensues. It discusses topics such as acoustics, reproductive cues, disease, and artificial feeding, and includes a series of case studies illustrating cutting edge research on these areas.  Avian Urban Ecology is suitable for professional avian biologists and ornithologists as well as graduate students of avian ecology, evolution, and conservation. It will also be of relevance and use to a more general audience of urban ecologists and conservation biologists. My first impression: Reading John Marzluff’s recent book, Welcome to Subirdia, has made me acutely conscious of the many birds and other animals that live in large cities. I guess you could say this is a new obsession of mine. A brief skim through this book made me realise it would be a lovely scholarly companion volume to Professor Marzluff’s popular non-specialist title.    . Illustration: Oxford University Press   An Unnatural History of Emerging Infections by Ron Barrett and George Armelagos [160 pages, Oxford University Press, 2014; Guardian bookshop; Amazon UK hardcover/kindle UK; Amazon US hardcover/kindle US] Publisher’s synopsis: This book traces the social and environmental determinants of human infectious diseases from the Neolithic to the present day. Despite recent high profile discoveries of new pathogens, the major determinants of these emerging infections are ancient and recurring. These include changing modes of subsistence, shifting populations, environmental disruptions, and social inequalities. The recent labeling of the term “re-emerging infections” reflects a re-emergence, not so much of the diseases themselves, but rather a re-emerging awareness in affluent societies of long-standing problems that were previously ignored.  An Unnatural History of Emerging Infections illustrates these recurring problems and determinants through an examination of three major epidemiological transitions. The First Transition occurred with the Agricultural Revolution beginning 10,000 years ago, bringing a rise in acute infections as the main cause of human mortality. The Second Transition first began with the Industrial Revolution; it saw a decline in infectious disease mortality and an increase in chronic diseases among wealthier nations, but less so in poorer societies. These culminated in today’s “worst of both worlds syndrome” in which globalization has combined with the challenges of the First and Second Transitions to produce a Third Transition, characterized by a confluence of acute and chronic disease patterns within a single global disease ecology.  This accessible text is suitable for advanced undergraduate and graduate level students and researchers in the fields of epidemiology, disease ecology, anthropology, health sciences, and the history of medicine. It will also be of relevance and use to undergraduate students interested in the history and social dynamics of infectious diseases. My first impression: Having both a university degree and work experience in microbiology, I’ve always been keenly interested in emerging infections. I even designed a university lecture and laboratory course that explored this topic, so I am always reading books about this topic. In this deceptively thin book, the authors explore the complex relationships between human history and behaviour and patterns of disease. The writing is clear and engaging, making this an essential, thought-provoking book for specialists and non-specialists alike.    . Illustration: Cambridge University Press   Successful Scientific Writing: A Step-by-Step Guide for the Biological and Medical Sciences (4th edition) by Janice R. Matthews and Robert W. Matthews [304 pages, Cambridge University Press; 2014; Guardian bookshop; Amazon UK paperback; Amazon US paperback/kindle US] Publisher’s synopsis: Thoroughly revised and updated, the new edition of this acclaimed and best-selling guide offers a rich blend of practical advice and real-life examples. The authors draw on fifty years of experience, providing detailed step-by-step guidance designed to help students and researchers write and present scientific manuscripts more successfully through knowledge, practice, and an efficient approach. Retaining the user-friendly style of the previous editions, this fourth edition has been broadened to include detailed information relevant to today’s digital world. It covers all aspects of the writing process, from first drafts, literature retrieval, and authorship to final drafts and electronic publication. A new section provides extensive coverage of ethical issues, from plagiarism and dual publication to honesty in reporting statistics. Both the text and 30 hands-on exercises include abundant examples applicable to a variety of writing contexts, making this a powerful tool for researchers and students across a range of disciplines. My first impression: I admit that I am a sucker for writing books, so of course, I had to get this newest edition. It’s almost twice as thick as my well-worn old copy -- and that was a very useful and instructive book that relocated with me to several countries. But this book is even better because, as it walks the reader through the steps necessary to produce strong writing, it includes lots of information about online writing, ethics and (perhaps most timely of all), plagiarism. Absolutely essential for everyone who writes about science or medicine.    . Illustration: Cambridge University Press   Scientific Method in Brief by Hugh G. Gauch Jr [303 pages, Cambridge University Press, 2012; Guardian bookshop; Amazon UK paperback/kindle UK; Amazon US paperback/kindle US] Publisher’s synopsis: The fundamental principles of the scientific method are essential for enhancing perspective, increasing productivity, and stimulating innovation. These principles include deductive and inductive logic, probability, parsimony and hypothesis testing, as well as science’s presuppositions, limitations, ethics and bold claims of rationality and truth. The examples and case studies drawn upon in this book span the physical, biological and social sciences; include applications in agriculture, engineering and medicine; and also explore science’s interrelationships with disciplines in the humanities such as philosophy and law. Informed by position papers on science from the American Association for the Advancement of Science, National Academy of Sciences and National Science Foundation, this book aligns with a distinctively mainstream vision of science. It is an ideal resource for anyone undertaking a systematic study of scientific method for the first time, from undergraduates to professionals in both the sciences and the humanities. My first impression: I was attracted to this book because I never took a course on the scientific method -- I learned about it by doing science. The mistakes in experimental design that I made as a beginning grad student were instructive, but I wasted more time than necessary on basic “type three” errors (providing the right answer to the wrong question) when I could have been making more advanced “type one” (statistical false positive) and “type two” (statistical false negative) errors instead!     . Photograph: Cambridge University Press   The Domestic Cat: The Biology of its Behaviour (3rd edition) by Dennis C. Turner and Patrick Bateson [286 pages, Cambridge University Press, 2013; Guardian bookshop; Amazon UK paperback/kindle UK; Amazon US paperback/kindle US] Publisher’s synopsis: The most commonly kept domestic animal in the developed world, the cat has been a part of human life for thousands of years. Cats have been both worshipped and persecuted over this long period -- either loved or hated for their enigmatic self-reliance and the subject of numerous myths and fables. Highlighting startling discoveries made over the last ten years, this new edition features contributions from experts in a wide range of fields, providing authoritative accounts of the behaviour of cats and how they interact with people. Thoroughly revised and updated to include information on the basic features of cat development and social life, the history of their relations with humans, health and welfare problems, and the breeding of cats for sale and for show. It is intended for all those, whether specialist or general reader, who love or are simply intrigued by these fascinating animals.  Builds on the success of the second edition, with updates highlighting startling discoveries made over the last ten years Features contributions from experts in a range of fields, providing insight into the behaviour of cats and how they interact with people Describes the history of human-cat relations, covering behaviour at home and in the wild and providing a definitive tool for any specialist or general reader who loves or is simply intrigued by these fascinating animals  My first impression: Nothing frightens ornithologists and birders more than being sucked into a protracted discussion about domestic cats because such discussions generate more heat than light. But this book is a scholarly answer to that conundrum -- meticulously researched, thorough and well-written -- and it also has cute drawing of domestic cats doing ... stuff. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

After decades of official censure (including from the present pope, in earlier guise), the big narrative of Christian theology is once again one of liberation for the poor and the oppressed. Salvation is not some private transaction between the individual and God, it is a public story in which the oppressed find freedom in the here and now. Theology, so liberation theologians insist, is a practical business and not an intellectual exercise. This is Jesus as half Marx and half Moses. Forget academic theory, angels dancing on pins, sterile arguments about God’s existence, the church’s obsession with clothes and buildings. Instead, think praxis: good news to the poor, freedom to the captive, sight to the blind. Doing is believing. And from the favelas of São Paulo to the shantytowns of Johannesburg, it rejuvenated Christianity by returning to its revolutionary roots. So why was it that these Palestinian Christians were having none of it? We were sitting in a cafe in Ramallah, close by the Kalandia checkpoint. Despite the fact that my Palestinian friends were constantly on the lookout for hermeneutic resources that might aid in the struggle against Israeli occupation, they seemed extremely reluctant to align themselves with liberation theology. It was only when we started talking about Moses that the scales fell from my eyes. From a western perspective, the Exodus story is the primary text of the biblical cry of freedom. The African slaves who sang spirituals in the cotton fields of America would link their suffering to that of the Jews under Ramses II. Thus, for instance, they sang: “Go down, Moses, Way down in Egypt’s land, Tell ole Pharaoh To let my people go.” But from a Palestinian perspective, one person’s liberation is another’s slavery. The very story African slaves told each other as the story of their anticipated liberation is, according to Palestinians, at the root of their current occupation. The slaves come out of Egypt and into a land promised them by God. And, for Palestinians, this promise is responsible for their military subjugation, for walls and settlements. How can a Palestinian Christian admire liberation theology in a world of “Guns ’n’ Moses” T-shirts? I went to see the new Exodus film the other night. And yes, Batman playing Moses and Breaking Bad’s Jesse Pinkman playing Joshua was a bit freaky. But the thing that really puzzled me was why Egypt, along with several other Arab states, has banned it. If anything, I thought it remarkably unsympathetic to the Jewish story. The Hebrew God comes across as a petulant psychopath, and Moses as a born-again loon. Indeed, when God starts murdering Egyptian infants, I find myself emotionally on the side of the Egyptians – which is not how Passover stories are supposed to make you feel. Short of agreeing with Freud and suggesting that Moses was actually an Egyptian all along, it would have been hard for Ridley Scott’s film to have disrupted the simple biblical binary of goodies (Hebrews) and baddies (Egyptians) any more than he did. And, for all the film’s multiple faults, I kind of admire him for that. The Egyptian ministry of culture says it banned the film because of historical inaccuracies that “offend Egypt and its pharaonic ancient history, in yet another attempt to Judaise Egyptian civilisation, which confirms the international Zionist fingerprints all over the film”. They must have been watching a different film to the one I saw, because I think that the people who ought to be most offended by this film are Jews, not Egyptians. OK, it suggests that Jews built the pyramids, which they didn’t. But as to it being a part of some big Zionist conspiracy, that’s ridiculous. If anything it seems to me an attack on Zionism. Unless, of course, the real worry is not with Scott’s interpretation, but with the Exodus/Promised land story itself. For the part that story plays in Zionism is, as my Palestinians friends attested, a complicated one. Liberation isn’t always as neat and tidy is it seems in the movies. @giles_fraser",profile/gilesfraser,Giles,Fraser

283,2015-01-02T15:56:21Z,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jan/02/getty-museum-in-focus-exhibition-birth-middle-class,Getty's In Focus exhibition snaps the birth of the middle class,artanddesign,Art and design,The Guardian,"While the Industrial Revolution upended the social and political order in Europe and America, it also created ungodly working conditions, including 16-hour workdays, almost nonexistent safety standards and child laborers whom factory owners considered disposable. It wasn’t until 1833 that labor laws finally began to appear in the UK (with the US soon following), and workdays were limited to ten hours. Children under 18 were prohibited from working factory jobs, night work was outlawed and inspectors were put in place to enforce the new rules. Where industrialization provided wealth and abundance for a new class of entrepreneurs, labor laws spawned a social class that was neither nobility nor utterly subservient: the middle class. With a steady income, fixed work hours and Sundays free, workers found themselves with more leisure time. These developments coincided with the introduction of photography in 1839; everyday people would soon have a device with which to record their activities. And record they did, as illustrated in In Focus: Play, a new exhibit at The Getty Museum in Los Angeles that runs until 10 May. “The main subject for the 19th century was something that signifies relaxation, something that signifies being removed from the work environment,” says curator Arpad Kovacs about the show, which was pulled from the Getty’s collection of 31,000 photos, including works by Henri Cartier-Bresson, Eugene Atget and Diane Arbus. With the proliferation of steamships and the expansion of rail systems, the middle class began to travel, and images of famous landmarks– like Platt D Babbitt’s 1855 daguerreotype of Niagara Falls – became fashionable. But cameras of the period were bulky devices requiring a tripod and prolonged exposure times, as well as a subject that would hold a position for longer than a minute, making it difficult to capture spontaneity. That changed in 1900, when George Eastman introduced the Brownie camera, a device that required no knowledge of photography. It came pre-loaded with film, and users just had to point and shoot. Exposed film was sent in for developing and prints arrived in the mail a few weeks later.    Children play in the Lower East Side, in New York City, 1937. Photograph: Arthur Fellig/International Center of Photography   The Brownie marked a revolution in the medium, and to some degree a revolution in art. Much of art history is dominated by images of important historical figures and portraits of nobility. The advent of photography hardly changed that trend initially, as indicated by the aristocratic figures in Roger Fenton’s The Billiard Room from 1858 or Camille Silvy’s exquisite albumen silver prints entitled Group of Their Royal Highnesses and The Duchess of St. Alban’s Stall (both from 1864). With the introduction of the Brownie, however, images of regular people living everyday lives became commonplace. “The Brownie cameras democratized photography for a lot of people,” explains Kovacs. “They were taking photographs of friends and relatives, and you do sort of get this mix of class systems, even in the 19th century. In the 20th century, you get a real proliferation of images of everything; the anonymous portrait, the anonymous couple.” Riding on a swing carousel in 1928, Hungarian photographer Martin Munkacsi turned his Leica on a pair of friends suspended in the air on the same ride, while Frenchman Brassai caught two lovers sneaking a kiss on an amusement park ride in 1935. One couple that is anything but anonymous is Marcel Duchamp and novelist Raoul de Roussy de Sales, who play chess in 1925 gelatin silver print by Man Ray. Periodicals in the 1920s began to feature photo-pictorials, which, like the Brownie, pushed the medium into the mainstream, featuring images of important events and people in addition to average citizens. Sporting events get little coverage in the Getty show, as rapid movement and long exposure times made for indecipherable imagery. “There are some really great photographs by Cartier-Bresson of baseball games, but the photographs aren’t of the baseball game – they’re of spectators,” says Kovacs. While further technological advances like color film and underwater housings freed hobbyists and artists alike, the medium began to define its own vernacular, moving away from the conventions of painting in photos like Hans Vollhardt’s fun house series from the 1920s, which depicted stretched and distorted bodies. Fifty years later, the warped heads of bathers in a pool shot from underwater in Larry Sultan’s Untitled 1979 chromogenic print make a convenient bookend to Vollhardt’s black-and-white images. While the medium has changed significantly, the subject of play remains essentially the same. Games, amusement parks, beaches and travel are still popular pastimes, and with a camera on every phone, candid images are ubiquitous. But none is more so than the selfie. “You do see self-portraits, but they are self-portraits rather than selfies,” explains Kovacs about the show. “The narrative that was built up was looking out and not necessarily at themselves. However, in looking to oneself, you would look to your family. That was an important subject of many of these early photographers and amateurs. It hasn’t changed that much.”",profile/jordan-riefe,riefe,jordan

I’m an electrician in Portland, Oregon, and she is a schoolteacher in Spokane, Washington, six hours away, and whenever we see each other, we hike. I picked her up from the airport and said, “We’re going on a road trip. If you see anything you want to explore, let me know.” We stopped and had a picnic at Beacon Rock, and while we were coming down the Oregon side, I said, “Hey, that mountain looks beautiful – let’s go climb it.” I’d gone to the peak of Munra Point with a friend to plan the route a month earlier, but she had no idea I knew exactly what I was doing. The climb starts out easy, then gets tough: a 1,500ft elevation over the course of a mile. I figured that, since my heart would be beating so hard from nerves, I might as well have a plausible excuse. She was worried we were on a trail that led around the mountain. I didn’t know how to reassure her that we were going to the top without giving away that I’d been there before, so when a guy passed us, I said, “How is it up there?” and he said, “Great.” One of those we passed and said hi to turned out to be Paul Wolfe, who took this picture on his iPhone. When I proposed, Katie said, “Yes! Yes!” A few days later, Wolfe uploaded the picture to Reddit, hoping to track us down. It took five hours. My best man, Dimitry, sent it to me. He wanted it to be a surprise, but it had already gone viral. There was no way to contain it. The great thing about this picture is it wasn’t staged, it captured an authentic moment. It’s amazing how fast the Redditors found us. I think everyone wants to be in a love story, and this was their opportunity to be part of one. Katie Verkovod I didn’t suspect at all that he was going to propose. Halfway through the hike, I gave him a hug and noticed his heart was beating really hard. I said, “Wow, Alex, you’re really out of shape, huh?” He said, “Round is a shape!” Now I know he was just nervous. At the top it was so beautiful, I went to give him another hug and he sort of pushed me away. I thought, “Maybe he wants space”, so I walked to the edge to look at the mountains. He told me later he thought, “Darn it!” because he was going to propose right there – he was pushing me away to talk to me. He’d never told me he loved me until that moment. Then he got on one knee and asked me to marry him. It was unbelievable. I’d known from the very beginning that that’s what I wanted. I was the last to find out about the photograph. A friend in Hawaii posted it, saying, “Is that you and Alex?!” It was crazy. I thought, how did that happen? Aleksander didn’t have a photographer. It’s incredible that complete strangers worked together to give us that photo. At that moment, it felt like the entire world had our backs. • Interview by Erica Buist Are you in a famous photograph?

285,2015-01-02T16:00:15Z,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/02/fire-songs-david-harsent-review,Fire Songs review – David Harsent’s apocalyptic collection,books,Books,The Guardian,"“Dreamwork delivers jump-cuts”, David Harsent writes towards the end of Fire Songs, and it’s a phrase that could be taken as a statement of his poetic modus operandi through much of his 11th collection. It delivers a stream of feverish, oneiric visions, of apocalypse brought about through war or environmental catastrophe or the boundless human capacity for self‑deception and bedevilment; and everywhere there’s the lick of flame – “it will be fire” is a recurring line. The collection makes rich use of symbol, especially biblical symbol, and reads somewhat like a modern-day Book of Revelation – there’s definitely something of the entranced, ecstatic visionary in some of the bravura pieces here. And it resounds with judgment, both historical and yet to come. Thematically, it’s organised around four “Fire” pieces, kicking off with the burning, in 1546, of Anne Askew, the Protestant martyr and poet whose chief offence against the church was her effrontery, first, in reading the Bible in English and, second, in seeking divorce from a man her father had decided she would marry in place of her elder sister who had died – in which, of course, she was following the lead of her king, who she appears to have thought would support her case. Instead she ended up in the tower, on the rack, at the hands of Richard Rich – she famously refused to name names – and then at Smithfield. “My dream of her puts me in close-by”, Harsent writes. His rendering of the scene is unsparing, “as her hair / goes up in a rush, as her fingers char, / as the spit on her tongue bubbles and froths, as she browns from heel / to head …” In her case, perhaps, the destructive power of fire is also one of regeneration, a harrowing of the body to purify the spirit: “In the fire lies your salvation, Anne, they said. What greater thing / than the brush of His hand as He stoops to take up your soul?” Here, as in the later “Fire: love songs and descants”, the rather more humdrum event of a bonfire provides the way in to the poem. In this case the speaker is burning “letters, cuttings, poems, diaries, notebooks”. The burning of the written word is a recurrent motif, whether it’s the speaker destroying his own papers, Dorothy Wordsworth “feeding the fire … with reams / of work half-done”, or, most devastatingly, in “Fire: a party at the world’s end”, a holocaust that betokens the end of civilisation and has “whole libraries on an updraught”. In contrast to Askew’s fate, this is no cleansing or refining distillation; rather, it has a hellish for-its-own-sake purity, which is nonetheless impressive and mesmerising, as flames are: It breaks and reforms: patterns unpick, the dancedips and spills, a churn of heads and arms, spin-dazeof ecstasy, a deadweight on the air which is augury, which is judgment, which is fire feeding fire. These poems have an eye, and a taste, for the macabre. “Sang the Rat” is an extraordinary catalogue of rat lore through the long history of human-rat interaction, from battlefield scavengers, to tales of rat-kings, to bringers of plague. The poem figures them as our shadow-selves, their cunning and species-success matched only by our own. “Rapacious like us prolific like us omnivorous like us prodigal like us unremitting like us like us a killer of its own kind.” The staccato grammar and long lines prove beguiling: “Gourmet of what’s necrotic what suppurates whatever’s gone to the bad graveyard morsels and fancies scraps of what’s soft in rot.” The long narrative poem “A Dream Book” also feasts on putrescence: “In the kitchen a meal half-eaten, fruit / gone to mush, maggots in meat, a web of mould on bread. Too late // for whoever it was to have back what they used to own. / The mould is blue and beautiful and infinitely delicate.” And here again, a dream-like narrative – albeit one formally arranged, into six-line rhyming stanzas – allows the poet to jump seamlessly between vignettes, in this case covering the life cycle of a relationship from desire and fulfilment to miscommunication and eventual indifference. But it’s not all nightmare, unease and grotesquerie. There’s also a lovely piece about hen harriers, a scattering of soundscape poems entitled “Tinnitus” that glance at Harsent’s musical career (he is a long-term collaborator with Harrison Birtwistle, to whom this volume is dedicated), as well as the extraordinary “Armistice”. This virtuosic piece is made of a single, unpunctuated sentence arranged into couplets that all rhyme on the letter D. It confounds one’s expectations for an “anti-war” poem by starting off in a world of unimpeachable niceness, a “Peaceable Kingdom”, a picture-book democracy of creation where lynx and lamb “walk untroubled in a sunlit wood / of wild fruits and hymnal birdsong”. But it isn’t long before you start to realise this really isn’t the sort of place you’d want to live – “where language is trimmed to be better understood / where those who mistake the road out for the road // to recovery are helped back by a rolling barricade / of white roses and bramble”. The poem disdains simplistic notions about peace and war and has the humility to acknowledge the limits of art. It ends with the striking image of Christ stepping down from the cross, “the sopping bud of his heart in his outstretched hand while the dead // silence that draws out over battlefield and potter’s field / is what remains of the truth of it and must be left unsaid”. • To order Fire Songs for £10.39 go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.",profile/adam-newey,newey,adam

What can I do?,lifeandstyle,Life and style,The Guardian,"I am 28 and was with a man I truly loved for a year and half. We were about to move in together when he ended it. I don’t understand why. Less than two months later he’s on dating websites and seeing lots of women. I just want him back, I want our life back. I feel broken and alone. How do I overcome the feeling of betrayal and trust anyone again? I’m trying. I’m seeing friends, going to the gym and focusing on my job, but I just feel empty and lost.By the time you read this, I’m sure you’re feeling better than when you wrote your letter, because really that’s the only thing that makes heartbreak better – time. Pure conjecture, but it sounds like your boyfriend got spooked by commitment and decided to get out before taking the next step. Whatever the reasons, it’s infinitely better for you that he figured out now – before you got married, had kids – that there were still wild oats to be sown. Not to diminish the agony you’re feeling. It’s horrible. We’ve all been there, on one side or another – heart-breaker and broken alike. Both are hellish, but I’m going to go on record and say that having your heart broken might suck a little bit more. Sure, the heartbreaker feels guilty for hurting a person they once loved, but the neurotransmitter house party going on in their brain created by new romantic possibility drowns it out. The heartbroken, meanwhile, just feels pain, and is left with unanswerable questions, the top one usually being, “What’s wrong with me?” Don’t worry, there is nothing wrong with you. And you are doing all of the right things, except for one: there is no reason you need to know about his dating activity. Not so long ago, when we broke up, it was done. We exchanged belongings, friends picked sides and everyone moved on. Years might pass before we heard news of our former object of affection. Now, we hear everything online. It’s like dating a celebrity whose every move is chronicled in those magazines you read while getting your nails done. But you don’t have to. Knowing what he’s doing will not help you move on, so block him on social media. And guess what? Being where you are isn’t so bad. Feel what you feel and know it’s ephemeral. You will fall in love again. I can’t promise you won’t face betrayal. Chances are you will, because that’s what humans do. But you will also forgive and be forgiven because, thankfully, we do that, too. • Send your dilemmas about love, family or life in general to askmolly@theguardian.com",profile/molly-ringwald,ringwald,molly
287,2015-01-02T16:03:32Z,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/02/deptford-apex-of-fashionability,How Deptford became the ‘apex of fashionability’ and other stories,commentisfree,Opinion,The Guardian,"Human settlements come and go, and wax and wane: Babylon, Troy, Goldsmith’s Deserted Village. Those of us who grew up among mines and factories might be especially aware of how quickly a place can change or vanish. A parent might point out the site of a works, a pub or a street, or sometimes wave a hand towards some fields or moorland where an entire village had gone missing, complete with its church, tavern, school and Co-op, leaving an overgrown spoil heap as the only evidence of the thousands of local lives that had once depended on a now-exhausted coal seam. Nobody then imagined that the economy of such a place could have been renewed by the intrusion of commuters or some Frank Gehry-style architecture and a Wi-Fi cafe. The craft of “place-making” had still to be invented. I came across the phrase this week in the publicity for a property developer, Cathedral Group PLC, which is building a block of 132 flats in Deptford, south-east London. Deptford is among the city’s poorest districts, and despite its closeness to the financial centres of the City and Canary Wharf – each a few minutes away by train – has yet to feel the full impact of soaring London house prices and the onward march of the foreign investor. It could never be called pretty, and its fortunes began their decline long ago, when the royal dockyard was closed in 1869, but it remains an intensely interesting locality; not only historically, as the place where Drake’s Golden Hind and Christopher Marlowe met their end, but also for its vivid present. Shops in its narrow high street promise to unlock mobiles and cash benefit cheques instantly; fishmongers – there are many – display unfamiliar species with their mouths agape, salted and unsalted and piled high on the slab; Vietnamese cafes sit next to Nigerian nail bars and Bangladeshi halal butchers; and somehow in all this migrant activity a couple of pie-and-mash joints persist – empty on the day I went into one, except for a couple of young men sitting under the flag of St George and chewing their way through some of England’s toughest pastry. Almost everything in the street looks makeshift and cheap. How can the foreign investor be made to understand that such a scene represents opportunity? The answer is to imagine it as an embryonic Shoreditch. In a promotional video, the Cathedral Group’s creative director, Martyn Evans, says that the arrival of “artists and creatives” has put Deptford at “the apex of fashionability”. Tim Murphy, the managing director of IP Global, a property investment firm that is promoting Cathedral’s scheme to its clients in East Asia, explains how money can be made. “You can just see it [Deptford] hasn’t had all that money thrown at it yet,” Murphy says to camera outside Deptford station. “And that’s what you want. When you’re investing in property, you don’t want trendy stores … and Starbucks everywhere, because that means the prices have already gone [up].” On the other hand, “ … when the artists start coming, that’s when you want to get in!” In other words, this is the wisdom of the ages: buy low and sell high. But rarely has the profit motive been so plainly enunciated – so plainly, in fact, that the video became a cause celebre in Deptford and an embarrassment to its backers, who have taken it offline. The developers would like to see themselves slightly differently, as givers as well as takers, as agents (so the Cathedral website says) for socio-economic change, equipped with the skills to “generate value in unlikely neighbourhoods” and “turn around lost pockets of London and the South East, and put broken places back together again”. By which they mean converting old industrial sites into flats – other examples of Cathedral’s work include a wharf in Greenwich and the former HMV works at Hayes (now retitled The Old Vinyl Factory). Of course, developers have been stressing the former uses of their conversions for as long as houses have been called The Old Rectory; it provides them with an attractive thing, a history. But putting “broken places back together” is a much bigger ambition. Many of the old markers of place are vanishing – the local jobs, the local factory and office, the local post office and branch library, the local pub – precisely because more money can be made if the buildings that house them are converted into houses and flats. (In Islington, where I live, 71 office buildings have been approved for conversion in the past 18 months.) In that way, developers destroy the localism they pretend to cherish, though in Deptford’s case, at least the building is new and not carved out of something more interesting or useful. How will it mend its broken locality? The development promises to remind Deptford of its history by restoring the carriageway that slopes up to the station, built in 1836 and one of the oldest pieces of railway architecture in London. The arches that support it will hold artisan workshops. There will be a new public square and space for two restaurants. And who will live in this newly mended place? According to IP Global, prices start at $804,000 for the smaller flats, which in local currency is about £516,000. In Kuala Lumpur or Hong Kong, it could be considered a bargain. Deptford’s other towering plans After my walk down Deptford High Street, I crossed Creek Road and made my way towards the Thames, on a route through a quiet council estate that took me past the church where Marlowe is buried and then a nice-looking pub, the Dog and Bell, which advertised real ale. I last came here nearly 45 years ago, when I was a new boy in London and knew very few people and liked to explore the river on my days off. I wish I had clearer memories of this place then, when coasters still tied up in Deptford Creek and Deptford power station was fuelled with coal brought by collier from the Tyne and Wear; but the truth is that what I mainly remember are the multistorey council blocks named the Pepys Estate, after Samuel Pepys, who often came to Deptford on Admiralty business. Trade on the Thames was dying when I was last here, but not quite dead. Now I looked across an empty river, the windows on the opposite bank’s towers inflamed by the setting sun and the electric signs advertising their ownership – HSBC, Citibank, JP Morgan – beginning to brighten against a darkening sky. Soon there will be towers on the south bank, too: Boris Johnson has approved plans for two towers of 38 storeys and a third of 48 storeys (Canary Wharf’s central tower is 50 storeys) to be built by the Hong Kong-based conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa at Convoys Wharf. Compared to this, Deptford’s other development is a pinprick. The towers will hold 3,500 flats – 500 of them defined as “affordable”, the rest sold for whatever the market dictates to owners who see London property as a safe and easily tradeable asset rather than a home. Month by month and year by year, it becomes steadily more obvious to Londoners that what shapes our lives and townscape is the power of other nations’ money. That is the real place-maker – or is it place-breaker?",profile/ianjack,Ian,Jack

The confrontation – unusual in seeing US diplomatic staff targeted – occurred between a US consular party and far-right settlers from the illegal Adei Ad outpost on the occupied West Bank on Friday. While the initial details are sketchy it appears the US diplomats – accompanied by a security team – had been in the area after being invited by Palestinian farmers from the village of Turmus Aya, north-east of Ramallah, to examine olive saplings that had been uprooted overnight on Thursday by settlers. The consular officials were asked to attend because some of the land owners affected hold US citizenship. According to Palestinian reports quoting land owners, in recent days settlers uprooted more than 5,000 olive tree saplings, some of which had been planted to mark the recent death of senior Palestinian official Ziad Abu Ein, who collapsed and died after being manhandled by an Israeli soldier. When the US vehicles arrived on the scene, close to the outpost, settlers exited the outpost and a confrontation ensued in which the American cars were stoned. It was during this confrontation that US security officers drew a side arm and a rifle. Police spokeswoman Luba Samri said the settlers threw rocks at the officials who were forced to return to their vehicle. She said that accompanying American security personnel did not use their weapons during the incident. According to Israeli officials quoted by Israel Radio the US convoy had not coordinated with security officials before making the visit. “The settlers attacked the cars of the US consulate in the town Turmus Aya near the settlement of Adi Ad,” a local Palestinian, Zakaria Sadah, posted on his Facebook page. The US armoured vehicles were lightly damaged during the confrontation which saw the visit cancelled. Vandalism by settlers of Palestinian olive trees is a persistent problem with prosecutions very rare. There was no comment from the US embassy.",profile/peterbeaumont,Peter,Beaumont

Doherty’s body was found approximately 20 hours after he was reported missing from Suede bar, off Deansgate, where he had been celebrating the new year with friends. “I am extremely saddened to have to report that one of our under-20s team players, Kyle Doherty, has been found dead following a night out in Manchester,” said the Stenhousemuir chairman, Bill Darroch, in a club statement. “We are all devastated by this news and our immediate thoughts are with Kyle’s family and friends at this sad and difficult time. Kyle was a talented footballer and had been a part of Stenhousemuir since signing for us in July 2013.

So well done to reporter Steve Goodman for obtaining (especially by current British footballing standards) a revealing interview. But... and it’s a big but... It was not the scoop it purported to be because Goodman’s piece had been lifted entirely from a French football website, Hat-Trick. All the quotes were contained in a Q&A interview with Faure by the site’s owner, the enterprising French journalist Romain Molina. There was no attribution to him or his website. Indeed, it would appear to any reader as if Faure had spoken to Goodman. Now an angry Molina is planning to sue the Record.  After seeing the Record piece, he tweeted to the paper: “Can you explain me why my interview with Sébastien Faure became your interview?” He says he received no reply from the paper despite contacting them several times. But his tweet did elicit a series of dismissive and sarcastic responses from the Record’s senior football writer, Keith Jackson.  He referred to Molina as a “drama queen” and thought his complaint “a pathetic overreaction”. He followed up by tweeting that if Molina “has his knickers in a twist then he should take it up with Steve Goodman.” Jackson then pointed out that Goodman is a freelance, based in England, who “regularly translates articles in foreign papers and submits to UK papers.” But that hardly excuses him failing to credit Molina and revealing the provenance of the interview. You can read the original, in French, here to compare the two versions. Molina also manages a blog about British football for L’Equipe (www.kickoff.blogs.lequipe.fr) and says the Faure incident is not an isolated example of the Record “borrowing” his pieces. He cites his interview of Tony Andreu last year (see Record piece here and Molina’s piece, two days’ earlier, here). By the way, according to Google Translate, the French for plagiarism is plagiat. It’s a good resource for translating single words but, after reading Goodman’s re-working of Molina’s original, it is possible he may also have used it.  Molina agrees: “The worst thing of this story is the translation”, he tweeted. “Don’t tell me you used Google Translate mister Steve Goodman... It’s crazy.” It’s a sad episode that, incidentally, reminded me of this blogpost in August 2013 about Jackson’s reporting of Rangers.",profile/roygreenslade,Roy,Greenslade

After that, I got my head up.” It was autumn 2013 and the Northern Ireland Under-19 international, then regarded as one of the most promising young left-backs at Sunderland, had just learned that his cruciate ligament had ruptured for a second time. After 12 months on the sidelines, Watson’s knee failed to withstand his comeback training session with the club’s reserves and the events which would lead him to an upstairs lounge at Croft Park on a wintry morning this week were set in motion. Outside, frost lingers on the roofs of the tight terraces surrounding Blyth Spartans’ home and the streets running down to the town centre and the port beyond are unusually quiet. For most people it’s the lull between Christmas and new year but Watson made the 25-mile drive up the north-east coast from his Wearside home on something of an adrenaline high. It is the Tuesday before FA Cup third-round Saturday and two years of operations and seemingly endless rehabilitation, followed by the pain of being released by Sunderland, have almost been forgotten. After four months of combining life as a semi-professional in the Evo-Stik Northern Premier League with qualifying as a personal trainer, the 21-year-old is preparing for the visit of the Championship side Birmingham City. Along with several of his Blyth team-mates, this is Watson’s chance to showcase his talents to a wider audience. “I do have a Plan B, personal training, but my main ambition is to get back into the professional game so this is a great chance for me,” says Watson. “I’ve got complete confidence in my knee now but, after what’s happened in the last couple of years, I never expected to be playing in the FA Cup this weekend.” Locals of a certain age out shopping in the town’s attractive 19th-century main market square and Keel Row, the adjacent 1990s mall, could have put him straight. Blyth may be this season’s lowest-ranked survivors but back in 1978 Ted Croker, then the FA secretary, dubbed them “the world’s most famous non league club”. That was after a ground-breaking Cup run in which Spartans took Wrexham to a fifth-round replay at a packed St James’ Park. In January 2009 Blackburn Rovers felt fortunate to escape Croft Park with a narrow third-round victory. As happened six years ago Celebrations, a card shop in Havelock Street, is among the local businesses to have dressed their windows in Spartans’s eye-catching green and white. Rather like its football team, Blyth itself is distinctive. In an era when small English towns are often increasingly homogenous it is set apart by giant offshore wind turbines which dominate the skyline for miles around and a port specialising in the import of Scandinavian forest products for, among other things, furniture and newspapers. Situated just off the road between Newcastle’s well-heeled northern suburbs and the Northumbria tourist trail heading for the ancient castles and sandy beaches of Warkworth, Dunstanburgh and Bamburgh, Blyth’s re-adaption to life after the death of heavy industry in a locality subsequently targeted by heroin dealers has not always been easy. Much hard work lies behind the current air of regeneration, reflected by the town’s central conservation area and a series of smart new housing developments. Not that Gary Rowett and his Birmingham players are likely to be charmed by the 4,000 capacity Croft Park, its “Welcome to Sparta” banners and an atmosphere so intimate that cutting individual comments from the stands are often audible on a pitch prone to bogginess. “The away dressing room’s painted a really dark colour,” says Watson. “It’s cold and not very nice. Not many Birmingham players will want to be here.” Psychology can only take you so far but Watson suspects Birmingham may be surprised by the technical ability of a Blyth side who won at League Two Hartlepool in the second round. “When I got here I was surprised at how high the standard was,” he says. “Tom Wade [Blyth’s manager] is a very good coach and when I saw how comfortable some of our lads were on the ball I thought: ‘how aren’t they playing professionally?’ “At this level the fitness isn’t the same because we train twice a week and people have full-time jobs but, technically, a lot of professionals aren’t drastically ahead of us. There are a few lads here who could have made it as pros but it’s a lot about being in the right place at the right time and luck with injuries.” If and when Watson returns to full-time football he will “never take anything for granted” again. “Coming to Blyth has been great but it’s also been a bit of a culture shock,” he says. “At Sunderland you go in every morning, your kit’s all ready for you, the physios are always there if you need them and everything’s on a plate. I’ve gone from training every day to twice a week so I’ve had to do much more myself. I go for runs and to the gym on my own. You have to adapt and look after yourself more.” If personal training is an ideal career choice for a non-league player, many of Watson’s team-mates perform tricky juggling acts. While Peter Jeffries, the goalkeeper, is a scaffolder, midfielder Matty Wade constructs oil platforms, centre-half Nathan Buddle labours on a building site and winger Jarrett Rivers gets up early to work in his mother’s newsagents. With Wade’s eclectic squad also containing a fashion designer, a psychology student, a civil engineer, a computer software salesman, a taxi driver, a plumber, a passport office official, a Nissan car factory worker and Samuel Pérez, the brother-cum-chaperone of the Newcastle striker Ayoze Pérez, the dressing room reflects rather more catholic views and experiences than many of its Football League counterparts. “It’s really friendly, really welcoming. Everyone gets on, there’s no cliques,” says Watson, whose ideal fourth-round opponents would be either Sunderland or Manchester United. “Everyone’s busy but we manage a few nights out.” Should celebrations be in order on Saturday evening, he and his team-mates will be wondering if they might be poised to follow in Alan Shoulder’s footsteps. Until the FA Cup caught him in its 1977-78 spotlight Shoulder combined working long underground shifts as a coal miner with earning £14 playing up front for Spartans but the striker’s part in the fifth-round odyssey was destined to change his life beyond recognition. Having captured the attention of Newcastle United scouts, he continued convincing them to the point where a £20,000 move to St James’ Park was sealed the following December. Back in that upstairs lounge at Croft Park, Watson smiles and dreams of making another, happier call to his father. “I’m looking forward to testing myself against Birmingham,” he says. “It’s a great opportunity.”",profile/louisetaylor,taylor,louise

They gave Tottenham Hotspur a fair workout in January 1955, losing 2-0, but five years later they dropped out of the Football League and the climb back to relevance has, to put it kindly, been gradual. It is a tale that their assistant manager can identify with. Darren Caskey’s past decade can best be described as peripatetic, his list of employers coming as a surprise when cast against his early blossoming at Tottenham. In 1993, Caskey captained England in the Uefa Under-18 Championship final, scoring the winning penalty and looking a prospect as big as team-mates Gary Neville, Sol Campbell, Paul Scholes and Robbie Fowler. The “new Hoddle” comparisons arrived and there were 43 first-team appearances for Spurs, but it never quite happened for Caskey despite his technical gifts. Subsequent respectability at Reading and Notts County felt anticlimactic. Since leaving the latter club in 2004 he had drifted, playing for a number of non-league sides and spending a season in the USA’s second tier with Virginia Beach Mariners. Now concentrating on a coaching career that has gained traction since joining Gateshead as Gary Mills’ assistant in September 2013, he returns to the top tier on Saturday as their upwardly mobile Conference side attempt to upset West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns. “We think we’ve turned the club around massively since we’ve worked here,” Caskey tells the Guardian, and it is hard to argue. Gateshead had lost six of their first nine games last season when Caskey joined his friend Mills, the 1980 European Cup winner with Nottingham Forest. They went on to finish third in the Conference, losing 2-1 to Cambridge United in the play-off final. “After I left Notts County I stuttered and stumbled a bit, not really knowing where I was going,” says Caskey. “I went through several clubs and then had a lovely year in America which revitalised me. The choice was then between pottering about in the lower leagues or making a serious decision to give coaching a go. I served my apprenticeship with player-coach jobs at Kettering, Halesowen and Ilkeston. I’ve learned a lot that I can put into use at Gateshead and think I’ve still plenty to offer the game.” Caskey is now 40 and, although still registered as a player, his time is spent helping Mills develop a team in their own image. “The gaffer was brought up by Brian Clough and I learned from Terry Venables, so it’s all about playing on the grass,” he says. “We try to get the ball down and play it from the back, and wouldn’t ever change. The gates have doubled since we’ve been here so people seem happy. “We’ll need that philosophy against West Brom. We’re used to dominating possession and, although we know we won’t get as much as usual, we’ll have to keep the ball for good periods if we’re to take anything from the game. I’m sure Tony Pulis will give them a lift but we’ll play as we always do and try to show what a decent side we are.” Among that side are a 36-year-old John Oster, the former Everton and Sunderland player, and the South Africa international Matty Pattison, once of Newcastle and Norwich. Gateshead have experience, on pitch and touchline, beyond that of most underdogs and hope that it may be brought to bear at The Hawthorns and in the future. “Our aim at the start of the season was to finish in the top five and get to the third round of the FA Cup,” says Caskey. “We’ve done one and are four points short of the other. We’ve broken a few records since we got here already; if we can show what we’re all about on Saturday and then get back into the Football League, it would be incredible.”",profile/nick-ames,Nick ,Ames

So much so that scripts handed out to the few cast and production team members privileged enough to get their hands on one had their names watermarked into every page for security reasons. We haven’t seen one either, but here are five things you probably shouldn’t expect. Script Note One: There will not be a body at the bottom of the cliffs which provided the starting point for the first series. At least, not a dead body. There will likely be sand in the shoes of returning cast members David Tennant, Olivia Colman, Jodie Whittaker and Andrew Buchan (along with new additions including Charlotte Rampling). Script Note Two: Tennant and Colman, who both played coppers in the award-winning drama’s first outing, will not be married in a clifftop ceremony in West Bay, Dorset before retiring to a glitzy showbiz shindig in the town’s local hostelry. Script Note Three: Anna Gunn, who replaced Colman in the American remake Gracepoint, will not make a surprise appearance as an FBI agent sent to help unravel the latest Broadchurch mystery. Script Note Four: The Daleks are not going to invade the sleepy coastal town whose community was torn apart by the murder of a schoolboy in the first season, despite Tennant and show creator Chris Chibnall’s previous exploits on Doctor Who. Not least because Broadchurch is an ITV show and Doctor Who belongs to the Beeb. Script Note Five: Bob Mortimer’s plea to get a part as a red herring for the second season has been ignored by the production. Note: all above script notes subject to change.",profile/monkey,monkey,

I have an occasional urge to be a hermit, especially at this time of year. Someone like Johnnie Logie, Britain’s last recorded hermit (do they have registers?), who, in 1927, tramped down the coast of Ayrshire and came to a stop round about here, settling himself into a cosy cave near Kirkmaiden, where he lived for the next 35 years with all mod cons (wood-burning stove, rainwater gathering system, potatoes grown in foraged seaweed; very 2015). He only left his cave twice, to visit the hospital 15 miles away, and didn’t care all that much for the rest of the world: “Oh, I wish I was back in mae ain wee cave,” he told the Sunday Post. A wise man, that Johnnie. The Machars peninsula is a little backwater, in the best sense of the word, where the eddying flows of life come to rest. I can see myself there. What’s not to like? Shallow sandy beaches warmed by the Gulf Stream (St Medans Beach for me); rock pools; the freshest of fishmongers; deer; curlews; Neolithic stone circles; barely a tourist in sight; a teeny town (Wigtown, Scotland’s “book town”) that has one bookshop for every 50 people; 36-bedroom Georgian stately homes going for the price of my London flat. Wee dram. Sorted. For the rest of my life. Now then, which cave? The case against Precious little. A tad wet. Well connected? Not really what you’re here for. The train is a mythical beast in far-off lands. Buses go to Newton Stewart. But a car is vital if you must travel further: from Wigtown, Newton Stewart is 15 minutes, Dumfries 75 and the A74 (M) 90. Schools Primaries: all the locals including Wigtown and Kirkinner are mostly “good”, says HMIE, though some inspection reports are up to a decade old. The local secondary, Douglas-Ewart High in Newton Stewart, was mostly weak or adequate, but again, the inspection was 2006.

They are just clothes, which are quite different. They are about as far from the experimental, leather-culotte school of dressing as you can get. Something you wear to keep warm, as you might wear a dressing gown on cold mornings. A lot of the time, you don’t even plan them as part of an outfit: you get dressed of a morning, in jeans and a shirt or whatever, and then put a jumper on top later. But it’s January, and I don’t know about you but I don’t feel like wearing leather culottes now. On the other hand, I expect to spend most days in jumpers. So let’s talk about jumpers. At this point we should differentiate between jumpers and knitwear. Jumpers are what you keep stuffed in a big drawer; knitwear is what you hang in your wardrobe. Jumpers are practical; knitwear has a crisp-winter-walk, marshmallows-in-the-hot-chocolate lifestyle thing going on. Obviously, like any other normal human being, if I’m at home on the sofa, I’ll take a jumper every time. Preferably one with worn out holes in the cuffs, and a neckline that has gone slightly loose (so much more comfortable than that can’t-breathe feeling crew necks have when they are new. Ugh.) But most of us are not in a position to spend every day of the month on the sofa. And the thumb-hole thing doesn’t, if we’re being honest, project a professional image of polished efficiency. That’s where knitwear comes in. Knitwear is definitely fashion, not clothes. Knitwear is signposted in department stores; jumpers come in boxes at jumble sales. And being fashion, knitwear is at the mercy of trends. The trend right now, slightly confusingly, is for knitwear that looks like jumpers. To be specific, jumpers that have “jumped up” slightly in the wash, so the hemline is shorter than it was. They remain chunky around the neckline and shoulders, but finish at the waist. To be a This Season Knit, then, you need a normal knit – a jumper, in fact – but shorter. To make it clear you are in knitwear, wear it with a dramatic full skirt; or with the new season’s flared trousers. We’ll get to them presently, when we’ve eased ourselves off the sofa. After that, possibly leather culottes. All in good time. For now, let’s just wean ourselves off the thumb-holes. • Jess wears cropped jumper, £79, by & Other Stories, stories.com.

297,2015-01-02T16:35:27Z,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jan/02/homelessness-victorian-london-exhibition-geffrye-museum,Homelessness in Victorian London: exhibition charts life on the streets,artanddesign,Art and design,The Guardian,"There will probably be people sleeping rough tonight on the same benches, along the Embankment in London, where William Booth interviewed homeless men in 1890. The story of Booth’s Salvation Army hostels will form part of a major exhibition this spring – and people who go along may be surprised by the answers he got on the night of 13 June. The men on the benches didn’t think they had found too bad a bed. “It’s very fair out here of nights, seat’s rather hard, but a bit of waste paper makes it a lot softer. We have women sleep here often, and children too,” one told him. There was rarely any trouble: “We’re too sleepy to make a row.” Little material evidence survives from the lives of the Victorian poor, said Hannah Fleming, a curator at the Geffrye in east London. The exhibition will include photographs and paintings, but the poorest who went through the hostels owned almost nothing. The scraps of evidence that do survive are rare and precious: Fleming recently bought on eBay a bottle of carbolic acid and an enamel spittoon. Treasures in the exhibition include a few colourful bits of broken pottery excavated from a pit at Gun Street in Spitalfields, once the outdoor privy for a common lodging house. These institutions were mainly regarded with horror – one report called them “extremely filthy and disgusting”. The crockery, however, is a different story: the pink roses and willow pattern fragments could have come from any middle-class house. Jane Hamlett, senior lecturer on modern British history at Royal Holloway, and the leader of a group of academics whose research on Victorian homeless inspired the exhibition, said it was not always the desperate experience immortalised by Charles Dickens in Oliver Twist’s workhouse. “If you were elderly, or ill, or a child, then often there was no alternative to going into an institution. You were stuck, and it could be very grim. But some of the able-bodied learned to play the system very well, went into and came out of shelters repeatedly, and some learned a trade and managed to get themselves out of poverty. The experience of the Victorian homeless was far from uniform.”    ‘Coffin beds’ at a Salvation Army shelter in London. Photograph: Salvation Army   A photograph shocking to modern eyes shows “coffin beds”, wooden boxes barely big enough for a body, laid out in rows, but Hamlett said if the alternative was sleeping in a wet doorway, many thought a hard but dry, clean bed was a fine thing. “The Salvation Army in particular was very keen on carbolic, and put a very high store on keeping everything clean,” she said. A woman in Hanbury Street shelter, Whitechapel, in 1894 told a visitor: “I did used to think myself lucky if I’d the chance of a fourpenny lodging, but now I’d a deal sooner sleep in a bunk and have the feelin’ of safety there is about this place.” The mealtime seen in another image, a giant room filled with hundreds of men seated in long silent rows, looks truly grim, but a report on Hanbury Street said there was always boiling water so people arriving for the night could make a cup of tea. Middle-class Victorians expected the poor to be meek and grateful for their charity, but many were not. Hamlett, her colleagues and Fleming are working hard to recover the voices of those in the system, not just the do-gooders observing them. Their views survive in interviews such as those conducted by Booth and Henry Mayhew, visitors’ accounts, rare autobiographies – and graffiti. One man wrote on a shelter wall in Chester in 1865 “this bloody hole is lousey”. An inmate of a casual ward, where people could stay for a night or two, said: “You are obliged to bathe, of course; sometimes three will bathe in one water, and if you complain they turn nasty and ask if you are come to a palace.” The giant Rowton House hostels were built by the philanthropist Lord Rowton in an effort to provide better accommodation than the casual wards or lodging houses. Again, experience varied widely. In 1899 WA Somerville, a journalist who spent time living in one, described it as a home where a lodger “may read books, write letters, and above all mix with what he pathetically calls his ‘mates’”, but one Jack Smithers wrote that sleep was impossible “owing to the ravings of the drunken, the coughing of the sick, the nightmares of the mentally tortured, sundry grunts, snores and other indescribable noises”. Similarities to the growing problem of homelessness in 21st-century British cities are brutally obvious, and deliberate. The Geffrye – a museum devoted to the home in a charming square of 17th-century almshouses – will have a parallel exhibition created by the New Horizon Youth Centre, whose members are themselves homeless or vulnerable. One told a Geffrye researcher: “It seems to be going back to the way this was … it seems that all the changes that were being made in a positive way … to try and make things better for homeless people... you know, it’s just going backwards.” Homes of the Homeless: Seeking Shelter in Victorian London, the Geffrye, London, 24 March-12 July • This article was amended on 16 January 2015.

Liverpool got the ball rolling themselves, confirming what was widely reported on New Year’s Day, that Gerrard will be calling time on his career at Anfield in the summer, with gushing praise from the Reds’ manager, Brendan Rodgers, and the club’s owners swiftly following.  Brendan Rodgers on Gerrard: ""This is an era where 'legend' is vastly overused, but in his case it actually doesn't do him justice."" #LFCicon— Liverpool FC  (@LFC) January 2, 2015  No less than 23 of his Liverpool team-mates were also quoted on their official website with Mario Balotelli saying: “Wow. I think of him as being at the same level as Pirlo … Stevie can do anything, he’s an amazing player.” Martin Skrtel chose a more succinct tribute, simply stating: ‘Stevie is special.” Gerrard’s former Liverpool midfield partner, Dietmar Hamann, was among the first to comment on Twitter.  An era comes to the end with SG leaving LFC. I think he made the right call. What a career,what a player.Thx for the many wonderful moments.— Didi Hamann (@DietmarHamann) January 2, 2015  Liverpool then quoted the man himself, who claimed it was not a decision he took lightly.  Gerrard: ""This has been the toughest decision of my life, one both me and my family have agonised over for a good deal of time."" #LFCicon— Liverpool FC  (@LFC) January 2, 2015  A recurring theme throughout was whether Gerrard is the best player to ever play for Liverpool – John Aldridge certainly thinks so.

Their previous guests comprised a who’s who of contemporary house, including Motor City Drum Ensemble – AKA German House trailblazer Danilo Plessow – and Detroit DJ Andrés, both of whom they brought to Manchester’s Roadhouse during the past year. As such, Danuka – co-founder and resident of the night – has picked up more than a few head-turning tunes along the way. Rooted primarily in hip-hop and jazz, he seamlessly and gradually blends in a wider variety of forward-thinking music to irresistibly rhythmic effect. Here, he ventures outside the auspices of his club night, taking control of the decks at Chorlton’s Oddest Bar for this new Friday series. For those desperate for a hint of more sunlight at this time of year, this So Flute DJ undoubtedly has it covered. Oddest Bar, Chorlton, Fri JT Exploited, London Shir Khan’s label Exploited has been carving out its own little deep house empire since 2007, specialising in the sort of thing that’s contemptuously bland when thudding out of a bar’s speakers at 10pm, only to feel just right around 3am when you’ve dug your heels in for an extended session. He’s also spun off the rather crassly titled disco edit label Black Jukebox, where the likes of Donnie & Joe Emerson or Al Green get kicked up a gear – much of the time it’s sacrilegious but occasionally it picks out and buffs up the grooves. Here, he plays alongside his label charges Adana Twins and Joyce Muniz. The former juxtapose emotion-inflating chords with gruff bass, in smoothly overlapping longform blends; the latter drifts towards beautifully honed minimalism but patters back to twittering melody and Balearic joy. You won’t get much edge but those smooth surfaces might be all the better for sliding into the depths.   Egg London, N7, Fri BB Medlar, Edinburgh A new party at Scotland’s best micro sweatbox, Sneaky Pete’s, is the aptly named In Deep. Kicking off 2015 in seriously smooth style is their booking of Medlar, the British DJ and producer at home with the WOLF Music crew (alongside Bicep and Waze & Odyssey). What makes Medlar’s sound his own, though, is how he makes house sound like hip-hop. In turning the lightest jazz sample or bellowing note from a diva into a short, sharp snap of the fingers, this deftness of touch saw his 2013 debut album Sleep hailed as an underground hit. Returning to Edinburgh again, a DJ set from Medlar is a fine way to cleanse your post-New Year palette with some beautiful house music.

Speaking as someone who took years to twig that I had breast cancer, I’m full of awe that someone could even notice that there was something ailing a fish, let alone that someone else could examine the fish, diagnose constipation and then carry out technologically sophisticated surgery. And yet it all makes sense, in an odd sort of way. If you’re going to have fish as pets, then the only possible meaningful interaction you can have with them is to take very seriously your commitment to keeping them going, so that you can carry on looking at them. What else is there? And, when you think about it, this story has been a long time coming. When I was a child, lots of people kept goldfish – quite often goldfish won at the fair and transferred from tiny plastic bag to not-much-larger goldfish bowl. The cramped space in the goldfish bowl was quite often hogged by an ornamental castle featuring an arch and some artificial pond weed. When the goldfish died, you flushed it down the toilet and replaced it with another, often keeping the sentimental but inattentive children none the wiser. Fish, hamsters, mice, birds – it was the same for all of them. I feel certain that the majority of custom in most pet shops was people seeking a creature identical to the creature it was quietly replacing. Nowadays, this is not considered very desirable behaviour. Even goldfish, it is now understood, need some level of attention to quality of life, and a decent-sized tank with some sort of gizmo for doing something healthy to the water. The goldfish bowl is now mainly a metaphor, indicative of a highly limited life spent in captivity and on display, every bit as awful as being married to Tony Blair. So, actually, quite a lot of effort has gone into increasing our empathy for goldfish in recent decades. This Norfolk enthusiast has merely taken the trend to some kind of majestic apotheosis. And there is something majestic here, I think. The news is dominated so greatly by cruelty and selfishness that it’s quite touching, this story of a fish so well beloved by such a solicitous owner that its little heart was monitored as its blockage was removed. Sure, it’s only a fish, and therefore the level of care and attention is absurd. It’s a silly story. And yet … care, nurture, responsibility, love – these are such positive attributes that they are always precious, even when directed at a wee fish. Little is known about the owner of the fish, except that he either has £300 to spare or truly excellent pet insurance. The level of sympathy you may feel for this chap depends largely on how desperately you need £300. And a lot of people in this country need £300 very desperately indeed. When a society is so unequal that it can’t even achieve universal enjoyment of an “and finally” story as perfect as this one, then we really are in trouble. For there is indeed an opportunity to go full Bolshevik on this one. What sort of a society has the capacity both to monitor the heart of an anaesthetised goldfish and leave families to queue up at food banks clutching referral vouchers? The short answer? Human society, made up of humans. It’s the great mystery of humanity – how it can be capable of the gentlest of nurture and also the cruellest of barbarism (usually described, in a word that flatters to deceive, as “inhumanity”). People often become attached to animals because their human relationships have failed, for one reason or another. But so what? There are worse needs than the need to care. It’s often forgotten that loving and caring is more important to humans than being loved and cared for. As I say, little is known of the fish-saving man. But, whatever his motives, he chose to save a tiny life because it was within his means to do so. That’s a sweet thing, even if it was way down at the extremely modest end of heroic. He and the team of fish-surgeons he’d hired may not have saved much, but they saved the fish. I don’t know about anyone else, but when I think about this country’s problems and this world’s problems, it makes me feel utterly overwhelmed, utterly powerless, even though I know that it’s this that makes us vulnerable to those who flush away human lives, let alone fish lives, and call it “leadership”. So, I’m going to choose to see this story as important and heartwarming, a reminder that when people have the opportunity to do something positive, they very often take it, even if it seems ridiculous or futile to others, even when it actually is ridiculous or futile. The year ahead is going to be a hard one, full of bad news. But whenever I start feeling as if things are too awful and depressing to bear, I’m going to remind myself of the lucky goldfish that was lavished with human care. I’m going to remind myself that if we are tender enough to see a pet fish as having a life worth living, then we are surely tender enough to find a way to care decently for each other. Happy new year.",profile/deborah-orr,Deborah,Orr

Cuomo led New York from 1983 to 1994. His profile extended far beyond the Empire State, thanks in part to a famous speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention and his own dramatic deliberations over whether to run for the White House. He never did run for president – pundits have been asking “what if” ever since – but on Thursday commanders in chief paid tribute, along with senators, governors and writers.  President Barack Obama “Michelle and I were saddened to learn of the passing of former New York governor Mario Cuomo. An Italian Catholic kid from Queens, born to immigrant parents, Mario paired his faith in God and faith in America to live a life of public service – and we are all better for it. He rose to be chief executive of the state he loved, a determined champion of progressive values and an unflinching voice for tolerance, inclusiveness, fairness, dignity, and opportunity. His own story taught him that as Americans, we are bound together as one people, and our country’s success rests on the success of all of us, not just a fortunate few. Michelle and I extend our deepest condolences to Mario’s wife, Matilda; his children, Governor Andrew Cuomo, Maria, Margaret, Madeline, and Chris; and his family, friends and New Yorkers who loved him dearly.” Bill and Hillary Clinton The former president and the former first lady, New York senator and secretary of state – and presumed frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 – released a joint statement: “We are terribly saddened by the passing of our friend Mario Cuomo. Mario’s life was the very embodiment of the American dream. When he placed my name in nomination at the 1992 Democratic Convention, he said government had ‘the solemn obligation to create opportunity for all our people’. In his three terms as Governor of New York, he honored that obligation. It was Mario Cuomo’s great gift and our good fortune that he was both a sterling orator and a passionate public servant. His life was a blessing.” Bill de Blasio The mayor of New York City ordered all flags be lowered to half-mast for 30 days and said Cuomo “established the gold standard in New York state for how public servants should act, and set an example that the rest of us continue to aspire to today. He was a man who campaigned with poetry and governed with beautiful prose … As he would often remind us, the state’s motto was ‘Excelsior’ or ‘Ever Upward’. Mario Cuomo personified the idea of New York, always urging us to look ‘ever upward’. Excelsior, Governor Cuomo. We will never forget his legacy.” George Pataki  The former New York governor, who defeated Cuomo in his bid for a fourth term, said:   Our deepest condolences on the passing of Gov Cuomo a proud son of immigrants, possessed of a soaring intellect & a great New Yorker.— George E. Pataki (@GovernorPataki) January 2, 2015  New York senator Chuck Schumer “From the hardscrabble streets of Queens, Mario Cuomo rose to the very pinnacle of political power in New York because he believed in his bones in the greatness of this state, the greatness of America and the unique potential of every individual. From soaring oratory that stirred the very soul to painstaking coalition-building to advance policies and accomplishments, he was a colossal political mind and represented the very best of public service; he leaves an indelible legacy on the state he loved.” New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand  I learned from Gov. Cuomo's example & will always be grateful for his wisdom & generosity. His legacy continues to serve as a guide for me.— Kirsten Gillibrand (@SenGillibrand) January 2, 2015  Former US senator Al D’Amato  #mariocuomo was a tremendous New Yorker and it was my privilege to work with him. #giant #proud #italianamerican— Al D'Amato (@AlDAmatoNY) January 2, 2015  Reverend Al Sharpton The New York-based civil rights campaigner said: “We debated often, but he never would reduce our disagreements to petty personal grudges. He was a philosopher at heart that always saw the bigger picture. Even when we would engage in debate, I felt he was playing chess while I was playing checkers.” The press As Cuomo’s former speechwriter and advisor Stephen Schlesinger noted in the New York Observer, the former governor “charmed a coterie of New York journalists … they understood that he was at one with them in their politics and that he echoed their sympathies toward life’s struggles”.  On Thursday night, reporters who followed Cuomo’s career – some for decades – paid poignant tribute. In his obituary of Cuomo for the New York Times, Adam Nagourney wrote: “When invited to sum up his own life for this obituary, he characteristically turned to self-deprecating humor.  ‘People asked me what I want as an epitaph,’ Mr Cuomo said. He then reprised a line he had used many years earlier traveling across upstate New York, a fresh public figure displaying astonishing talent and obvious potential. ‘He tried,’ Mr Cuomo said.” In the Daily Beast, Eleanor Clift wrote: “Mario Cuomo knew where he came from, and he never spoke down to the American people.” In Capital New York, Terry Galway put Cuomo’s legacy in perspective: “Long before Bill de Blasio summoned the ghost of Charles Dickens, long before the phrase ‘income inequality’ became part of the political lexicon, long before shimmering castles rose in the Midtown sky in celebration of a new gilded age, there was Mario Matthew Cuomo, son of immigrants, child of the New Deal, keeper of his party’s conscience.” Finally, the New Yorker’s Ken Auletta looked back on his relationship with the governor.  “In the four decades I knew him,” Auletta wrote, “I tried to keep him at arm’s length. Journalists are not supposed to say this, but I loved the guy.”",profile/kayla-epstein,epstein,kayla

Wimbledon won both their League Two matches over the festive period and will test a Liverpool side now preparing for life without their captain, Steven Gerrard.

They are six points adrift at the bottom of the Championship and the Norwich loanee, Jacob Murphy, has departed in disgrace for mocking the team on Twitter. Villa, with several players out and one eye on top-flight survival, could be vulnerable. Match pointer Blackpool have not beaten a side from the top flight in the Cup since their 1-0 defeat of Burnley in 1976 Barnsley v Middlesbrough Venue Oakwell, Saturday 3pm Ref D Whitestone Odds Barnsley 7-2 M’brough 4-5 Draw 5-2 Barnsley – who have not played since Boxing Day after their previous game against Oldham was postponed due to icy weather – will be without new signing George Williams, who is Cup-tied after playing for Worcester City in their run to the second round. Patrick Bamford may play for the visitors after extending his loan spell from Chelsea to the end of the season.

Birmingham have picked up under Gary Rowett, who may rejig his side on Saturday and hand Nikola Zigic a start.

Wigan, marooned in the Championship’s bottom three, are without Callum McManaman and Grant Holt but the 2013 winners will hope to draw on their fine recent Cup pedigree.

Brentford are likely to reshuffle and the winger Sam Saunders could start. Brighton will also be much-changed, with the loanees Darren Bent, Greg Halford, Gary Gardner and Elliott Bennett all recalled.

Dean Marney and Kevin Long may also miss out. Nabil Bentaleb will be unavailable for Tottenham as he joins Algeria for their Africa Cup of Nations campaign in Equatorial Guniea. Otherwise, Mauricio Pochettino has the same squad available that beat Chelsea 5-3 on Thursday.

They lost to Luton earlier this season, 1-0 at home in September. The visitors expect to be able to pick from a full strength squad, with Paul Benson, Luke Guttridge and Alex Lawless all available.

They have goalkeeper Neil Etheridge available after his loan deal was extended while Blackburn have Jason Steele available as his loan from Middlesbrough has been made permanent, but Ryan Tunnicliffe has returned to Fulham after a 17-game loan spell.

Watford, for their part, have beaten Chelsea only once in 26 meetings in all competitions. Match pointer Chelsea have scored nine unanswered goals in their past two home meetings with Watford in the Cup    Florent Malouda was among the goals the last time Chelsea played Watford back in 2010, resulting in a 5-0 scoreline.

Simon Dawkins, Craig Bryson and Omar Mascarell may also feature. Scott Kay returns after serving a three-game suspension for Southport, who are 20th in the Conference with 30 points from 26 games. Match pointer There have been four red cards in the five Cup matches involving Southport so far this season Doncasters Rovers v Bristol City Venue Keepmoat Stadium, Saturday 3pm Ref S Duncan Odds Doncaster 9-5 Bristol City 7-5 Draw 5-2 Doncaster face the League One leaders on the back of three games unbeaten, and could play full-back Reece Wabara after he extended his short-term contract with Rovers to the end of the campaign. City beat their opponents 3-0 at Ashton Gate in the league on 13 September, and have asked Fulham for permission to field loanee Matt Smith, with fellow forwards Kieran Agard and Aaron Wilbraham injury doubts.

The hosts are in excellent form, unbeaten in the league since a 1-0 defeat at Macclesfield in October. Alan Pardew could take charge of Palace for the first time when confirmed as Neil Warnock’s successor. Palace will be without captain Mile Jedinak, who is with Australia at the Asian Cup. Match pointer Dover have played four times in the Cup already this season and have yet to concede a single goal Everton v West Ham United Venue Goodison Park, Tuesday 7.45pm Ref A Taylor Odds Everton 5-6 West Ham 3-1 Draw 13-5 The Everton’s winger Christian Atsu has joined the Ghana squad for the Africa Cup of Nations and Antolín Alcaraz is also out, suspended after being sent off in the Premier League defeat by Hull City.

The Wolves manager, Kenny Jackett, has promised to play a strong team against Championship opposition, although Kevin McDonald is suspended and Kortney Hause is Cup-tied. The pair met at Craven Cottage in the league back on 20 August – Wolves won 1-0. Match pointer Wolves have not won away in the Cup in London since they beat Crystal Palace 1-0 in 1979 Huddersfield Town v Reading Venue John Smith’s Stadium, Saturday 3pm Ref P Gibbs Odds Huddersfield 7-5 Reading 2-1 Draw 13-5 Grant Holt has gone back to Wigan after suffering a serious injury while on loan at Huddersfield. The manager, Chris Powell, will look to continue a good relationship with the Cup, having taken Charlton to the quarter-finals last year. The Reading captain, Jem Karacan, may return after a more than three months out with a knee problem. Match pointer Reading’s past four win against Huddersfield in all competitions have all been by a 1-0 scoreline Leicester City v Newcastle United Venue King Power Stadium, Saturday 3pm Ref L Mason Odds Leicester 9-5 Newcastle 9-5 Draw 5-2 Nigel Pearson was once No2 at Newcastle, even briefly serving as caretaker following Sam Allardyce’s sacking, so the Leicester manager will know what John Carver is experiencing. Carver would relish succeeding Alan Pardew on a longer-term basis but his Newcastle squad are ravaged by injury and, as with Leicester, the Cup is not a priority. Could be a bit of a phoney war. Match pointer Newcastle have had a player sent off in three of their past four Cup matches away from home    Nigel Pearson was Newcastle United’s caretaker manager in 2008 – seen here marshalling his players at Old Trafford.

Little hope can be found for the Owls in the last time they faced City at the Etihad Stadium – that ended in a 7-0 drubbing in the League Cup. Match pointer Sheffield Wednesday have failed to win any of their past 15 Cup games against top flight sides Millwall v Bradford City Venue The Den, Saturday 3pm Ref D Webb Odds Millwall 11-10 Bradford 3-1 Draw 5-2 The lower-placed side are arguably favourites in this meeting of Championship strugglers and League One promotion contenders. Bradford, whose striker James Hanson was a summer transfer target for Millwall, are unbeaten in nine games while Ian Holloway’s team have lost three in a row. Match pointer Bradford have won their past nine penalty shootouts in the FA Cup and League Cup – an English record Preston North End v Norwich City Venue Deepdale, Saturday 3pm Ref S Attwell Odds Preston 12-5 Norwich 5-4 Draw 12-5 Promotion is the priority for both these sides but one of the strongest teams in League One should pose a stern test for Norwich, who have moved into play-off contention in the Championship and have scored 14 goals in four games. Simon Grayson may give new signing Sylvan Ebanks-Blake his Preston debut.

Harry Redknapp may rotate his side on Sunday and the Blades must make changes too, with defender Chris Basham suspended and loan striker Chris O’Grady recalled by parent club Brighton. Match pointer Sheffield United have won their two previous Cup meetings with QPR – both times at Loftus Road Rochdale v Nottingham Forest Venue Spotland, Saturday 3pm Ref G Sutton Odds Rochdale 5-2 Nottm Forest 6-5 Draw 13-5 Keith Hill has done a fine job in charge of Rochdale, twice getting them promoted and taking them into play-off contention this term. They should threaten an out-of-sorts Forest but will be without the midfielder Matty Lund and the on-loan defender Jack O’Connell. Forest are missing the suspended Henri Lansbury. Match pointer There have been five 90th-minute goals scored in Nottingham Forest’s past five Cup matches Rotherham United v AFC Bournemouth Venue New York Stadium, Saturday 3pm Ref N Swarbrick Odds R’ham 3-1 B’mouth 10-11 Draw 13-5 The Rotherham manager Steve Evans described the FA Cup as a “wonderful distraction” this week despite facing an unglamorous yet daunting tie against the Championship leaders. Bournemouth must make a change in goal, however, with Lee Camp in for the loanee Artur Boruc, who is ineligible.

David McGoldrick, formerly of Southampton’s academy, is their star man. Yet Southampton, unbeaten in four games, have regained their spark. Match pointer Ipswich have failed to win any of their six Cup matches since losing 2-1 at St Mary’s in January 2010 Stoke City v Wrexham Venue Britannia Stadium, Sunday 3pm Ref S Hooper Odds Stoke 1-6 Wrexham 22-1 Draw 8-1 The 2011 finalists will have to do without Mame Diouf, who has gone with Senegal to the Africa Cup of Nations. They will have Peter Crouch available, after Mark Hughes rebuffed talk he might be sold this month. Wrexham have not played since Boxing Day after their home game with Forest Green Rovers was postponed due to a frozen pitch. Match pointer These sides have met 15 times before in all competitions with Wrexham winning only once Sunderland v Leeds United Venue Stadium of Light, Sunday 1pm Ref M Dean Odds Sunderland 4-7 Leeds 11-2 Draw 16-5 Talk about an evocative tie. This one transports you straight back to Wembley in May 1973 and Ian Porterfield’s winner for Bob Stokoe’s Sunderland against then all-conquering Leeds as well as Jimmy Montgomery’s double save. More than four decades on and United arrive as the Championship underdogs but will the Sunderland manager, Gus Poyet, once assistant to Dennis Wise at Elland Road, prioritise avoiding relegation over a Cup entanglement? Match pointer Leeds have won just one of their six Cup games since beating Manchester United in January 2010 Tranmere Rovers v Swansea City Venue Prenton Park, Saturday 3pm Ref P Tierney Odds Tranmere 17-2 Swansea 2-5 Draw 4-1 Tranmere have had a terrible couple of years, having been relegated last season and sucked in to a battle for league survival in this campaign. But they have lost only three times since Micky Adams took over in October and could spring a surprise against a Swansea side likely to include several fringe players.

They look ill-placed to improve on that record on Sunday as they are currently bottom of League One having scored just five times at home all season.

304,2015-01-02T17:34:42Z,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/02/mobile-phone-portable-cell-phone-revolution,"My mobile phone, the portable paradox",commentisfree,Opinion,The Guardian,"It is 30 years since Britain’s first mobile phone call was made. To think that until New Year’s Day of 1985, when that auspicious – or terrible – inauguration occurred, every carriage on a train was a quiet carriage. Today, I board a train and watch my fellow passengers setting out their stalls: mobile phone, laptop, tablet, then … another mobile phone – of which there are now more in Britain than there are people. But surely a mobile phone is one of those things you definitely don’t need two of. I am reminded of Keith Richards talking about Led Zeppelin: “If you can’t do it with one drum kit, you’re certainly not going to be able to do it with two.” Any assessment of the mobile’s impact would be replete with paradox. Mobiles represent freedom – unless the government, or a tabloid journalist, is snooping on our calls. Mobiles are a function of individuality; yet how can that be, if everyone is using them all the time? It is said that with a mobile you can never be stood up on a date. Or is it nearer the mark to say you can be doubly snubbed, because the person you’re supposed to be meeting has not only not pitched up, they’ve also turned off their phone? Perhaps the simplest way forward is to present a case study: the mobile and me. I was a relatively late adopter, for a journalist. In 1990, I interviewed the American comedian Steven Wright, whose slow-burn one liners (“I bought a decaffeinated coffee table”) I much admired. It turned out he didn’t have a mobile phone: they interrupted valuable daydreams. I bought that line of argument, and didn’t acquire a mobile until about 1994. It was a chunky Nokia obviously only a generation removed from the walkie-talkie. It came in a waterproof sheath, and when you took it out it looked a vulnerable and suspect bit of kit – as if you’d called its bluff. I didn’t take it with me everywhere, but I was a father by now, and when we had a babysitter the ritual was for my wife to brief him or her before concluding, “And if anything comes up, Andrew has his mobile,” at which I would proudly tap my jacket pocket. For years, my phone was little more than a long-distance baby alarm. Only once did it prove vital. When he was 14 my eldest son became dangerously ill. He needed to be transferred urgently from one London hospital to another, and I was told in the first hospital: “We don’t have any ambulances until two o’clock” (it was then midday). So I called a minicab on my mobile. My sons acquired their own phones when they were about 12, which was both reassuring and worrying. They would be regularly stopped in the street and encircled by half a dozen older youths, one of whom would ask: “Mate, have you got the time?” I don’t think my sons ever fell for this, but a naive boy who would get his phone out and say “It’s just coming up to quarter to seven” would not be putting the phone back in his pocket. I cannot keep in mind the benefits of mobile phones while actually using them – this even though I have written historical novels in which I relished describing the cumbersome message-sending of Edwardian England: cycle to the post office, get a puncture on the way, queue up for a telegram form, write out the telegram, ask the cost of sending, realise you don’t have enough money, walk over the road to the bank and queue up there, return to the post office only to see it’s half-day closing. Instead, I get furious when mobiles go wrong. At the moment, for example, my younger son’s smartphone is broken in such a way that he can call you but you can’t call him. Or at least, you can call him but he can’t hear you. Rather than get his phone fixed, he has developed a little patter for when he is called: “Thanks for calling. You think we’re having a conversation but I can’t hear you, so please send me a text” … which I submit as a textbook definition of passive-aggressive. I have almost got into fights several times when people have used phones too loudly near me. But who hasn’t? I’m not sure I should be blaming the phones, though. In Constant Touch, his history of the mobile phone, Jon Agar sets the rise of mobiles in the context of rising self-expression and declining strictures of state control and class inhibition. In other words, we’d probably all be shouting anyway. The mobiles simply provide things to shout into.",profile/andrewmartin,martin,andrew

(I’m not even going to look to see what the Daily Mail has to say about this.) But these headlines, and the stories, are just bollocks. The work, which is very interesting, showed no such thing. The stories are about a paper just published in Science under the title “Variation in cancer risk among tissues can be explained by the number of stem cell divisions” (here’s the abstract). The authors, Bert Vogelstein and Cristian Tomasetti, straight up tell you that their study explains variation in cancer risk, but it does not explain absolute cancer risk.  Basically, the authors had a neat idea. Cancer is caused by mutations in DNA, and mutations can be caused by, amongst other things, DNA replication. So, the more rounds of replication that DNA undergoes (i.e. the more cell divisions that occur in a particular tissue), the greater the chance of cancer. To test this hypothesis, the authors analysed data on lifetime cancer risk for 31 types of cancer, and for each one they estimated the rate of cell division. They then plotted these data against each other:    Cancer rate risk versus total stem cell divisions. DOI: 10.1126/science.1260825. Photograph: DOI: 10.1126/science.1260825.   These data suggest there is a relationship between risk of cancer and number of cell divisions. But it says nothing about the proportion of cancers due to cell division.  So where did this two-thirds ratio come from? It is the proportion of variation in the log of the cancer risk that can be explained by cell divisions. But this variation could be the same regardless of whether the baseline risk is high or low. For example, the depth of the water in the Marianas Trench goes up and down with the position of the moon, so this explains a bit of the variation in its depth. But that reveals bugger all about the absolute depth of the trench.  We can see this visually below: in the two data sets, x explains just under 80 percent of the variation. In the black points, x explains more about the absolute risk rates (about 75 percent). But it explains less in the red points (which is about 30 percent, as it happens) because there is much more risk (i.e. more cases of cancer) when x is zero (i.e. it has no effect). So adding some cases to that baseline only increases the total risk by a small percentage.     . Illustration: Bob O'Hara   So, what proportion of cancers are due to bad luck? Unfortunately it’s difficult to tell from the paper. The figure from the paper is on the log scale, and if we extrapolate the model to zero (no cell divisions), we’d see it assumes there is no risk of cancer.  How could we decide how much of the cancer risk is due to bad luck? Well, first, we have to decide what is bad luck, which is an entirely different argument. But after we’ve done that, the only real way to suss out how much of the cancer risk is due to bad luck this is to either estimate the rates at which people get cancer through bad luck, or (perhaps easier) to estimate the non-bad luck rates.  If we stare at the figure from the paper, we can see that this second strategy is used to examine one effect: that of smoking on lung cancer rates. The cancer risk is 18 times higher in smokers than non-smokers. Since roughly 18 percent of the adult US population are smokers (according to the CDC), this suggests that for lung cancer, about 75 percent of the risk is due to smoking (i.e. the extra risk due to smoking is multiplied by the proportion of smokers divided by the total lung cancer risk). I feel like I need to get all Ben Goldacre on you and bemoan the lack of scientific literacy amongst health journalists. I would simply suggest that the next editor of this newspaper insists that all of its health journalists (and perhaps all journalists of whatever stripe) read Ben’s Bad Science, which is one of the best explanations of how to think statistically that I have read.

306,2015-01-02T17:45:12Z,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jan/02/tories-election-message-middle-of-the-road,Tories position their election message in the middle of the road,politics,Politics,The Guardian,"On first evidence, the key message of the Conservative party in its general election campaign is that voters should stick with the safe and familiar path. The Tories’ first billboard poster in the fight for No 10 shows a long straight road amid bucolic English countryside under a tranquil blue sky. It reads: “Let’s stay on the road to a stronger economy.” The approach is in stark contrast to the attacking, infamous 1997 poster that featured Tony Blair with devilish eyes, and the slogan “New Labour, New Danger”. With the road cutting the image in two, David Cameron is pitching his tent firmly in the middle, just as the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, this week moved to seize the centre ground for the Labour party in a comment piece for the Guardian. This approach is in some ways reminiscent of Angela Merkel’s “Die Mitte” – the middle – slogan. When a country is divided, don’t sway to the hysterics of the right or the left, go with the middle. Amid divisiveness and in times of uncertainty, incumbent parties tend to remind voters of the need to place their trust in a safe pair of hands. But while Cameron is more popular than the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, he is no Merkel when it comes to trust among voters. The final Ipsos Mori poll of 2014 showed that 36% of voters are satisfied with the PM. Trust in the German chancellor averaged 69.5% last year, and even hit a record high 74% due to her handling of relations with Russia. The Tory poster makes it clear that Cameron will be keen to keep the economy uppermost in voters’ minds, something the prime minister has been clearly planning to do since warning in November that “red warning lights are flashing on the dashboard of the global economy”. Voters trust different parties to handle different issues. Labour is most trusted in managing the health service, Ukip is viewed as being most sensitive to voters’ worries on immigration, while the Tories are seen as best at dealing with the economy. That leaves parties with a difficult balancing act. They need to have a position on the topics voters feel are most important. But they also need to make the issues where they’re most trusted the more salient ones. Simply put, Cameron needs voters to feel that the economy is the most pressing issue. But here too he faces a challenge as the economy has been falling away as an issue worrying voters since 2010. Immigration is now the issue of most concern – and by some margin. 42% of respondents in December’s Ipsos Mori poll cited immigration as the most important issue facing Britain today, up five points on November. Only 33% mentioned the economy, unchanged from the previous month, and significantly down on the 70% the issue was registering five years ago. In 1980, trailing in the polls a week before an election, Ronald Reagan looked into the camera during a presidential debate, and told voters: “Ask yourself: are you better off than you were four years ago?” Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter and became the 40th president of the United States. The election in May though will be more complex than simply asking voters if they’re better off than they were in 2010. Although the roles of Labour and the Conservatives are reversed, we are likely to see more of the fearful warnings of returning to the past and calls for change that have characterised previous campaigns. The problem for both Labour and the Conservatives is that so much has changed over the past five years. Debates over the union with Scotland and Britain’s place in Europe remain divisive. Combined support for the two main parties is at record lows – and this same lack of trust has led to the current fragmentation among the British electorate. According to research by King’s College London and Ipsos Mori, this particular trend is unlikely to change any time soon. By 2025, only 24% of Britons will identify as supporters of a political party. In 1985, 51% did. Just above 30% would never trust a British government – of any party – to place the country’s needs above party interests, a threefold increase since 1985.",profile/alberto-nardelli,nardelli,alberto

The plaintiffs claim Apple’s advertising does not fully represent the total amount of storage available to the users and that iOS 8 made it worse, taking up a larger amount of space without informing those upgrading. “The defendant fails to disclose to consumers that as much as 23.1% of the advertised storage capacity of the devices will be consumed by iOS 8 and unavailable for consumers when consumers purchase devices that have iOS 8 installed,” wrote Jonas P Mann of US law firm Audet & Partners in a complaint filed in the northern district of California. The suit is being brought on behalf of two Miami residents, Paul Orshan and Christopher Endara, who claim to have bought iPhones and iPads in the last year advertised with 16GB of storage but providing less to the user. The pair, who hope to turn the complaint into a class action, are seeking $5m (£3.3m) in damages and a trial by jury. Mann said: “In reality, nothing close to the advertised capacity of the devices is available to end users. Indeed, the discrepancy between advertised and available capacity is substantial and beyond any possible reasonable expectation. For the devices, the shortfall ranges from 18.1-23.1%. “Each gigabyte of storage Apple shortchanges its customers amounts to approximately 400-500 high-resolution photographs.” It is standard practice for consumer electronics manufacturers to advertise the total storage capacity of their devices without disclosing the amount taken up by the pre-loaded software. But the plaintiffs claim Apple goes further by preventing customers from adding additional memory via microSD cards and by advertising a pay-for cloud storage service when storage on the device is full. Many rival manufacturers do allow additional memory via microSD. When the internal hard drive of an iPhone or iPad approaches “full”, a popup advert opens offering the purchaser the opportunity to purchase iCloud cloud storage, said Mann. “Using these sharp business tactics, the defendant gives less storage capacity than advertised, only to offer to sell that capacity in a desperate moment, eg, when a consumer is trying to record or take photos at a child or grandchild’s recital, basketball game or wedding.” Apple’s latest operating system update, touted as the “biggest iOS release ever” on its release, was beset with issues in September that forced the company to pull its health app and service. The iOS 8 update also caused connectivity issues for some devices, and was removed before being reissued twice with bug fixes. The biggest problem for most users was the size of the update, however, which meant that some wishing to install it on their iPhones and iPads without a computer were forced to delete large amounts of data from their devices before the update would download. The update then reduced the total amount of space available to the users compared with the previous version of the operating system, iOS 7, the plaintiffs claim. Apple has faced and defeated similar suits in the past, including one from 2012 in Canada that alleged the company misrepresented the amount of storage available to users on the iPod. Microsoft was also sued and defeated a case in California in 2012 over a similar issue with its Surface tablets. Apple has yet to respond to requests for comment on the latest lawsuit.",profile/samuel-gibbs,Samuel,Gibbs

They will be made to carry pensioners’ bags on their heads. And disciplined bus queues will be reinstated. Youths, and all the others who chew gum with their open mouths and a vacant expressions on the London underground, will be sentenced to a lengthy course on mental agility with the University of the Third Age. I also intend to institute a platitudinous, sanctimonious and apolitical prize to be awarded monthly to the most effective speaker in those disciplines. There will be much competition. Under my reign no one will be able to earn more than five times the average wage of a supermarket shelf stacker. A maximum wage is long overdue. Inheritance tax will run at 95% so it would be wise to get your wealthy relations to be generous while they are still breathing. And I will, of course, invite Pope Francis to come to the royal bell tent for a meeting with as many religious and non-religious activists as I can fit in. Straight, gay, male, female, black and white. The purpose will be to plan joint action related to peace, justice, equality andthe global trusteeship of our world.

A time of doom, gloom and crud weather, when the skies are dark and the wind whips your face at a terrific rate. Shielding your skin with a layer of coconut oil or duck fat might provide temporary relief, but the issue surrounding excessive lip-balm application is causing a minor furore among people who claim it’s addictive. Once you start using lip balm, much like smack or Tekken, it becomes very hard to stop.  The global market for lip products is vast, projected to be over £1bn this year. Marie Claire US conducted a survey in which almost half their readers cited lip balm as a beauty essential in the office; most of their readers picked it as their No 2 desert island item after sun cream. During a sketch in the Oscars ceremony in which host Ellen DeGeneres attempted to solicit money to tip a pizza-delivery man, Oscar-winning actor Lupita Nyong’o handed her a tube of Clarins HydraQuench lip balm in lieu of payment, a move which created the hashtag #Lupitaslipbalm and prompted sales to rocket.  Lip balms work by sealing in moisture, thus preventing evaporation into the cold air. In theory, they should act like a moisturiser. But in theory, according to Dr Joshua Zeichner, a New York-based dermatologist who spoke to Refinery 29, “lips are able to repair themselves and maintain hydration” and our continued use of them might be doing more harm than good. So why do we keep using them? Mass application suggests they contain addictive properties, but the truth is they aren’t actually addictive. The main issue lies within the ingredients, a mixture of exfoliants (which remove dead skin) and emolients, which soften the skin, from salicylic acid to camphor, phenol, and menthol which can soothe lips but also, says Dr Zeichner, irritate them.  While lip balm isn’t addictive in the actual, traditional sense because it doesn’t contain ingredients which generally cause physiological dependency – a spokesperson from mental health charity Mind said it’s not something they’ve come across – compulsive application is “a thing” and tantamount to an OCD. As Joel Rose, director of OCD Action, explains “the minute you define it it becomes a thing, the compulsion becomes real”. And if you like to apply lip balm 70 times a day, then you may be displaying compulsive tendencies. The very nature of a compulsive disorder means that it can be anything. But while addiction is about getting stimulation, compulsion is more about soothing. The beauty in underlining the more colourful forms of OCD is that you legitimise them, allow issues to be issues ergo be taken seriously. Whats more, says Rose, “there are an infinite number of compulsions. Some people need to turn off the light switch 10 times before they go to bed, others nine times and others 14”. The multiple application of lip balm falls under the compulsive category, but like nail-biting it’s more of a habit “or habit disorder – wherein you are compelled to do something, for reasons you don’t know or understand. But if this behaviour is having an impact on your life then it should be taken seriously – you can and should seek help”.  One place is Lip Balm Anonymous, a self-help site run by “Kevin C” a former Chapstick “addict” has been floating around the internet fairly inactively since the mid nineties, acting as a forum for people to share their stories in a bid to ease the stigma surrounding their anxiety. You may laugh, but as one anonymous member explains: “I’ve been fired from my job at the call center. Every time I pick up the phone, I smear Chapstick on my face and the telephone. Struggling with this problem for all of my life has led me to accept that a day without [lip balm] could kill me. After trying to go cold turkey last week, I found myself running to a store at 2am, unable to bear it any longer.” Another user, Debbie, explains how she’s been using lip balm for 40 years and at last posting, had 20 tubes on her person. Kevin C’s answer? A 12-step-recovery plan. Of course this doesn’t suggest lip balm is necessarily dangerous. Chapped lips, and skin complaints are very real. Lip eczema, for example, is a serious and painful issue which can be helped by applying shea butter, petroleum (Vaseline, essentially) and Corticosteroids. Lip Balm Anonymous, meanwhile, suggest EOS balm, which uses natural non-drying ingredients. While no one was available to comment from Lip Balm Anonymous, in defence to queries surrounding its addictiveness, the site hosts the following disclaimer: “We use the substance habitually, often not realising we were actually applying it, since it was such a daily routine. Anyone who has tried to quit can readily attest that when you stop using, your lips become negatively affected for several days or weeks.” Further proof can be found on Facebook which over the years has played host to numerous “crackstick” groups. Rose surmises that while we should be careful with classifying it as an addiction because “there is a danger in playing fast and loose with language” and comparing it to something more serious devalues the latter’s currency, equally we should be aware of the difference between nothing and a compulsion. “Someone who applies a lot of lip balm might be considered quirky but for some people, compulsion can be very damaging on their lives.” Are you one of those people who applies it multiple times a day? Yes. Do your lips still feel chapped? Yes. And yet do you continue to apply it despite evidence suggesting it’s not helping? Yes. Then you might have a problem.",profile/morwennaferrier,Morwenna,Ferrier

You see a lot of them in stores at railway stations, especially, but rarely on the actual trains: I don’t know about you, but I haven’t seen many people in coach D, swigging chianti or claret with their Big Mac. As you’d expect, smaller bottles appeal mainly to singles, especially health-conscious under-35s and older consumers who want to treat themselves, much as they might with a box of chocolates. The ranges are pretty limited, though – retailers clearly take a “greatest hits” approach to wines in this size – nor are they particularly cheap, pro rata: a 25cl bottle of Marks & Spencer Petit Chablis, say, will set you back £5, while the standard 75cl bottle is only £10. But, continuing last week’s theme, they are a good way to limit your alcohol intake, in a similar way to a calorie-counted ready-meal. The two main players on the mini front are Marks & Spencer and Sainsbury’s, whose sales have risen 25% in the past year. Sainsbury’s generally does the better job, with more variety and a bottle size (187ml) that keeps us women under our recommended maximum units per day. M&S favours 250ml bottles, which seem to work on the assumption you’ll dutifully drink half the bottle and save the rest for the next day. I doubt that’s going to happen in most instances. I tasted a selection the other week, and it was nowhere near as dispiriting a task as I’d feared. From Sainsbury’s, I’d happily – well, fairly happily – buy the smooth, mellow Taste the Difference Vinedos Barrihuelo Rioja 2009 (£2.25, 13.5% abv, 2.5 units per bottle) and the dark, brambly Taste the Difference Primitivo Salento 2013 (£2.25, 13% abv, 2.4 units), while Marks’s smooth, creamy White Burgundy (£3.50, 12.5% abv, 3.1 units) would hit the spot with ready-made fish pie. Both prosecco and champagne look particularly dinky in mini bottles, but they do not work out cheap, in the case of champagne in particular. I’d balk at paying M&S £8 for a 20cl bottle of Desroches when the full-size bottle is £19 at the moment (down from £28). Brands on the whole don’t do much in the way of minis, but Concha y Toro’s ripe, blackcurranty Casillero del Diablo Cabernet Sauvignon 2013 (13.5% abv) and passionfruit-streaked Sauvignon Blanc 2014 (13% abv) actually make rather good drinking – both come in 185ml bottles and cost around £2.25 in selected branches of Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s. If nothing else, that’s proof one shouldn’t pre-judge big brands.

Major coup if Stevie goes to Hollywood,football,Football,The Guardian,"If Steven Gerrard’s post-Liverpool future lies in Major League Soccer, there will be no shortage of clubs – with LA Galaxy leading the line – interested in securing the 34-year-old midfielder for the final years of his career. Liverpool have sold out stadiums in the United States on friendly visits and Premier League television coverage is attracting growing audiences. The acquisition of Gerrard would be a major coup for the MLS as it heads into its 20th season. The MLS is growing nicely — attendances and interest are on the rise and the standard of play is gradually improving – but the league has lost some of its stellar appeal in the past few months and Gerrard would fit the bill as a name capable of generating excitement. While MLS has a salary cap, the Beckham Rule allows for three designated players whose salaries do not count fully against the cap and who can be paid lucrative deals. Finding the right players who can still perform at a good level has not been easy. Thierry Henry, the biggest name in the league since David Beckham left Galaxy in 2012, ended his four and a half years with New York Red Bulls in November and Landon Donovan, the league’s best known American player, has also retired. Toronto hoped Jermain Defoe would boost their profile and performance but he is now looking to return to England after a disappointing spell with the Canadian club. Orlando City have signed the Brazilian Kaká, formerly of Milan and Real Madrid, and New York City, who join the league this year, have signed the former Spain and Barcelona striker David Villa but the Frank Lampard signing seems to have backfired. The protracted Lampard affair has left a bitter taste for many American fans and means there may be wariness about bringing in another English player near the end of his career but Liverpool’s huge fan base in North America makes Gerrard an attractive proposition. Gerrard may not have the mainstream media appeal of Beckham but his widely respected attitude to the game and leadership skills would appeal to MLS clubs who also expect their designated players to act as mentors to American youngsters and be ambassadors for the club. Beckham’s former club Galaxy have been the most strongly linked with Gerrard. The MLS champions are in the market for a big-name signing given the Irish striker Robbie Keane is their last remaining well-known foreign player and he is in the final year of his contract. The Galaxy coach and general manager Bruce Arena, who had dismissed rumours of a Gerrard move to Los Angeles, responded with a “no comment” to the LA Times when asked about possible negotiations while the club president, Chris Klein, added: “We don’t have anything yet. We don’t comment on players that are not with our club. We’ve been pretty consistent with that all along.” The club, owned by the entertainment giants AEG, showed with their signing of Beckham they have the cash to spend on top players. While Beckham made Galaxy the glamour team of MLS, they will face a new challenge in 2017 when a heavily financed second LA team joins the league and the recruitment of Gerrard would help them tackle the risk of being overshadowed by big-spending new neighbours. If Toronto can free up Defoe’s $6.18m (£4.01m) a year wages they might be able to tempt Gerrard. The Seattle Sounders are MLS’s best supported club with an average attendance of 43,734 last season and have the former Fulham and Tottenham forward Clint Dempsey and the former Newcastle Nigeria international Obafemi Martins in their lineup but their artificial surface could be a deterrent. If Gerrard does make the move to MLS he is unlikely to be the only European player heading in that direction. Keane said recently he regularly receives calls from players asking about opportunities in the States. “There a lot of players that I know personally, big players, who want to come now. I can’t tell you who they are but it tells me how far this league has come,” he said. An MLS spokesman declined to comment on the reports linking Gerrard with a move to one of its clubs but said: “Steven Gerrard is a world-class player and soccer fans throughout the world have admired his talents for many years.”",profile/simonevans,,Evans

Eschewing computer power for sharp pencils and tracing paper, father and son architect team Quinlan and Francis Terry are drafting classically inspired designs for some of the capital’s most prominent sites in a fightback against plans for hundreds of new skyscrapers. Working from offices wallpapered with copies of the Times from 1957 in the picturesque historic town of Dedham, they are the antithesis of their modernist rivals in central London studios. But their latest scheme confirms them as a spearhead of a growing movement for an alternative urbanism. As part of a bid for one of the most sought-after and prominent “super-prime” sites in the capital, they have drafted a gigantic apartment “groundscraper” on the site of the army’s Hyde Park barracks in the style of the Paris city blocks planned by Georges Eugène Haussmann in the 19th century. It could be the sign of things to come. David Cameron last month appointed Quinlan Terry to a government panel advising on new housing design standards and awarded him a CBE. With its stone facade and mansard roof, the traditional proposal for the site, which the Ministry of Defence is considering selling off, is the latest gambit in a broadening campaign against schemes for clusters of towers on prime land, maximising profits at the expense, critics argue, of human-scale streets and public spaces.    Quinlan and Francis Terry’s ‘groundscraper’ design for Hyde Park barracks as apartment blocks. Photograph: Quinlan and Francis Terry   The counter-movement’s key players include Prince Charles, who earlier this year made a speech backing a new wave of traditional architecture to help solve London’s housing problems; Paul Murrain, an urbanist and until recently an architecture adviser to Charles; and Nicholas Boys Smith – a former adviser to the chancellor, George Osborne – who has set up a lobby group against the direction development is taking under the banner Create Streets. About 250 towers of more than 20 storeys are being planned in London according to research by the New London Architecture centre, sparking unfavourable comparisons with the unchecked development of Dubai and Shanghai. Critics have identified plans for 18,000 new homes around Battersea power station, which include schemes by Frank Gehry and Norman Foster, as key examples of the trend. Developers say they are building high to maximise the number of homes that can be built in an increasingly crowded city facing a housing shortage, and modernist architects believe the traditional styles used by the Terrys and favoured by Charles are inappropriate for a 21st-century global city. “I think we have the hearts of ordinary people on our side every time, but not the politicians or the architects,” said Quinlan Terry. “That is sad because we have right on our side. Steel and glass don’t produce useful buildings that last more than 25 years. We are trying to create density in a grain rather than with a tower of 20 storeys and space all around it. If you look at Rome, Paris and Milan you have that dense urban grain.” There are signs the movement is gaining support from political leaders. Create Streets has lobbied the Treasury, the Department for Communities and Local Government and the Greater London authority, and earlier this year it worked with Francis Terry and the local community to propose an alternative plan to build hundreds of homes on the site of Royal Mail’s central London sorting office at Mount Pleasant. Instead of the series of apartment blocks rising to 15 storeys, designed by leading modernist architects including Wilkinson Eyre and Allford Hall Monaghan Morris, Francis Terry drafted plans for eight-storey classical terraces around a “circus” open space. The London mayor, Boris Johnson, granted planning consent for the modernist scheme, but asked for the “beautiful” alternative plans to be submitted as well.    Frank Gehry and Norman Foster’s plans for redeveloping Battersea power station – the antithesis of the campaign against steel-and-glass high-rises. Photograph: Gehry Partners   The Terrys’ Hyde Park barracks proposal has echoes of Charles’s 2011 successful intervention over plans to build housing on Chelsea barracks, when he torpedoed Richard Rogers’ plans by writing to the prime minister of Qatar, whose royal family owns the site. He rubbished the modernist scheme, promoted Quinlan Terry’s classical alternative and the owners sacked their architect. Arguably even more sensitive, the decision by a consortium of bidders said to include Chinese and Gulf investors to select Quinlan and Francis Terry on the Hyde Park site, is likely to be seen as an attempt to avoid similar royal disapproval. In the summer, the consortium leader, Bruce Rippon, said the scheme would be “something which would make future kings and queens be proud”. The Ministry of Defence is likely to invite bids for the site which is expected to fetch about £650m. A report by Create Streets said most people are happier, less stressed, are less likely to be victims of crime in conventional streets rather than large multi-storey buildings. It said they also find it easier to bring up children and to behave more sociably with their neighbours and that the value of property on conventionally designed streets goes up faster than large multi-storey buildings, and that the lifetime costs of large buildings are higher and they tend to be pulled down earlier. Boys Smith said Britain was in danger of returning to some of the worst excesses of 1960s planning. “London’s population is rising fast but our response, a second generation of multistorey tower blocks, many for social housing, is not the right one,” he said. “Most people, most of the time, don’t want to live in big blocks. We are concerned that in the long term the flaws in these large multistorey buildings will make themselves very apparent.” Create Streets is advocating popular and timeless architecture instead and says that while traditional and classical styles are not always the solution, they are often most popular with local communities. Prince Charles has spoken of his desire to see more mansion blocks, between five and eight storeys and told architects in a speech last year: “There is enormous potential in taking the mid-rise housing block and adapting it to tackle the demands of 21st-century population growth.”",profile/robertbooth,Robert ,Booth

The former Mainz manager, currently on a year’s sabbatical after stepping down in May, is highly rated as an innovative tactician with a talent for improving players in Bundesliga circles and would fit the Newcastle owner Mike Ashley’s desire for a gifted tracksuit coach. Matters are complicated by the 41-year-old’s insistence he does not want to work again until the summer but Newcastle may attempt to change his mind. Steven Taylor has confirmed that he ruptured an achilles tendon during Newcastle United’s 3-3 New Year’s Day draw at home to Burnley and is to have an operation on Wednesday which will sideline him until next season. Taylor, meanwhile, used social media to confirm suspicions that his injury was season-ending. Writing on Sportlobster, the 28-year-old said: “Gutted to say I’m going to be out for the season. I ruptured my achilles in the last game. Thankfully it wasn’t the one I did a few years ago. “I’ll have an operation on it on Wednesday but won’t make it back now for the rest of this season. I know what to do in the rehab from last time and will come back fitter and stronger than before. Thanks to everyone who sent nice messages, appreciate the support.” His impending absence leaves Newcastle light in the central defensive department and Carver is expected to advise Ashley that signing a replacement this month should be a priority.",profile/louisetaylor,taylor,louise

It will, say her collaborators Artangel, be a “mutating, multidimensional sound sculpture”, as Harvey, her band, producers and engineers work on the hugely anticipated follow-up to her 2011 album, Let England Shake. Harvey came up with the concept of inviting the public to watch what will be, in effect, an architectural installation. She said: “I want [it] ... to operate as if we’re an exhibition in a gallery. I hope visitors will be able to experience the flow and energy of the recording process.” Her studio will be a box in a wing of Somerset House in London that was once used as the Inland Revenue’s staff gymnasium and rifle range. Michael Morris, the co-director of Artangel, said they had been working with Harvey for more than a year on a project, which will help to demystify a process normally out of bounds to the public. He said: “Polly’s approach to songwriting and making films is very much like that of a visual artist and we got talking about how the process of making a record could be displayed rather like an exhibition and what that might feel like.” The studio will have one-way glass, so Harvey and her team will have no idea when they are being watched. “It will be warts and all,” said Morris. “There will be some visitors who experience longueurs, the tuning-up of a bass guitar, the integration of a horn section. There will others there when she happens to run through a couple of songs from start to finish. It is very much a lottery.” It is not the first time an artist has allowed people to see them at work – Serbian artist Marina Abramović spent last summer at the Serpentine Gallery in London where she was the work – but there is no precedent for a recording artist of Harvey’s stature to open themselves up in this way. “We have deliberately avoided using the word performance because we don’t want to build up the wrong expectations,” said Morris. “The truth is none of us really know what it will be like. Polly doesn’t know. We don’t know. We think we have an idea but I suspect we’ll be surprised when it unfolds. It is uncategorisable.” The project is called Recording in Progress and the collaboration may not end with the installation at Somerset House. “We will continue to help Polly try to reinvent the different stages of the record as it is released and promoted to see if we can have a different perspective on how these things happen,” said Morris. The studio will be installed in the recently opened New Wing of Somerset House, using space that has variously been used as an Inland Revenue staff recreation room and gymnasium and, around the time of the first world war, appears to have served as a civil servants’ rifle range. Somerset House’s director Jonathan Reekie said it was an exciting project for them. “The people who are being most brave are the musicians and Polly herself. It is an extraordinary thing to want to do. Polly will be just doing her work. She won’t be paying attention to the audience ... she won’t be performing for them and it will be complete pot luck as to what visitors might get.” Reekie joined Somerset House last year and the Harvey project feeds into his aspirations for the site. “One of the things I want to do here is to make it a place about artists making work as much as it is about us presenting work,” said Reekie. “I think that is something missing in the centre of London. It is a repository for lots of work that is created elsewhere but not much is made. “Our idea is to build up a community of artists and makers here at Somerset House who will complement all the creative businesses and organisations already based here. There is a real need. London is a great cultural city but we’re also in danger of making it prohibitive for people to live and work here and I think that is a real problem.” Recording in Progress will take place at Somerset House from 16 January to 14 February with visitors paying £15 for a 45-minute time slot between 3-6pm on Tuesdays to Fridays and between 1-3pm on Saturdays. Around 3,000 tickets were available for the event, all of which sold out within a few hous of going on sale, said a spokeswoman for Somerset House. It will be Harvey’s first return to the album recording studio since the success of Let England Shake, which won her the Mercury prize in 2011 – the only person to win it twice. In recent years, Harvey has established a growing reputation for writing music for theatre, collaborating with Ian Rickson for a Broadway production of Hedda Gabler and, last October, Electra at the Old Vic (pictured). In October she will publish her first collection of poetry, The Hollow of the Hand, a collaboration with the photographer Seamus Murphy.",profile/markbrown,Mark,Brown

The Unite union said 70 workers at the Barbour warehouse would go on strike in a dispute over pay and hours. Unite regional officer Fazia Hussain-Brown said: “We were hoping the company would come back to the negotiating table but unfortunately they haven’t. With a heavy heart, we have decided our workers will be on the picket line at 7.30am on Monday morning.” She accused Barbour of making no effort to reach a settlement, following a four-day walkout in December. The maker of the corduroy-collared waxed jackets favoured by the hunting, shooting and fishing set, has seen sales boom after the likes of Kate Moss and Lily Allen were pictured wearing Barbours. In 2012, the company made £18m profits on turnover of £137m. According to Unite, the company wants to introduce new contracts that would require workers to do shifts finishing at 11pm, while scrapping extra pay for antisocial hours. Unite is calling on the company to allow those with caring responsibilities or transport problems to be allowed to continue working a day shift at the industrial estate. The workers pack Barbour clothes that are sent to high-end department stores across the UK and around the world. Barbour did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but has previously said it was offering a “substantial pay increase” for the move to new shift patterns, which were necessary to satisfy customer demand. But Hussain-Brown accused the company of not negotiating ahead of a 30 January deadline, when workers have been told they must sign the contracts or face the sack. She said the striking workers faced a month without pay to make a stand for their rights: “It is a bold and brave decision that our members have had to take.”",profile/jennifer-rankin,Jennifer,Rankin

Those seeking licences to operate in the city are currently required to prove their linguistic competence by reading aloud a paragraph from a book and demonstrating they can complete a journey receipt. But now council officials have put forward proposals for a tougher test, in which applicants instead have to answer “normal conversational questions”, such as: “What do you think of the weather recently?”, “Where did you take your last customer?”, or “How do you get from A to B?” A council report outlining the different approach says prospective drivers should be tested around the service they provide. “The answers are not the focus. The focus is to ensure the applicant understands English and has contributed to a communication in English at a basic level.” The proposals will be discussed by councillors on Thursday. Khurram Shehzad, chairman of the Bradford Private Hire Liaison Service, told the Bradford Telegraph and Argus: “It is in the interests of the public, because some drivers may know how to drive but when they have a customer in the car they can’t have a conversation. “The public do ask for certain drivers. They say: ‘We want a driver that can speak English.’ You do get requests like that.” Councils vary in the tests they set for prospective cab drivers. Applicants without specific English language qualifications face a 20-minute telephone test in Dacorum in Hertfordshire, for example. This requires them to read several sentences from a printed list, repeat back sentences that are read to them, answer simple questions, construct sentences from fragments and answer open questions by speaking for up to 30 seconds at a time. Oxford council also wants documentary proof of a qualification if licensing officers are not happy with the English shown by applicants during appointments.",profile/jamesmeikle,meikle,

Losing the money was easy. Thirteen days before Christmas, he walked up to the counter, swiped his debit card and spent £500 picking the wrong numbers on electronic roulette. Eight minutes later he took out a further £1,000, which was immediately applied to the machine as credit. He burned through that in 39 minutes, and promptly spent another £1,000. Ten minutes later and he was back at the counter buying another £1,000 worth of credit. “I was in a fog. It was me and the machine. I threw it all away,” Franklin said, fighting back tears. “All that money was supposed to pay back debts. It was for Christmas presents. For my son, my wife.” The 43-year-old had lost almost everything he had saved in months of being “clean”. “I don’t need to be told gambling ruins lives. It’s ruined mine several times.”    Tony Franklin, whose addiction to gambling has ruined his life ‘several times’ Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian/Guardian   In person, Franklin appears a charming rogue with a gift for one-liners. He has been successful in business: as a salesman working on commission his biggest pay cheque was £13,000 in a month. He is now penniless and steeped in debt, having blown his and his family’s cash through compulsive gambling. Over two decades or so, he calculates he has lost about £1m. With a junkie’s urges, the only way to feed his addiction was a series of petty scams. He began in the early 2000s by bouncing cheques, then graduated to running up tens of thousands of pounds in overdrafts. The explosion of bank lending and “pre-approved loans” in the late 90s enabled him to be, at one stage, jobless but with £100,000 in credit. Franklin’s most profitable sideline was making about “10 grand a month” by buying mobile phone contracts, paying the monthly line rentals and selling the handsets. Franklin said: “I was exploiting a loophole in the telecoms’ company marketing plans. The companies wanted customers and were basically paying you to sign up. They only woke up to it when the courier company tried delivering 500 phones to my house.” All the money he made went straight towards feeding his gambling habit. Problem gambling like Franklin’s is now recognised as a health issue, especially given the rise in “hardcore” machine betting on the high street. Bookmakers are permitted four fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs), which allow £100 to be laid on roulette wheels every 20 seconds, in every shop. There are now about 35,000 of these terminals in Britain. In December, industry-funded research revealed rates of problem gambling are as high as 23% among some machine players. This, experts noted, compared with 0.4% for all adults. In April 2014, public health authorities on Merseyside were so concerned they recommended bookmakers should require anyone who wanted to bet on gaming machines to become “members” so that they could track their betting and prevent big losses. In a report, Liverpool Public Health Observatory revealed respondents to their survey said that they lost “time away from relationships, as well as their money, and [this] led to mistrust and arguments”. The report found: “Problem gambling can lead to problems with sleep, due to anxiety, and has a ‘ripple’ effect, as one person’s gambling problems can impact upon a lot of people. Staff who worked with people who had problems with gambling reported that their families were at risk of anxiety and depression.” Franklin said he has tried everything from abstinence to therapy to attending Gambler’s Anonymous. “I know I have to control my gambling, but we need medical help. This is an illness. Problem gamblers are sick and as with any illness I did not choose to be sick.”    Card receipts for the £3,500 Franklin lost in an hour in the runup to Christmas. Photograph: Martin Godwin/Guardian   While for some this line of argument is just a way of evading a gambler’s personal responsibility, many experts are coming to the same conclusion. In 2013, for the first time, the US Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders recognised gambling as an addiction on a par with drugs and alcohol. Luke Clark, who left Cambridge University last September to head the University of British Columbia’s centre for gambling research in Canada, said: “Behaviour addictions have a distinguishing feature … in the case of gambling the pattern is that addicts all report debts – debts which interfere with their day-to-day functioning.” Franklin’s gambling addiction began at 13, when he would steal from his parents to play fruit machines. He left home four years later after landing his family with “thousands of pounds of debts” by ordering school books and then returning them to the supplier for cash refunds to gamble. “Gambling has been a hugely painful part of my life. I have been homeless, living on the streets. It has had a huge impact on my family, my parents, my wife, my son. I lose control when I gamble. I lose perspective and often didn’t see the point in working when you could lose a month’s salary in an hour”. Eventually, things got so bad that he left the country – determined to start afresh in eastern Europe with his wife. But even abroad, with a good job after seven months of going “cold turkey”, he blew €100,000 on gaming machines and internet and mobile phone gambling. He now works in Britain and his wife and five-year-old son remain abroad. Although Franklin has gambled on every form of electronic betting, he is particularly concerned about FOBTs. “Roulette is an addictive game. It should never be allowed to be sped up and then put on every high street,” he said. “The machines are everywhere. I used to travel with my job and as a result just spent all day in the bookmakers playing FOBTs.” He said bookmakers should have a duty of care to identify and exclude problem gamblers. The industry said it now has steps in place, with a code of conduct that requires staff to intervene to stop big losses and limit the time spent on the machines. However, when Franklin was on his way to a Christmas party in December, he “lost his senses and popped into the local Corals and nobody stopped me from playing the machine, even though I lost thousands”. Campaigners say Franklin’s experiences reveal the code to be toothless – and instead ministers should act by cutting the stakes on the machines. Newham council in east London is calling for the maximum stake on the machines to be lowered from £100 to £2, and has gathered backing from a quarter of all local authorities in England. Matt Zarb-Cousin, a spokesman for the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, said: “The bookmakers have been trying to convince government that they can deal with problem gambling to stave off further regulation. But it would be frankly delusional to believe the training of staff to interact with customers is enough to address this issue. Limiting harm means limiting losses, so reducing the stakes on addictive products like fixed odds betting terminals is crucial.” When contacted, the Association of British Bookmakers, the trade body which organised the code of conduct, said it did not want to comment. Coral said in a statement: “The case has been brought to our attention and we are investigating as a matter of urgency. If we have fallen short in either policies, practices or action of specific employees we will take action but we must investigate properly as a first step.”",profile/randeepramesh,Randeep ,Ramesh
322,2015-01-02T18:40:42Z,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jan/02/frank-atkinson,Frank Atkinson obituary,culture,Culture,The Guardian,"Frank Atkinson, who has died aged 90, was an inspirational museum director who held firmly to the belief that a museum’s collection should not be limited by the size of its doors. Shortly after the launch of his brainchild, Beamish, billed as “the living museum of the north”, in County Durham, in 1971, he took delivery of Rowley railway station, lock, stock and barrel. This was followed by a tram track, a drift mine, a Co-op store, East Stanley board school, Eston’s medieval church, terraced housing, a fairground carousel, flocks and herds of local sheep and cattle and much else. Beamish, which pioneered the idea of a “living museum”, set an immediate record on its opening day by attracting a two-hour queue. It has since ratcheted up awards including European Museum of the Year in 1987, the year Atkinson officially retired after an operation to remove a cancerous lung. His support and, crucially, his ethos continued unabated, and recent developments at Beamish have included the reconstruction of an original coal-fired fish and chip shop and a bakery.    Recent developments at Beamish include Davy’s Coal Fired Fish and Chip Shop Photograph: Public domain   From the start Beamish adopted Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg motto, “of the people, by the people, for the people”, which was consistent with Atkinson’s own background. He was born in Barnsley, the older son of Ernest, a plumber, and Elfrida (nee Bedford), an infant school teacher, both of whom improved their lot, his father by building and letting a small number of houses, his mother by becoming a headteacher. Although uninspired by Barnsley grammar school, Atkinson was an eager learner. He was rapaciously curious, taking up fossil collecting at the age of 10 and becoming the youngest member of the town’s naturalist and scientific society. By the age of 16 Atkinson had decided on a museum career, but after taking a science degree at Sheffield and doing wartime service he worked initially at a coking plant. He spent weekends volunteering for Wakefield Museum and Art Gallery, where he eventually got a job as an assistant, and worked his way up to director.    Frank Atkinson’s flair for innovation was complemented by managerial skill and enthusiasm Photograph: PR   The seeds of Beamish were sown in 1952, when he toured Norway and Sweden and witnessed the success of “folk museums” such as Stockholm’s Skansen, dedicated to preserving traditional rural culture, which was founded in 1891. Atkinson decided England should have a similar museum. He prospered first, however, in the traditional museum world, directing three museums in Halifax – Belle Vue, Shibden Hall and Bankfield Museum – before becoming curator of the Bowes Museum in 1958. This astonishing leviathan, a 19th-century French chateau soaring out of the County Durham countryside, combined an outstanding French and Spanish fine art collection with substantial storage space. It was here that Atkinson first made his case for an open-air museum, and with a small team began assembling a collection of artefacts representing the recent social history of the area.   A visit to Beamish by Jack Wright, 2013  Seed drills and pit trucks arrived to join such exquisite works as Bowes’s 18th-century silver swan automaton, and although unlikely sounding partners, they shared a precious asset: the public loved them. Duplicates or replaceable items were put on show to be used and handled, an early example of today’s ubiquitous hands-on museums. As the collection outgrew the attics at Bowes, Atkinson took over an empty tank depot. In 1966, a working party was established with the aim of setting up an open-air museum “for the purpose of studying, collecting, preserving and exhibiting buildings, machinery, objects and information illustrating the development of industry and the way of life of the north of England”. Beamish Hall, with its farmyard buildings and administrative offices recently vacated by the National Coal Board, was soon identified as a suitable location, and Atkinson became director of Beamish in 1970. His flair for innovation was complemented by managerial skill and an easy, enthusiastic manner, which worked powerfully in the media. Not a credit-seeker, he nonetheless became the figurehead for Beamish through the quality of his interviews and broadcasts. He retained his boyish curiosity, attending evening classes on computing in its early days, after asking an engineering friend what use the unfamiliar gadgets had and being told that they might improve the management of Newcastle upon Tyne’s traffic lights. In fact, his own programming ensured far-sighted systems at Beamish, including early monitoring of visitors’ origins and views of their day out.   The Man Who Made Beamish, BBC2, 1986  Atkinson was a devoted family man, marrying Joan Pierson in 1953, after she was appointed a junior assistant to Halifax’s museum service. The couple settled with their three sons in Ovingham, Northumberland, where he worked after retirement with the Thomas Bewick Birthplace Trust and as a member of the national Museums and Galleries Commission, since disbanded. He was awarded the CBE in 1995 and was an honorary doctor of civil law at Durham University. He wrote enthusiastically on subjects as varied as his collections, from the history of nail-making to descriptions of potholes investigated while caving, one of his main interests outside work and family. He is survived by Joan, their three sons and five grandchildren. • Frank Atkinson, museum director, born 13 April 1924; died 30 December 2014",profile/martinwainwright,wainwright,

Tasha Thomas died on New Year’s Day when the car she was travelling in struck a pole in Dayton at high speed and overturned, according to police. The driver, Frederick Bailey, died soon after at a hospital.    John Crawford III shows Crawford, right, with his mother, Tressa Sherrod. Photograph: AP   Thomas, who was 26, was shopping with Crawford at the Walmart in Beavercreek, a Dayton suburb, in August last year when Crawford was shot dead by a police officer. The officer was responding to a 911 call from a customer who said Crawford was pointing a gun at passersby.  Last month the Guardian disclosed that Thomas was aggressively questioned by police after the shooting. A detective accused her of lying, threatened to send her to jail, and suggested that she was high on drugs before telling her that Crawford, 22, was dead. “It’s just tragic,” Michael Wright, the attorney for Crawford’s family, said on Friday of Thomas’s death. “It is a sad set of circumstances continuing from what happened at Walmart.” Wright, who advised Thomas soon after the shooting, said that her death had been confirmed to him by Anthony VanNoy, Thomas’s attorney. VanNoy could not be reached for comment. An official in the Montgomery County coroner’s office confirmed that Thomas, who lived in Fairborn, was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash on North Broadway street at 3.06pm and that Bailey, 30, died at the emergency room about 22 minutes later. Police told ABC22 that the car was travelling at between 90 and 100mph. Surveillance footage released after Crawford’s death showed he was shot after walking around the store with the pellet gun and occasionally swinging it at his side. The shooting was investigated by state officials and handled by a special prosecutor. A grand jury decided in September that the two police officers involved should not face criminal charges.

Eloquently challenging conservative go-it-alone economics, Cuomo defined the Democratic Party’s credo as the shared obligations of a family: “We are bound one to another.”  Cuomo’s oration, which produced visible tears among Democratic delegates, may well have been the greatest American convention address of modern times. Certainly, it ranks with a defeated Ted Kennedy’s “the dream shall never die” speech in 1980 and the 2004 convention keynote address by a little-known Illinois state senator named Barack Obama.  Cuomo, who served three terms as governor but never moved beyond his flirtations with running for president, died on New Year’s Day afternoon at age 82 from a heart condition. Although he was one of the longest-serving governors in New York history, his legacy has little to do with what he accomplished in office. Rather he is mourned today because of all the hopes that he embodied for a liberal presidency that never was.  Just five hours before this towering figure in late 20th-century politics died, his son and more politically moderate heir Andrew Cuomo delivered his second inaugural address as New York’s governor. In his speech on Thursday, the younger Cuomo said, “He couldn’t be here physically today ... but my father is in the room.”  Unlike the old-money Bushes and the glamorous Kennedys, there was nothing about Mario Cuomo’s origins to suggest that he would launch a political dynasty.  Too Italian-American and too outer-borough Born in the depths of the Depression to immigrant parents from southern Italy who did not speak English, Cuomo grew up in Queens, a New York City borough filled with multi-ethnic strivers. He attended Catholic schools and then St John’s University in Queens for his undergraduate education and law school. Despite being tied for first in his law-school class, Cuomo discovered that he was too Italian-American and too outer-borough to get a job with an elite Manhattan law firm.  These slights from 1950s America stayed with Cuomo all his life. Practicing law in Queens, he gained a reputation for successfully mediating a racially charged dispute over the size of a public housing development in 1972. Trying to use his news clippings as a springboard, Cuomo lost a statewide primary election for lieutenant governor in 1974 and then was defeated by Ed Koch in the contentious 1977 New York City mayoral campaign.  The emblematic moment in Cuomo’s successful 1982 race for governor came in a televised debate when he called attention to his wealthy Republican rival’s luxurious gold watch. Even as he reflected the resentments of middle-class New Yorkers, Cuomo became known as a governor who elevated principle over politics. During a crime-ridden decade, he challenged the simplistic belief in capital punishment and vetoed popular legislation to restore the state’s death penalty. But that was pretty much all that non-New Yorkers knew about Cuomo when he took center stage in San Francisco on 16 July 1984. Making a distinction between the two parties that still resonates 30 years later, Cuomo said, “The Republicans believe that the wagon train will not make it to the frontier unless ... the weak are left by the side of the trail ... We Democrats believe that we can make it all the way with the whole family intact.”  In 1896, on the strength of a speech as powerful as Cuomo’s, the Democrats nominated William Jennings Bryan for president. But by 1984, conventions no longer had a will of their own and had become television spectacles. Which is why Democrats in San Francisco dutifully stuck with Walter Mondale, who went on to lose 49 states to Reagan.  With that convention speech and, two months later, an adroitly argued Catholic defense of abortion rights at Notre Dame University, Cuomo created a national clamor for him to run for president as a liberal champion. But Cuomo took himself out of the running long before the 1988 campaign and the Democrats went on to lose their third landslide election in a row as George HW Bush routed Michael Dukakis.  But 1992 was Cuomo’s year – or so the political touts thought. But the three-term governor dithered and delayed so much that he was ridiculed as “Hamlet on the Hudson.” On the filing day for the first-in-the-nation New Hampshire primary, with a plane waiting on the tarmac to fly him there to hand in his nominating petitions, Cuomo bowed out for the last time.  What if... Cuomo insisted (though it never sounded convincing) that he would have run if it were not for a budget impasse with the New York state legislature. And maybe he could have beaten Bill Clinton, even in a year when the Democrats looked south and to the center in choosing a nominee. But there was always the sense that the thin-skinned Cuomo, a politician who hated to travel, knew that his urban style and urbane rhetoric was not suited for a marathon national race for the White House.  Cuomo resisted one more turn of ambition’s wheel: In 1993, he allowed Clinton to seriously consider him for the supreme court and then – in characteristic style – took himself out of the running at the last minute. Instead, he stubbornly ran for a fourth term as governor in 1994 and lost to George Pataki, a little-known state legislator, in that year’s Republican tidal wave. The enigmatic and sometimes exasperating Cuomo had a long career near the center of American political life. But his true moment of glory came at that otherwise-forgotten 1984 convention when he defined - for then and now - what it means to be a liberal.  Walter Shapiro has covered the last nine presidential campaigns. He is currently a lecturer in political science at Yale University and a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU. ",,,

It has been emotional – not to mention glorious, thrilling and, by the end of a 16-year Liverpool career of operatic highs and lows, a little blurred, a little rancorous and above all strangely hard to classify. The temptation, it seems, is to reach for the big soaring notes here – and with good reason. Nostalgia is an easy chord to twang away at but, with Gerrard set to leave at the end of the season, it does seem a bit as if a golden thread connecting Liverpool to their glorious past is about to be decisively severed. There is a kind of parlour game one can play here. When Gerrard made his debut Steve McManaman was still playing. McManaman made his debut in a team containing Ian Rush. Rush made his debut alongside Phil Neal. Neal played with Ian Callaghan, who replaced Billy Liddell, who made his own debut alongside Bob Paisley, arguably the single greatest figure in Liverpool’s history and a central supporting joist of the glory years to come. Gerrard’s departure leaves Liverpool short of one slightly ponderous 34-year-old central midfielder. But it also plucks out the final on-field stitch connecting the club to this wonderfully lush brocade, a past that, with Gerrard gone, will become just a little more remote. Small wonder, then, that the temptation has been towards hyperbole, including a slightly meaningless suggestion that Gerrard ought to be remembered as Liverpool’s greatest ever player. If this is impossible to prove, or even to argue either way, there are some points worth making before it is even attempted. Firstly Gerrard is surely the only Liverpool player to be so much better than the mean level of quality in the team. The gulf has surely never been so large as it was on occasion between his own stellar moments of inspiration and the base note of grudging place-fillers in some of his more unsurprising teams, a would-be giant slumming it among the Josemis. Similarly his best moment, a major part in Liverpool’s run to the 2005 Champions League victory, is surely among the single greatest sustained feats of individual influence in modern English football. And yet at the same time here is a player who, in his most fretful periods, would have struggled to get on the subs’ bench in Liverpool’s best teams of the last half-century. Those great teams may have been more notable for their collective spirit, the primacy of teamwork and method above individual glory. But there are still some giants here. Is Gerrard demonstrably a better player than Kevin Keegan, who over six years was the headline player in three league titles, two Uefa Cups and the 1977 European Cup triumph? Has there ever been a better British central midfielder than Graeme Souness, who played 359 matches, scored 55 goals and drove his team on to five league titles and three European Cups? Souness also scored spectacular goals. He was also inspirational. His levels rarely dipped. Kenny Dalglish was the best player in Britain for several years: has Gerrard ever been this? Ian Callaghan played 857 times and was at Anfield through the dawning of the age of Bill Shankly, from Second Division to European Champions. Roger Hunt, lest we forget, scored 286 goals for Liverpool and won the World Cup with England. The point is that not only are comparisons impossible between different eras and different functions within very different teams but Gerrard is also only ever going to find himself suffering a crick in the neck gazing up at the Olympian pedigree of those who had the good fortune to play in the glory years. Beyond this there is also no single, fixed notion of Gerrard himself. This is a player who emerged as a coltish, buzz-cut local lad and who subsequently filled the roles of hugely promising tyro, midfield wild thing, world-class right-sided player, playmaker, midfield shield, club legend and all round heritage piece. Through all of which Gerrard’s basic longevity has arguably done him few favours. Not only have we seen an entire career played out in the same shirt, with all its associated dips and frustrations, but his time has been unavoidably tied to a period of decisive decline. When Gerrard made his debut, eight years after Liverpool’s last league title, there was still a whisper of empire around the place. When he finally goes those eight years will have stretched to a quarter of a century, with Gerrard the lone constant, a player whose gifts, connection to the club and moments of high-grade inspiration have been the consolation prize and enough still to twang that familiar golden chord. There is a case that being Liverpool’s most prized player has also not been good for him, just as having to provide so often some kind of frenzied, cathartic moment of inspiration has not been helpful. The most striking part of Gerrard’s goal in Istanbul 10 years ago is the sight of him waving his arms about immediately afterwards, lost entirely in the struggle, barely able to control his zeal. This was exactly the right moment to be like that; other times perhaps not so much. But this has so often seemed to be what was required. With this in mind there is a temptation to conclude Gerrard’s basic approach to how the game is to be played has been shaped by this sense of propping up the hopes of a club in a state of tantalising, occasionally defibrillated decline. His peculiarly frantic on-field presence has often been noted. Here is a footballer who has refused to budge from his hometown club but whose stasis has been accompanied by a ferocious sense of trapped energy on the pitch, who plays with all the calm assurance of a man attempting to repair a house that is constantly falling down around his ears. Players are often said to have a picture in their head on the pitch, but Gerrard seems to play with a series of pictures: flashbacks, snapshots, glimpses of some glorious alternative reality that, if he can just pass quickly enough, run a little further snap into a few more tackles, he might just finally catch up with. There is nothing much to be gained from describing him as the best Premier League player of his time. Among midfielders Roy Keane, Patrick Vieira, Frank Lampard, Paul Scholes, David Beckham, Ryan Giggs, Cristiano Ronaldo and one or two others all have a competing claim on a share of that prize. But Gerrard is still perhaps the most captivating on-field presence of his era, a player who more than any other seems to embrace the essence of a time and a place and a club. So much so it is just as useful to speculate on what he might have become in a parallel world where Liverpool had a team to match his talents, not to mention one good enough to punish his inconsistencies by demanding more. It is equally so to imagine what might have happened had Gerrard spread his wings and moved on as he might have in 2005. Those who remember that wonderfully controlled performance as a deep-lying ball winner, playmaker and goalscorer for England in the 5-1 defeat of Germany in Munich in 2001 can speculate as to what Gerrard might have become had the urgency, the fear, the pressure to resuscitate and preserve been removed from his game. All that really seems certain now is that he was a player of great, sustained moments of influence and one who will also be greatly missed for all sorts of reasons.",profile/barneyronay,Barney,Ronay
326,2015-01-02T18:54:42Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/02/rochdale-nottingham-forest-fa-cup-chris-dunphy,Rochdale’s church-heating expert hopes Forest won’t have an FA Cup prayer,football,Football,The Guardian,"Chris Dunphy’s refreshing take on how Rochdale should operate is best summed up in the song regaled to the chairman by fans at Spotland. As a self-made man whose business is church heating and who has written a tome on energy-saving entitled How Green is my Church, Dunphy’s acumen has proved invaluable since taking over in 2006. “Rochdale is an unusual club. We know fans have bought into it because last season they were chanting on the terraces: ‘Top of the league and paying our bills.’ They are proud of the fact Rochdale have never been wound up, not reinvented themselves,” Dunphy says. “You’ve got clubs nearby that have either disappeared off the map all together – your Darlingtons and Halifaxes – or clubs that wound themselves up and started again, like Leicester City, that wrote off £50m of debt, Bradford City, £38m. I’m not just picking them out [but] Rochdale have been trading since 1907.” Keith Hill’s team welcome Nottingham Forest and their beleaguered manager, Stuart Pearce, to their home for Saturday’s FA Cup third round tie and Dunphy is hardly putting pressure on Hill. “It’s one of those games that even if we lose we’ll have a great deal of respect. It’s not a must-win.” Rochdale have famously never risen above the third tier but are only two points off a play-off berth. Dunphy’s realism is again evident when discussing the prospect of reaching the Championship. “It’d be lovely but I don’t think it’s realistic for this season. We have a policy of bringing young players through the ranks. We’re not the sort of club who can afford to buy players and bring them in. We’ve got a low budget, low attendance, so we’ve got to constantly punch above our weight and we’ve done that quite successfully. Promotion to the Championship is achievable but I always think it has been a pretty good season if we’ve finished mid-table.” Dunphy has overseen some smart player sales that continue to benefit Rochdale. While not wishing to disclose how much Rickie Lambert’s summer move from Southampton to Liverpool was worth to his club – it is understood this was more than £220,000 – he does say of the striker who was at Rochdale in 2005-06 before Bristol Rovers bought him: “Lambert was the first person I ever sold. Initial fee £200,000 and there were add-ons if [Bristol] got to the Johnstone’s Paint Trophy final.” Dunphy has juggled the challenge of lower-league football finance with the day job of running Christopher Dunphy Ecclesiastical, which has been “designing and installing church heating systems since 1973”. He says: “There’s about 50,000 churches in the country – I know more about them than about football. We’ve probably heated close to 1,000 churches. If you’ve got a solid medieval or Victorian building you’re looking at walls that can be up to 2-7ft thick, so once you’ve warmed the fabric you retain the heat within the wall. They act like storage heaters. “The worse nightmare is if a church was built in the 1960s or 70s – you’ve got low heat retention. Give me a good old Victorian or medieval church.” Also give Dunphy occasions such as Saturday when the 64-year-old will again be at the ground he walked to when a young boy growing up in nearby Milnrow. “You’d get a gang of lads and you used to knock on every house on the way down,” he says. “My dad wasn’t interested in football and I remember opening my front door one evening and there were about 80 lads in his garden. He used the phrase I’ve never heard since. He said: ‘I was pudding-struck.’” Rochdale will be underdogs but Forest have not won a match since 22 November, with Pearce under serious pressure, his side having taken only three points from their past six matches. By 5pm on Saturday it could be Pearce and his men who are pudding-struck.",profile/jamiejackson,jackson,jamie
327,2015-01-02T18:59:41Z,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/02/smugglers-abandon-migrant-ship-italy-ezadeen,Smugglers abandon migrant ship off Italy in new tactic to force rescue,world,World news,The Guardian,"A “ghost ship” carrying hundreds of migrants was abandoned on Friday by its crew of smugglers in dangerous seas off the coast of southern Italy, in a move that a spokesman for the International Organisation for Migration said “takes the smuggling game to a whole new level”. The cargo ship Ezadeen, which set sail under a Sierra Leone flag from a Turkish port this week, was discovered drifting without a captain 40 nautical miles from the Italian coast. Italian coastguards were forced to intervene to prevent a disaster and possibly save the lives of the estimated 450 people on board, many of them thought to be Syrian refugees. “We are alone and we have no one to help us,” a migrant woman told officials by radio after the ship was asked to identify itself, coastguard spokesman Filippo Marini told an Italian radio station. Footage showed Italian officers landing on the Ezadeen by helicopter, before the ship was towed to Italy. The Ezadeen was the second vessel in four days to be found sailing without a crew. Earlier in the week, 800 migrants on the Blue Sky M, a Moldovan-registered ship, were rescued by Italian coastguards when it was discovered sailing without an active crew five miles off the coast. The two incidents have left observers of migrant routes in the Mediterranean fearing that people-smugglers have found a new and ruthless way of working in the area despite a recent decision to scale back Italian rescue operations. “It’s an extraordinary way to treat people,” said Leonard Doyle, a spokesman for the IOM, a UN-linked body that focuses on migrants. “The abandonment of ships in the high seas is a very dangerous thing to do at the best of times and takes the smuggling game to a whole new level that we’ve never seen before.” The tactic shows that despite the cancellation last autumn of Operation Mare Nostrum – an Italian-run rescue scheme that European authorities feared was a prominent reason why migrants were risking all to reach Europe – smugglers are still finding ways to get close to the Italian shore and force coastguards to rescue their passengers. Under the new system, ships carrying illegal migrants are supposed to be intercepted by a pan-European maritime border agency and prevented from reaching Italian waters. But Doyle said smugglers were now presenting their ships as legal entities until they were within a few miles of Italy. Then they disembarked, forcing the Italian authorities to intervene in order to save lives. “It’s almost as if [the smugglers] are playing chicken with the lives of vulnerable people – men, women and children who are fleeing war – and seeing who blinks first,” said Doyle. “But they know full well that the Italian coastguards will have to intervene.” An Egyptian ship owner involved in the smuggling business told the Guardian that his associates used similar tactics, and often left their ships in the hands of untrained charges “who don’t know how to sail”. “They only have GPS,” said the ship owner, who asked to be known as Abu Khaled, from a port on Egypt’s north coast. “Someone else starts the motor for them – and they follow the direction on the GPS device. So the driver doesn’t have any more sailing knowledge than this. He just follows the arrow. The GPS is the captain. If the waves become higher, they don’t know how to deal with it – so they just keep on going.” Some European politicians believe the answer is to create an even bigger deterrent than the cancellation of Mare Nostrum. Claude Moraes, a British MEP, told the BBC that its replacement scheme, Triton, “scares no one”, and he called for a new scheme that could be given the backing of a national judicial system. But others believe that little will deter the hundreds of thousands of migrants seeking to escape war and hardship in the Middle East. “Why do we keep going by sea?” asked Ahmed, a Syrian arrested while attempting to cross the Mediterranean from Egypt this autumn. “Because we trust God’s mercy more than the mercy of people here.” Doyle said it had been thought that the Mare Nostrum was “a pull factor, attracting migrants, and that by ending it migrants would stay on the other side of the Med. What we’re seeing is that whether or not there was a pull factor, people are still coming. There is still a demand from people who are desperately fleeing the Syrian war and who are looking for ways to be rescued and taken ashore safely.”    The recent activity of the stricken Ezadeen appears to shine a light on the demand for smuggling, even in the stormier winter months. Records show that the ship departed from Tartus, Syria’s second largest port, in October before sailing north towards Turkey. Then it sharply looped back south towards Cyprus. After sailing towards the port of Famagusta, in northern Cyprus, it then sailed north once again towards the Turkey coast before zig-zagging in an area of open water between Turkey and Cyprus. Over the past week and a half it skirted westwards along Turkey’s Mediterranean coast, according to records provided by Astra Paging, which provides software that tracks vessels using signals broadcast from vessels. The ship continued in a western direction to the north of Crete, changed direction and heading northwards along the coast of Greece before ending up drifting across towards Italy, where it appears to have been abandoned.",profile/johnhooper,John,Hooper
328,2015-01-02T19:00:02Z,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jan/02/labour-general-election-campaign-douglas-alexander,Tories to outspend Labour by 3 to 1 in general election,politics,Politics,The Guardian,"Labour is likely to be outspent by the Conservatives by a factor of three to one in the general election, the party’s election boss has admitted, but insists it can still win the tightest battle in generations through an intensive ground war built around local party activism. The message comes before a rally in Manchester on Monday where Ed Miliband, the party leader, is due to mount a ferocious assault on Tory plans for the health service. The rally is seen as the starting point of a campaign that will see Labour facing hostility in large sections of the national media and heavily outspent by the Conservatives, and so highly reliant on its superior organisation on the ground to bring out its vote in key marginals. Douglas Alexander, Labour’s election coordinator, writes for the Guardian: “The air war still has its place but it is on the ground where this election will be won or lost. Anyone who, like me, spent last summer in church halls and village halls, high streets and doorsteps across Scotland will understand this demand for dialogue. “The Tories may be able to outspend us by as much as three to one, but on the ground, in the key seats, we aim to outnumber their diminished and demoralised activists by the same margin as we fight this election conversation by conversation.” His article comes after David Cameron on Friday unveiled the Conservatives’ first election campaign poster on a visit to Yorkshire with the slogan “Let’s stay on the road to a stronger economy”. The prime minister said: “I say that we should stay on this road because I’m absolutely clear about what the destination should be, about what more we can do for our country over the coming five years.” The alternatives were “frankly … disastrous”, he said. A claim on the poster that the coalition had “halved the deficit” drew attacks from Labour, and critics said it was only true if measured as a proportion of national income. In cash terms, it has only been reduced by about a third. Alexander, writing for the Guardian’s Comment is free, also discloses that the Labour election campaign is expected to be built round a spine of five pledges. The first two, already announced, cover the deficit and curbing immigration – two natural Tory subjects. He reveals that the remaining three will be based on more familiar Labour issues: the future of the NHS, living standards, and the future for young people. The whole campaign theme is constructed around an economic argument that since the crash the Conservatives have failed to reform the economy so that it tackles inequality and delivers for working people. Alexander’s claim that Labour will be outspent by three to one is based on estimates of how much party candidates will spend locally as well as national election spending. In the 2010 election campaign the parties spent £31.1m, with the Conservatives accounting for 53% of this total (£16.6m). Labour spent 25% (£8m) and the Liberal Democrats 15% (£4.8m). But the Tories have raised £78m over the past four years, making the imbalance in incomes larger than 2010. Alexander admits that with little more than four months to go the election is wide open. Setting out the big challenges facing the Labour campaign, he writes that the established parties face an electorate that, as is the case in the rest of Europe, is no longer apathetic but angry. He warns: “The crowd may not be leaving the stadium, but they may be turning towards other teams who are playing a new and dangerous game.” Alexander writes that in spite of what he describes as “the rise of the rest in 2014”, the battle for Downing Street in 2015 “remains a binary choice between the change we need and can deliver with a Labour government – or more of the same failure that we have suffered under this Tory-led government”. Labour believes a shift in local activism from “no campaigning” to “average campaign intensity” leads to an identifiable increase in the party’s share of the vote. Its research shows that if Labour managed to contact 30% of voters in a seat in 2010, its share of the vote rose by over 5%. By mid-November, in its key seats, Labour had contacted over 15,000 voters per constituency, 21% on average. It hopes to have pushed that figure to 25% by the end of the year, and take it higher in the months before polling day on 7 May. Faced by voter anger, Alexander maintains that the answer does not lie in making outlandish pledges but instead promising clear and credible change. His remarks come a day after Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, argued that George Osborne’s autumn statement had given Labour the chance to become the party of the centre ground, resisting extremist and ideological plans to reduce spending on public services to the level of the 1930s. Balls has been helped in that attack by the surprisingly virulent criticism of the chancellor mounted by two of the Liberal Democrats’ leading centre-right politicians, David Laws and Danny Alexander. In what is likely to be the first battle of the long election campaign, Osborne remains confident that he has made the right call and voters are more worried by the deficit than the size of the state. He argues that if Balls is to vote for the fiscal rules set out in Osborne’s new code on fiscal stability, the shadow chancellor will have to give details of the big tax increases he will have to impose to get the current account into balance. The average of polls shows Labour with a three-point lead, sufficient to secure an overall majority of 30, but these figures do not take into account specific factors, notably the surge in support for the Scottish National party – now on course to win anything between 25 and 40 seats.",profile/patrickwintour,wintour,

This general election, in little more than four months’ time, will be the first I have fought without his friendship and constant counsel. But as a man who understood elections – and the emotions of the electorate – better than anyone I knew, Gould would have recognised how the challenge has changed. The issue today is not apathy, but anger: the crowd may not be leaving the stadium, but they may be turning towards other teams who are playing a new and dangerous game. This year will see no fewer than seven national elections across European countries. In every one, too many people feel they have been left out of politics and left behind by the economy. Here, Labour is engaging with the anger felt by so many in the only way a progressive party can. Not making false promises, nor pandering and posturing, but by letting people back into politics and setting out concrete ways we can change lives for the better. Under Ed Miliband’s leadership, we are changing both our party’s structures and culture. In place of the old command and control, “open source” campaigning involves a real dialogue with people, rebuilding Labour as a party rooted in local communities. When I first ran a general election campaign in 2001, my main focus was the election air war of posters and press conferences. The job description has changed. The air war still has its place, but it is on the ground where this election will be won or lost. Anyone who, like me, spent last summer in church halls and village halls, on high streets and doorsteps across Scotland will understand this demand for dialogue. So for Labour, this year’s contest will be a national election, fought locally. That’s why we’ve placed more than 100 community organisers in key seats across the country, more than Labour has had in any election before. The Tories may be able to outspend us by as much as three to one, but on the ground in the key seats, we aim to outnumber their diminished and demoralised activists by the same margin as we fight this election conversation by conversation, doorstep by doorstep, community by community. Our task will not be easy, not least because there are unprecedented levels of mistrust in politicians and politics itself. So the case we present on doorsteps will be concrete, clear and credible. We have already published two of our election pledges on building a strong economic foundation by balancing the books and controlling immigration in a fair way. Over the coming weeks you will see more, including on issues such as the NHS, our public services and the future of our young people. Our election campaign begins next week. And, while the colours of our political opponents might vary across the nations of Britain, the choice for voters in May is common. People can choose a failed plan in which the recovery works for only a few and a country where spending on public services is dragged back to the 1930s when we didn’t have the NHS. Or they can choose a better plan for Britain, one that rejects the notions that we cannot afford decent public services when money is tight or low pay is the only way that we can compete in the world.",profile/douglasalexander,alexander,douglas

Gerrard will be 35 in May and has decided to reject Liverpool’s offer of new terms. As a free agent he can talk to suitors – although the captain said he will not sign for another Premier League club. “This has been the toughest decision of my life and one which both me and my family have agonised over for a good deal of time,” Gerrard said. “I am making the announcement now so the manager and the team are not distracted by stories or speculation about my future. Liverpool Football Club has been such a huge part of all our lives for so long and saying goodbye is going to be difficult but I feel it’s something that’s in the best interests of all involved, including my family and the club itself. “I’m going to carry on playing and although I can’t confirm at this stage where that will be, I can say it will be somewhere that means I won’t be playing for a competing club, and will not therefore be lining up against Liverpool – that is something I could never contemplate.” Gerrard will have no shortage of offers from around the world but wants to one day come back to the club where he has won nine major trophies, including the Champions League in 2005. “It is a very special place to be part of. It is my sincere hope and wish that one day I can return to serve Liverpool again, in whatever capacity best helps the club,” he said.     Steven Gerrard and the FA Cup: watch five of his Liverpool goals – video  While Liverpool’s principal owner, John W Henry, and the chairman, Tom Werner, said in a joint statement Gerrard would be welcomed back whenever he wished, the midfielder has spoken of his ambition to become the manager at Anfield. “I want to stay in the game. If I’m good enough, if Liverpool came, I’d love to do that. It would be a dream to get that opportunity. The dream come true would be to manage Liverpool, when the Liverpool job becomes available,” he said last year. Gerrard seems to favour a move to Major League Soccer, where Los Angeles Galaxy head the American clubs who will be interested in signing him, although Liverpool’s statement hinted the midfielder may listen to offers from any team – as long as they do not play in the UK.

One of the worst is her assertion that “business in Britain” is regarded by Labour as “little more than the setting for perfidious economic crimes”. This theme, that somehow Labour is anti-business, will, I suspect, be a major line of Tory attack in the coming months. The most effective response will be to point out that it is not anti-business to be against corruption, profiteering, exploitation of vulnerable workers, tax avoidance on an industrial scale and those corporate forces that aim to undermine the whole democratic process, all of which have been catalogued day by day by our financial media. For those with Ms McElvoy’s mindset, however, these would, no doubt, be dismissed as “a few rotten apples” and the fundamental tenet that private business and the market rule supreme and must never be challenged will remain sacrosanct. Ed Miliband should take heart. If his tentative first steps into questioning the nature of current society have ruffled the feathers of Tony Blair and Ms McElvoy, he’s on to something.Ted WoodgateBillericay, Essex • In her latest depressing rallying call to vote Labour (2015 will be a year of political thrills – and colossal dangers, 30 December), Polly Toynbee argues that this is essential under our “broken” electoral system in order to prevent “irreversible damage” under a Tory government and claims that, if Labour wins, “Cameron’s dangerous alternative will be forgotten.” Surely the revelation of Thatcher’s ideas for removing schools from local authority control and the progressing of these plans under Cameron illustrates that the Tories will never forget their plans. What Toynbee seems to forget is the experience of the last Labour government, and the state of the Labour party today, in which any leftist alternative has been silenced. The last Labour government, if it had tried, could have reversed many of Thatcher’s policies. Instead, it extended some of them. Judging by Labour’s declared intentions, we can confidently expect the same under Miliband – more austerity, more attacks on immigrants, more support for big business and multinational corporations, more ignoring the urgency of tackling climate change. Changing the direction of travel won’t come without popular political action outside the Westminster bubble, but voting can help if people stop voting for a party with policies that will make things worse. Those are the wasted votes. Voting for the Green party or other candidates that oppose these attacks is unlikely to get them elected, but it’s our chance to show opposition, and the bigger that opposition, the better for our future.Peter WhitworthSurbiton, Surrey • With polls indicating an SNP whitewash destroying the “new” Labour party presence in Scotland, the Guardian responds by saying: “few could have predicted, or did predict…” (Editorial, 27 December). Actually, many people did predict this meltdown. When Labour was taken over by a privileged elite with an entirely alien ideology, it was inevitable that a social base unable to get genuine democratic representation would attempt to reconstitute itself elsewhere. It’s a tragedy that there still is a real Labour social base that is now permanently dispersed – into the SNP, Plaid Cymru, the Greens, Left Unity, the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition and even some lost souls into Ukip – because it has no genuine Labour candidates for whom to vote. The real question is why news outlets such as the Guardian did not criticise the entryist neoliberal coup d’état in the way they scrutinised Militant. The last Labour cabinet included two brothers and a married couple. Positions have since been found for the children of Kinnock, Prescott and Straw. Anyone who would have cared about these undemocratic stitch-ups has already left. Do they think parachuting Blairite Jim Murphy into the Scottish leadership position will help?Gavin LewisManchester • Ed Balls says a future Labour government would “get the deficit down in a tough and balanced way” (George Osborne is at the margins – Labour is the centre ground, 2 January). Here in Haringey a Labour council has just announced plans to cut its budget by £74m over the next three years by measures that are tough mostly on people, such as my son, with severe learning disabilities and autism, and others with dementia and other complex needs (who will bear more than 40% of the proposed cuts). If Labour is so obsessed with balancing on the centre ground that it is incapable of standing up for the needs of the most vulnerable groups in society, what is the point of electing it, either nationally or locally?Mary LanganLondon • With radical groups such as Syriza and Podemos poised for electoral success in mainland Europe, Tony Blair has appeared to warn the Labour party against being “too leftwing” (Blair doubts Labour will win next election, 31 January). Insisting “I am convinced the Labour party succeeds best when it’s in the centre ground,” he calls for “moderation”. To make his argument work, Blair is forced to overlook the achievements of Clement Attlee’s well-known “moderate” post-1945 government, which nationalised the commanding heights of the economy and built the welfare state and the NHS. If the Labour party fails in May’s general election, it will be because it is not leftwing enough and will peddle a watered-down version of Tory austerity, rather than an alternative to it. Blair should go back to doing what he does best – making Blair richer.Sasha SimicLondon • Blair owes everything he has to the Labour party. If he cannot bear to endorse Ed Miliband, because Ed’s success would show there was an alternative to the “third way” or whatever passed for policy under Blair, can’t he just keep his mouth shut? Whatever Neil Kinnock’s qualms might have been about the way Blair handled things, he would never have been so disloyal to the movement he loves. Blair, on the other hand, seems only ever to have seen the Labour party as a means to an end.Margaret SquiresSt Andrews, Fife • Many political commentators have never understood that Ed Miliband’s election as leader of the Labour party was driven by a rejection of New Labour, of which his brother David was very much part. Labour would certainly not have won in 2010 under Blair and, I suspect, would have lost even more seats. John BoalerCalne, Wiltshire • No solutions to the UK’s problems can be free from ideology, a set of beliefs that identifies what solutions might work. Blair’s genius was in presenting his chosen policies as a “middle way” of supposedly non-ideological, practical solutions, including support for the US in Iraq, or introducing PFI into the NHS. Nowadays, when someone talks about commonsense solutions, will we be wiser?Gill WestcottExeter • Thank you, Mr Blair. You have made it 100% certain that my vote will go to Ed Miliband. I hope your prediction has nothing to do with the proposed mansion tax.Phil JonesEastington, Gloucestershire • At last (Labour MP rails against leader’s ‘Hampstead’ politics, 24 December). Labour should find 20 more working-class MPs like Simon Danczuk and reduce the number of those recruited because they are “sycophants who cut their teeth as special advisers”, usually drawn from Oxbridge, it should be added. If so, I will return to campaigning for the party.Bob HolmanGlasgow • Tony Blair’s grasp of labour history was always poor – one suspected deliberately so – and seems to have grown worse since he left office. He may think that a traditional rightwing party will always beat a traditional leftwing one in an election, but that does rather raise the question of how Labour won the elections of 1945, 1950, 1964, 1966 and 1974 (twice).Keith FlettLondon • Neal Lawson criticises Tony Blair (Dear Tony Blair, maybe it’s your fault if the electorate hasn’t shifted to the left, theguardian.com, 1 January): “You were only concerned about winning, not about reshaping society, so who are you to say Ed Miliband is too leftwing?” Three responses (from me, not Blair): First, the prime purpose of the Labour party is to continue in its existence (reshaping society is a bonus): “Its purpose is to organise and maintain in parliament and in the country a political Labour party” (clause 1, name and  party). Second, New Labour’s 1997 manifesto specifically declared a programme for a “new centre and centre-left politics”. The draft was supported by 95% of the membership; the rolling programme was endorsed three times by a comfortable majority of the national electorate. Third, Ed Miliband was subsequently elected as leader on a platform that was distinctly to the left of New Labour. So that’s where we were, and this is where we are now. Remember, though, whatever the shortcomings of the New Labour project, it was undoubtedly one of absolute clarity, and one of total determination in delivery (the 10 key pledges were all well delivered). Of course, no one doubts that the political centre of gravity can change. But, as with New Labour, Ed Miliband’s Labour must also demonstrate a clarity that is not only ideologically unequivocal but also specific and measurable in its practical aims. As I am sure Neal Lawson would agree, a party that is quick to rubbish its own recent past achievements needs to be supremely confident about its present ability to predict and react to the challenges of the future.Mike AllottEastleigh, Hampshire • Anne McElvoy’s analysis of Labour is wholly enlightening, and a simple analogy may make things even clearer. Politics can perhaps best be understood in geological terms: there must be a firm foundation for what one might have to call the philosophy of a party. Above this are strata of elements, which may be mined or discarded as long as the core foundation remains firm. At the surface, or the ground or vegetation level, arrangements may be made to appeal on a temporary basis – pretty flowers, garden gnomes or juicy strawberries – as long as these are not mistaken for the necessary strong and supportive rocks below. If this bedrock is destroyed, the pretty fauna and the mined temporary materials will also start to slide and collapse. This can take time, but it is certain to occur. It remains to be seen whether or not New Labour was an ephemeral horticultural indulgence or if its gardeners – the Blair testers – accidentally toppled the whole geological entity. Let’s hope not.Ian FlintoffOxford • Why should anyone take any notice of Tony Blair? He was wrong about the euro and wrong about Iraq. He would have taken the NHS and other public services further in the direction of uncoordinated profit-seeking competition. He has shown no real concern about inequality, and still instinctively believes in discredited “trickle-down” capitalism. He has learnt nothing since the 2008 collapse, which destroyed not only a huge amount of wealth but also the foundations of free-market economics. New Labour is contrary to all that Labour has stood for since 1945, and offers no real difference from rational Conservatism. I believe the majority of the electorate knows this and has moved on – if not decisively this time, it certainly will after the next market meltdown.Alan BaileyLondon",,,

Cancer is a dreadful disease. If there is any painless and ennobling way to die, it is certainly not the indignities, the uncertainty and the devouring pain of many forms of cancer. As George Orwell asked, “What weapon has man ever invented that even approaches in cruelty some of the common diseases?” Yet the suffering of cancer patients and their loved ones can only be increased by the assumption that all cancers, or even most, have an environmental cause and could be evaded by living right. They don’t, as this result makes clear. We should be grateful that so many cancers are cured, rather than hoping that all could be prevented. There is something superstitious and ignoble in the attempt to attribute all forms of cancer to some cause that we could understand, as if fate were something that could be placated, and suffering only afflicted the insufficiently innocent. The victim of lung cancer is rather like the fundamentalist whose devout friends tell her that if she only had sufficient faith she would be cured. In both cases, blaming the victim gives their friends a sense that they have deserved their good luck. Yet for most cancers this is completely absurd. They happen or don’t according to their own laws and there is nothing that medicine or good resolutions can do to affect them. Even cancers that can largely be avoided by a change of behaviour – such as lung cancers – will still occasionally strike people who have done nothing to make them more likely. The research from Johns Hopkins University shows that the determining factor for most forms of cancer is simply the law of averages: what makes them most likely is the number of stem cell divisions in the affected organs. With each division, the chance of some small miscopying increases, and if these mistakes happen in vital places, cancer will result. It’s not just, and it’s not fair, but there is no reason to suppose nature will be either just or fair in its dealings. These degradations in the cell mechanics are the apparently inevitable consequences of the inherent inadequacies of the copying machinery on which all life depends. In one sense, they are just another part of growing old. All that can be done with such random cancers is to catch them early, and, wherever possible, to treat them. This discovery shouldn’t be a cause for despondency. It is also a liberating reminder of the essential contingency of life. The Traherne scholar Denise Inge, who died of cancer last year, said that the knowledge her disease was incurable did not make life more precious, but it made it more delicious. That attitude is admirable, even inspiring. Inge was a Christian but one who faced death squarely for the catastrophe it is. Since we all must die, it is ultimately fruitless to cling to life, but still possible and necessary to make the very most of what we have. There is no desirable way to die – death by organ failure is a ghastly business in a modern hospital, far too long prolonged. Death by dementia is something few of us would wish on our worst enemies. Sudden and wholly unexpected death leaves a crater in the lives of loved ones. In this context, cancer does not seem uniquely terrible. This is a point that should be made cautiously, since for anyone actually dying in this way almost anything else might seem preferable. But that is the view of Richard Smith, a former editor of the British Medical Journal, who argued recently that “Death from cancer is the best … You can say goodbye, reflect on your life, leave last messages, perhaps visit special places for a last time, listen to favourite pieces of music, read loved poems, and prepare, according to your beliefs, to meet your maker or enjoy eternal oblivion”. This is, as he says, a romantic vision that depends on love, morphine and whisky. None of these will be available for some patients and many more will not have enough to make their pains tolerable. It is also absurd to look forward to eternal oblivion when there can be no one to enjoy it. Yet it has a certain realism to commend it. Given the fact that death is inevitable for all of us, it is surely something we should prepare to meet with as much courage and grace as we can muster.",profile/editorial,editorial,

He was born in the New York borough of Queens, above the grocery shop owned by his family, illiterate immigrants from south of Naples. He grew up to be a professional baseball player; a lawyer good enough to turn down an offer of a place on the supreme court; a Catholic intellectual who dared to take on his church over abortion; a tireless campaigner against the death penalty; an orator who thrilled his party with one famous speech; and a politician who deeply disappointed it by twice backing away from running for president. In 1984, as the keynote speaker at the Democratic national convention that nominated Walter Mondale to run for president, Cuomo had the nerve to mock Ronald Reagan’s favourite image of America as “a shining city on a hill”. It was more a tale of two cities, he told a wildly cheering auditorium in San Francisco. There was another city, he said, where people “stared from a distance at the shining towers” of Reagan’s rhetoric. In the places Reagan did not visit, Cuomo said, people could not afford a mortgage; they slept in the gutter. The Reagan Republicans, he said, had divided America “between the lucky and the left-out, the royalty and the rabble”. And yet, for all his talents and his sincere radicalism, Cuomo was an enigma. People could not understand why he twice turned down glowing opportunities to run for president as well as a clear offer of a place on the supreme court. No wonder journalists called him “Hamlet on the Hudson”.    Mario Cuomo during Columbus Day celebrations in New York in the 1980s. Photograph: Zuma/Rex   Part of the explanation was his commitment to New York and a deep Catholic faith. Once when an engine in a plane he was flying in caught fire, he was imperturbable. “What’s the matter?” he asked a journalist flying with him. “Are you not in a state of grace?” Yet he infuriated the church with a speech at the great Catholic university in Indiana, Notre Dame, in which he equivocated like any 17th-century Jesuit confessor to royalty about the politics of abortion: ""God should not,"" he dared to say to that audience, “be made into a celestial party chairman."" There was even talk of excommunication. There were less saintly sides to that personality. He may have been, as New York’s liberal mayor Bill de Blasio said after Cuomo died, “a man of unwavering principle”. But no one ever said he did not know how to look after himself. The bachelor politician Ed Koch never forgave the posters in a New York mayoral primary campaign in 1977, proclaiming “Vote for Cuomo, Not the Homo”, though Cuomo always denied responsibility. President Clinton was embarrassed to be recorded comparing the New York governor to a mafioso and calling him, for good measure, “a mean son of a bitch”. He himself called politics “an ugly business”. Mario’s parents, Andrea and Immaculata, had come from the province of Salerno in the Italian Mezzogiorno to the Queens neighbourhood of South Jamaica. It was, as their son said later, “Italian-black-German-Irish-Polish”, a working-class part of New York, and Cuomo was a “lunch-bucket Democrat”, who never forgot the bread-and-butter issues that mattered to New York’s working class. He also never forgot the opportunities New York and America had given him. He went to St John's preparatory school, a high school run by the nearby St John’s University. There he was so good at baseball that he was put under contract by the Pittsburgh Pirates, who sent him to one of their farm clubs in Brunswick, Georgia. He was doing well there when he was hit on the head by a fast ball. He was blind for a week, and had to give up baseball: it was the best thing that could have happened. He went to St John’s, where he was first in his class, and then to its law school, where he was supported by his wife, Matilda (nee Raffa), a teacher, after their marriage in 1952. Four years later he was called to the New York bar and worked as a clerk to the head of the New York state court of appeal.    Mario Cuomo at the 1984 Democratic convention in Washington DC. Photograph: Rex   In 1958 he went to work for a Brooklyn law firm and had no involvement in politics until he was over 30, when he was successful in helping a group of local homeowners who were threatened with losing their land to the ambitions of the New York “master builder”, Robert Moses, for the New York World's Fair of 1964-65. Again in 1972, Cuomo successfully mediated a dispute about a housing project on behalf of New York mayor John Lindsay, and in 1974 he undertook his first campaign, for lieutenant governor. He was elected to that post on his second attempt, in 1978, helped by another St John’s alumnus and Catholic politician, the Democratic governor, Hugh Carey. It was not until 1982 that Cuomo ran successfully for governor of the state, and won again in 1986 and 1990. At first he was brilliantly successful, so much so that he was re-elected to his second term with 65% of the vote. In 1983 he settled a prison riot at Sing Sing, known at the time as the Ossining correctional facility – in contrast to the bloodbath at Attica prison, in which 29 prisoners and 10 hostages had died, under his predecessor Nelson Rockefeller in 1971 – and raised money for education through huge bond issues. Later, life became more difficult because, as he candidly admitted at the start of his third term in 1991: “We don’t have any money."" The paradox was that, though his presidential career prospects suffered because of his loyalty to New York state, he always did enough to keep his national prospects alive because it helped his poll standing in New York. In October 1991 he said he was thinking of running for president, but two months later, with a plane waiting at the airport in Albany to take him to New Hampshire to file for the key presidential primary election there, he decided not to go. Two years later he turned down President Clinton’s offer of the place on the supreme court that went to another New York liberal, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and in 1994, to his and everyone’s else’s surprise, he was defeated for re-election by the relatively unknown Republican, George Pataki. In the end, when asked by the New York Times what he would like to have said in his obituary he replied: “I tried."" They used to say that you couldn’t be president of the United States if your surname ended in a vowel. But it was Barack Obama, not Mario Cuomo, who first proved that wrong. In truth he did not try hard enough to be president. He is survived by Matilda, his daughters, Margaret, Maria and Madeline, and his sons, Christopher and Andrew. His death came on the day that Andrew was inaugurated for a second term as governor of New York. • Mario Matthew Cuomo, politician, born 15 June 1932; died 1 January 2015",profile/godfrey-hodgson,hodgson,godfrey

The attack happened shortly before 2am in the parking lot at Cal Skate in Grand Terrace, between Riverside and San Bernardino, where about 200 people, including children, were attending an all-night party to celebrate the new year. Richard Williamson, 48, a guard who owned the company providing security for the event, reportedly returned fire. He was hit and taken to a nearby hospital where he died. “I woke up, to my amazement, and saw muzzle flashes, coming from both sides of the parking lot,” Michael Marcoly, a driver who was sitting in his big-rig in the parking lot when the gunfire broke out, told KNBC-TV.  “I saw people scattering. It’s really hard for me to say, but I saw the security officer go down, and he died a hero. He saved a bunch of kids and families, no doubt in my mind.” Marcoly thought the melee was part of the event before he realised live rounds were being fired at the crowd.  “At first, I thought it was just people celebrating the new year, firing guns,” he said. “Then, when it hit my truck, it rocked my truck.” Two other men, including a guard employed by Williamson, were wounded. The men were ages 22 and 28; one was treated at the scene and the other was taken to a hospital. Their names were not released. The San Bernardino County sheriff’s office said in a statement no arrests had been made: “The suspects remain outstanding and investigators are asking anyone who may have witnessed the shooting to contact investigators.” The skating rink said in a statement it was working with investigators. “Our prayers are with the officer and who was involved and those who witnessed this tragic event,” the statement said.

339,2015-01-02T20:47:14Z,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jan/02/flu-season-epidemic-cdc-reports,Flu reaches epidemic proportions this season — but that's not unusual,us-news,US news,The Guardian,"Influenza has reached epidemic proportions in the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported this week, as 2014 ended with 15 children reported killed by the virus. Since 28 September, experts at the federal agency have confirmed 28,218 cases of influenza around the US. Thirty-six states reported widespread virus activity, 22 of them experiencing high infection rates and nine reporting deaths.  The south and midwest have had a particularly tough season, with three deaths in Texas and hospitals issuing warnings to parents in Michigan and Kansas. Only halfway through the flu season, the CDC predicts influenza strains will infect every state and US territory by the end of spring. It cautioned, however, that the 2014-15 flu season should not yet be compared with previous years.  Dr Michael Jhung, one of the CDC’s experts on influenza, told the Guardian there was no reason yet to believe that the 2014-15 flu season is unusual. “We are in an epidemic of flu, but we have epidemics of flu every year,” he said. The flu crosses the threshold of epidemic levels almost every year in the US, as strains mutate and the CDC rolls out new vaccines to meet the changed viruses. As of the CDC’s last assessment, the current flu season is at the threshold of an epidemic. “There’s a suggestion that it may be a more severe season,” Jhung said, since “the most common virus of this season, the H3N2 virus, has been associated with more severe seasons in the past.” Jhung characterized those H3N2 years as “moderately severe”, and said this season was shaping up to look like those years. But he cautioned that the flu season could change dramatically before the end of May. “The common line of ‘If you’ve seen one flu season then you’ve seen one flu season’ really applies,” he said. “Things could change in the next week or the next month, and we could end up with a mild season, or with a different dominant virus.” In December, the CDC warned that this year’s flu vaccine would be less effective than usual due to a strain’s mutation during the production of the shot. Agency director Dr Tom Frieden advised hospitals that the season could be more severe, since the vaccine, which covers several variants, is a mismatch with the virus circulating most widely. Flu seasons tend to be unpredictable: in the past decade as few as 37 people have died one season and as many as 171 the next. In only one year in recent memory has influenza reached pandemic proportions, when the strain of H1N1 “swine flu” swept through the US in 2009. That year, as in 2014, variant strains “drifted” genetically and antigenically – meaning they mutated to evade a host’s defenses – at just the right time to slip past researchers developing a vaccine.  The CDC helped decide what would be in this year’s flu vaccine in February, and production takes about four months; the H3N2 strain mutated just enough in March to reduce the vaccine’s effect.  “The vaccine’s different, but similar enough so there’s protection afforded,” Jhung said, “and it will still provide very good protection for the other flu viruses still out there.” The CDC will not know until April or May whether the 2014-15 season is worse than others, because deaths and hospitalizations are only two means of gauging a season and are reported slowly, and because the CDC does not require hospitals report adult deaths. For that reason, the CDC says it may simply be an unusually early season, rather than a more severe one.  This year’s dominant strain of H3N2, however, does “tend to have more hospitalizations and more deaths”, Frieden warned in December.  With months left before infections wane and a few strains well protected by the vaccine, Jhung recommended that people at risk – children under two, adults over 65 and people with medical conditions – quickly get antiviral medications from a doctor should they fall ill with the flu.  Such medications “work to prevent the virus from replicating in the body”, he said, meaning that the flu can be kept in check before it has a chance to overwhelm an already vulnerable immune system. Most children who die from influenza-related causes were not vaccinated, the CDC has found.  Frieden advised in December that preventative measures as simple as staying home would help reduce infection rates and be better for sick people.",profile/alan-yuhas,yuhas,alan

These include the price of single bus journeys being hiked to the symbolic height of £1.50. Ten years ago, using Oyster, these cost just £1. Yet 2015’s increase is one of the gentler adjustments of recent times. The average rise is 2.5% compared with the inflation-plus new tariffs Boris Johnson has previously introduced. Daily caps on pay-as-you-go fares have been lowered to help some of those many Londoners with part-time jobs or unpredictable work patterns. Such blessings may seem small in the greater scheme of things. But maybe we should enjoy them while they last.  The next twelve months will be a journey into uncertainty for the capital’s transport chiefs. The biggest doubt will be about the Treasury’s money stream. By autumn the next public spending review will be underway, including decisions about funding for Transport for London (TfL) until (probably) 2020. What species of government will be in charge? How long will it last for? And how will the mayor be passing his time by then?  By May, Johnson will be a Conservative MP too. By the end of the year he could be – although I wouldn’t bet too much on it – the new leader of the Conservative party and have stepped down from the helm of City Hall, leaving his statutory deputy Victoria Borwick in charge until the next mayoral election in May 2016. Would his mind have been concentrated on the task of extracting cash from a Labour-controlled public spending purse during those gruelling mud wrestles upriver with George Osborne and Theresa May? If, on the other hand, the next government is again Conservative-led how might Johnson have approached simultaneously supporting and quarrelling with its spending plans, especially if he had become a member of that government or was expecting to become one before long? It could all be a bit unsatisfactory and leave the next mayor, likely to be a Labour one, to cope with the consequences. Arguments for infrastructure investment that carried weight in 2011 will still apply as London’s population heads for nine million and beyond and its economy continues to subside the rest of the UK. But the bigger worry is the revenue support part of the TfL budget, which pays to keep things and people working and restrains fares from rising even more than they already do.  With deficit reduction on both Tory and Labour agendas, health and education at the top of the protected list and other big cities seeking a larger share of a smaller cake, cuts in this department could be bigger than already feared. That would mean extra upward pressure on fares to fill the financial gap. Mayoral pretenders promising to freeze them (for four years, says Diane Abbott) or even cut them (every year, claims Tory policing deputy Stephen Greenhalgh) will need to explain how they’d make the sums add up. Through more staffing cuts, perhaps? The unions – not to mention the public - might have views on that. Fancy disappearing some of the bus service, anyone? After all, it’s so much more shrinkable than the Underground. You’d start with weekend services then thin out weekday frequencies from there. Last year was officially the Year of The Bus. It was also, towards its end, notable for TfL announcing plans for 500 buses to be added to London’s fleet. Under Johnson, expansion of the service has been next to nil despite growing demand and in any case he’ll be gone (or as good as) when any fighting to change that needs to begin. The bus is the bedrock of London public transport, carrying 6.5 million passengers a day, twice as many as the Tube. It’s also the means used by the poorest. Hacking holes in it would be a calamity for the city, but if the pessimists are right it could end up being that or soaring fares. Happy days. In other 2015 news, traffic levels are growing, boosted by economic recovery and the growth of vans rushing consumer goods to Londoners’ front doors. Sir Peter Hendy, commissioner of TfL, wrote in the Standard before Christmas of the need to learn from the Olympics by encouraging more road deliveries outside peak travel times. The mayor’s flagship cycle superhighways will proceed towards completion, even if amended or slowed. Work on them is scheduled to start early this year. The political and wider consensus supporting them could hardly be more complete while their enemies, affronted car-worshipers aside, exist mostly in the imaginations of the more suggestible cycling activists. The case for new Thames crossings east of Tower Bridge will continue to be made too and for similar reasons, though how fast progress will be is much harder to say. There may be less debate about what sort of crossings should they be. A shame. It’s going to be a testing year. Keeping London moving (to borrow a phrase) in its booming future will require judicious deployment of available resources and a clear focus on putting walking, cycling and public transport first. How about a big name London politician flying the flag for more congestion charging in this general election year? Thought not.",profile/davehill,hill,dave

Despite some continued claims from outside the US government that the hack may have been the work of disgruntled employees instead, the White House on Friday followed through on its threat to seek revenge, blaming the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea for “provocative, destabilizing, and repressive actions and policies, particularly its destructive and coercive cyber attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment”. Following an executive order by Barack Obama, the US Treasury has designated three state-run organisations and ten North Korean government officials for specific actions, including the country’s intelligence agency, an arms exporter and a defence procurement agency. “Today’s actions are driven by our commitment to hold North Korea accountable for its destructive and destabilizing conduct,” said Treasury secretary Jack Lew in a statement.  “Even as the FBI continues its investigation into the cyber-attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment, these steps underscore that we will employ a broad set of tools to defend US businesses and citizens, and to respond to attempts to undermine our values or threaten the national security of the United States.” A separate statement from the White House added: “We take seriously North Korea’s attack that aimed to create destructive financial effects on a US company and to threaten artists and other individuals with the goal of restricting their right to free expression.” “As the president has said, our response to North Korea’s attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment will be proportional, and will take place at a time and in a manner of our choosing. Today’s actions are the first aspect of our response.” The US says its latest actions are designed to complement existing sanctions against these government entities that were introduced previously in response to nuclear proliferation and “illicit financial activity”, and not a sign that it believes these were specifically the agencies or individuals directly involved in the latest hack. Nevertheless, a senior administration official told reporters in a phone briefing that the FBI continued to be adamant that North Korea was to blame for the attack, insisting independent experts questioning its theory were limited in number and did not have access to the same information. “We are standing by our assessment,” said one US official. The White House also insists that the sanctions, though barring only limited further commercial engagement with the already heavily-isolated state, were a significant step because they were the first time it has retaliated for cyber-attacks against a company. Asked if this meant the US was effectively denying rumoured involvement in internet outages in North Korea last month after the Sony hack first came to light, administration officials refused to comment on any “covert activity”.",profile/dan-roberts,Dan,Roberts
343,2015-01-02T22:00:17Z,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jan/02/northampton-newcastle-premiership-match-report,Northampton’s Luther Burrell puts match beyond spirited Newcastle,sport,Sport,The Guardian,"The Premiership leaders were duly made to work hard for this win, especially in the first 50 minutes of the match, at which point Ben Foden and Ken Pisi took advantage of loose tackling to put Calum Clark over and give Saints a 15-point lead. Thereafter the result was not really in doubt, but in the first half, and in the final 20 minutes, the visitors demonstrated the extent to which they are an improved side this season, especially with ball in hand. After Northampton’s epic 14-man victory over Leicester, and equally sustained effort to beat Harlequins despite having only around 25% share of possession, their director of rugby, Jim Mallinder, will have spent part of the run-up to this game ensuring his players understood the importance of not falling off the pace against a side who arrived second from bottom of the table after losing four of their previous five league matches. Newcastle’s director of rugby, Dean Richards, after seeing his side score three late tries to secure a losing bonus point, said: “We have to carry on improving our game and tighten up on the little things, but there were clearly a lot of positives. “One of the pleasing things was that heads didn’t drop when we went a few points behind in the second half, and when we gave it a go the flair and skill really stood out.” Given Richards had made six changes to the side that had gone desperately close to beating Saracens in their previous match, however, perhaps it was not entirely surprising the Falcons were unable to sustain their effort over the full 80 minutes. The selection must be interpreted, at least to some extent, as a husbanding of resources intended to give themselves the best chance of beating the bottom side, London Welsh, whom they host on Sunday week. Saints, by contrast, made just the one change, Phil Dowson replacing Tom Wood in the back row and captaining the side against his former club. The England loose-head prop Alex Corbisiero, whose 25-minute appearance against Quins marked his return from the shoulder injury which has kept him out since September, was again among the replacements. Northampton’s first try was not long delayed, a handling effort of considerable quality begun by full-back Foden and involving the Georges North and Pisi before Stephen Myler looped around the outside to finish in the corner. Newcastle’s response was impressive and effective, a series of controlled drives pulling in the cover, including Foden, before the fly-half Tom Catterick threaded a low kick into the open Saints’ 22 for wing Chris Harris to pick up and go over. With the lock Josh Furno twice stealing lineout ball from a Northampton throw, the visitors were preventing the home team establishing any real momentum, at least until George Pisi seized on Myler’s clever grubber kick into the Falcons’ 22 to give Saints a half-time lead. Clark’s score ten minutes after the break, and the manner of its concession, saw another sell-out crowd at Franklins’ Gardens relax in anticipation of the floodgates opening, but although a penalty try awarded by the referee Ian Tempest ten minutes later guaranteed the bonus point win, the Falcons were far from finished. Two tries in as many minutes through the replacement hooker George McGuigan and then full-back Alex Tait, finishing a length of field move, made the score- line look very different, and though Luther Burrell grounded a fifth try for Northampton, the Newcastle pack responded by driving flanker Richard Mayhew over the line to secure a losing bonus point. It meant the Falcons have now scored 26 tries in 12 Premiership games, after managing just 23 in the entire campaign last season. “We had moments of brilliance in attack but I was very disappointed with some of our defence, it’s something we need to sharpen up on quickly,” said Mallinder. “Newcastle have improved, though, without a doubt.

In an interview with the German financial daily Handelsblatt, Mario Draghi said the risk of inflation failing to return to its targeted level of 2% had grown in the past six months, alerting markets that the central bank could announce further stimulus as soon as its next meeting on 22 January. The euro fell to $1.20, its lowest since June 2010 when the currency was reeling after Greece had agreed its first €110bn bailout the previous month. Eurozone inflation has already slipped to 0.3%, far off the ECB’s price-stability target of just below 2%, and economists polled by Reuters expect the single currency zone to have sunk into outright deflation in December. They forecast falls of 0.1% when figures are released next Wednesday, with plunging oil prices a major factor. Spain and Greece are experiencing falling prices and some economists are warning that the 19-strong currency bloc could become mired in a deflationary spiral that further dampens spending and consumer confidence. Oil prices fell to a five-year low on Friday, with benchmark Brent crude tumbling by 1.8% to $56.31 by the close in New York. Although Draghi said the risk of deflation in the eurozone was limited, he indicated the ECB was becoming more concerned. “The risk that we do not fulfil our mandate of price stability is higher than six months ago,” he said. “We are in technical preparations to adjust the size, speed and compositions of our measures in early 2015, should it become necessary to react to a too-long period of low inflation. There is unanimity with the governing council on this.” He said government bond purchases were among the tools the ECB could use to fulfil its price-stability mandate. Buying government bonds, a policy known as quantitative easing, is seen as one of the last weapons in the ECB’s arsenal to revive the eurozone, with interest rates having already been knocked down to 0.05%. Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank, said Draghi’s words signalled that the ECB was likely to announce sovereign bond purchases on 22 January. “It is not about the actual size of the bond purchases; the key is whether they send a strong and credible signal to investors.” But he also challenged the view of some economists that lower prices were bad for the eurozone. “Deflation is not much of a problem. We are grateful that oil prices are lower and that is a good thing for the real economy. The weak state of demand is the problem and the ECB ought do be doing something to stimulate confidence.” Draghi’s remarks came as data showed that Europe’s manufacturing output was stagnant at the end of 2014. Eurozone factory output was on course for its worst performance since the recovery began in autumn 2013, according to the Markit survey of purchasing managers. The headline index rose to 50.6 in December, slightly up from November’s low of 50.1, but still a lacklustre performance on an index where anything over 50 counts as expansion. Ireland, Spain and the Netherlands performed better than average, but factory output in France, Italy, Greece and Austria fell as orders continued to decline. Germany saw a modest growth in factory output, but some economists remain worried about subdued growth in the eurozone’s largest economy. “The ongoing weakness of German manufacturing also remains a major source of concern, but there are signs that order-book growth could be turning around, with inflows of new work edging higher for the first time in four months,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at the survey compiler Markit. In the Handelsblatt interview, Draghi insisted there was no question of weaker countries being forced out of the eurozone. “A breakup of the eurozone? That will not happen. That’s why there is no plan B,” he said. He also called on states to step up reform plans, by reducing tax and red tape. But a senior ally of Angela Merkel warned the ECB against embarking on financial stimulus without economic reforms from the weaker countries of the eurozone. Michael Fuchs, deputy parliamentary floor leader of the German chancellor’s Christian Democrats, said: “We shouldn’t pump extra money into these states, but rather make sure they continue along the reform path.” In remarks reported by Reuters, he said there would be “fierce discussion” about the ECB’s bond-buying plan at its next policy meeting, referring to well-known opposition to quantitative easing from the head of the Bundesbank, Jens Weidmann.",profile/jennifer-rankin,Jennifer,Rankin

Spokeswoman Kristen Orthman said the senator was “ready to get back to work” and had gone home to Henderson, prior to returning to Washington this weekend ahead of the Senate reconvening on Tuesday.  White House spokesman Eric Schultz said President Barack Obama had called Reid “to wish him a full and speedy recovery” and was glad to hear the senator was doing well.  Reid was exercising at his home in Henderson, Nevada, south-east of Las Vegas, when he had the accident. “A piece of equipment Senator Reid was using to exercise broke, causing him to fall and break a number of ribs and bones in his face,” his office said in a press release. “Senator Reid will return to Washington this weekend and be in the office Tuesday as the Senate prepares to reconvene. His doctors expect a full recovery. “Senator Reid was first brought to St Rose Dominican Hospital in Henderson by his security detail. He was then transferred to UMC for further testing, where he was admitted overnight as a precaution.” One colleague, Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, tweeted: “Now there’s a man serious about new year’s resolutions! Get well soon, @SenatorReid. See you back in DC.” In October 2012, Reid suffered rib and hip injuries in a car crash. In 2011, a fall resulted in a dislocated shoulder and a bump to the head. In the November midterm elections, Democrats ceded control of the Senate to Republicans, ending Reid’s tenure as majority leader, which began in 2007.

Katie Amos and Lee Johnston’s baby, Dax, reportedly born weighing 3lbs, is in the neonatal intensive care unit at Lenox Hill hospital in Manhattan.  On Friday, a hospital statement said: “Lenox Hill Hospital continues to work with the insurance carrier regarding payment approvals for all services rendered by the hospital, anesthesia and physician services from their insurance carrier. We will ensure that there will be no financial impact to the family. “In addition, our staff has been going above and beyond to ease the overall experience for the family, from arranging a place to live for the duration of their stay to helping them communicate with their family in the UK.” By Friday afternoon a fundraising page – started in an effort to help Amos and Johnston – entitled “Dax’s Tale of New York” had raised $9,577.68 (£6,248).  Earlier, the couple’s friend Richard Crow wrote on a Facebook page of the same name: “Great news! I believe I can confirm that all medical bills will be covered! It’s been a long wait but well worth it! Due to the publicity that has gone on around the whole story, it has forced them to pay!” The Facebook page had garnered more than 13,600 likes. Amos and Johnston, from Lincolnshire, said they were told by doctors their bill could reach $200,000, as they would have to stay in hospital until 10 March, when Dax would be cleared to travel to the UK. The baby was reportedly born 28 December. Crow said he started the fundraising page because people wanted a way to help the young couple out. He said Johnston and Amos had not asked him to do so.  “I am running it. Neither Lee [nor] Katie have asked for any money”, he wrote. “Myself and a few good friends got together to see what we could do to help them. It was only really to be a local thing. It was decided we would start a FB page and I said I would run it. It was also my decision to do the page as baby Dax.” Crow’s efforts attracted significant publicity, including support from the British model Katie Price.  Crow said the money raised would be used to support the couple during their extended stay in New York, as Johnston is self-employed and Amos receives only basic maternity pay. He said an airline had agreed to honor the couple’s return flight to the UK when they were ready to leave New York. Crow said the new parents would donate any remaining money to the Ronald McDonald Fund, which has provided temporary housing while Dax is in hospital. He also offered donors the chance to ask for their money back if they felt “cheated” or if they had misunderstood the situation – he said the fundraising effort had not been intended to reach the $200,000 figure quoted for the couple’s medical bills.  The couple did not have travel insurance, but had received clearance from their doctor to fly, Crow said, before they undertook their five-day trip to New York. Dax was born after Amos went into labour during a movie tour of Central Park. Crow said both parents and Dax were well and immensely grateful for the support. “Dax is doing fine,” Crow wrote on Facebook. “Lee got to feed him yesterday for the first time, though I understand it is an [unconventional] task!!! They seem in better spirits now due to … the support back here.”",profile/lauren-gambino,Lauren,Gambino

The centre-half, who has started 26 of the club’s 29 matches this season after a World Cup-winning summer with Germany, offered an insight into what a slog it has been, particularly for the defenders. He noted how the squad’s resources have been stretched so tightly at the back that Laurent Koscielny had to play twice in five days at West Ham United and Southampton despite having not trained fully, as the club manage the ongoing issues with tendinitis in his achilles. Koscielny, who had previously played only twice in three months, was badly off-colour in the 2-0 loss at Southampton on New Year’s Day. “It’s not that easy,” Mertesacker said. “One [player] came back from a long-term injury and then he is just fit for two or three days, and then he has to play. For example Laurent, he has to play. He cannot train for two or three weeks because we have no players left. It’s always tough at the moment. Players come back but they have to play immediately. There is no time or room for building automatic understanding or the kind of things you need to prepare for.” Arsène Wenger has been pilloried for exiting the summer transfer window with only five senior defenders in his squad, a decision that has been exposed as folly by the inevitable injuries and has led to the lack of a settled back-line. Mertesacker was asked whether he felt that the club should sign defensive cover this month. “I’ve no idea,” he said. “We have suffered a lot of injuries. We have to deliver results. We have a big squad but obviously we need fit players. We could do with a small break but we haven’t got a small break, so we need to prepare ourselves again for Sunday. “We have suffered [from the chopping and changing in defence]. We have been through that all season. At one point, you want to be consistent in your lineup, especially the back four. We have to find that. It’s difficult for us at the moment but what keeps us going is our spirit.” Wenger will make changes for Hull, which is a rematch of last season’s FA Cup final which Arsenal won 3-2, and Koscielny seems certain to be rested. David Ospina will start in place of the goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny – a decision that was taken before the Southampton defeat, in which Szczesny was at fault for both goals. Mesut Özil, meanwhile, returned to full training on Friday after his long-term knee ligament lay-off but he will need time to recover match fitness. The selection represents a delicate balancing act for Wenger, given the importance not only of bouncing back from Southampton but of another good cup run. With Arsenal not fancied to win the Premier League or Champions League, Wenger could find that the FA Cup offers the kind of salvation that it brought last season.",profile/davidhytner,David,Hytner

Pardew was never truly accepted by the Newcastle fans during his four years in managerial charge, which ended last weekend when he resigned in order to succeed Neil Warnock at Palace, but that will not be the case at Selhurst Park, where he became a cult figure during his playing days. Millen also said Pardew’s good relationship with the Palace chairman, Steve Parish, would be a positive. Pardew clashed with the Newcastle owner, Mike Ashley, principally over transfer matters. Parish has no plans to sell any of Palace’s better players during the January transfer window. Pardew spent Friday getting his teeth into his new job, as lawyers finalised the small print on his contract at Palace. It is understood that a compensation fee of around £3.5m has now been agreed with Newcastle. Pardew arrived at the club’s training ground in Beckenham at 8.30am and had meetings with the players and backroom staff. He discussed transfer targets for January and Sunday’s FA Cup third-round tie at non-league Dover. He left the training session to Millen and the coach, Ben Garner. “The board and chairman have never stopped a manager bringing in a player,” Millen said. “They’ll have their opinions and financially it’s got to be right for the club but it will be Alan’s decision on who he brings in. I don’t think that’s the reason he left [Newcastle] or the sole reason he’s come to Palace but I know at this club, he’ll have a big say on the players he wants. “Newcastle is a fantastic club with a great stadium and training ground. The supporters are very passionate there but they are here as well. There’s a definite pull for Alan of this being his home-town team. He’s played here and it’s where he comes from. He knows the chairman as well and there’s a good relationship already. “Whether the fans all accepted him when he went into Newcastle, I’m not sure. It didn’t look like it from the outside. For the job he’s done there, you’d expect him not to get so much criticism. I don’t know the reasons why the fans maybe didn’t quite all take to him. Maybe it was the Cockney mafia thing. He certainly hasn’t got that problem down here.” Millen, who has been in caretaker charge since Warnock’s dismissal, confirmed he would stay on at the club in a backroom role but said he did not know whether Pardew would bring in any new members of staff. Millen also talked about Pardew’s intention to add to the squad in January, and the emphasis will be on swift business. “The quicker they come in, the better,” Millen said. “We don’t want to leave it until the end of the month.” Palace want to bring in two or three new faces, ideally a defender and at least one attacking player, who could offer a different option. Millen said the club’s forwards were all quite similar. Yaya Sanogo, the Arsenal striker, has been discussed – Arsène Wenger is ready to loan him out in the Premier League. Palace have lost Mile Jedinak (Australia) to the Asian Cup and Yannick Bolasie (DR Congo) to the Africa Cup of Nations but Millen said several loan players had returned, including Glenn Murray, Jack Hunt and Adlène Guedioura from Reading, Nottingham Forest and Watford respectively. Palace changed their manager last season, with Ian Holloway departing in late October and, after a caretaker stint from Millen, they replaced him with Tony Pulis, who kept the club up. Pardew must do the same. “Alan’s experience is the most vital thing for me,” Millen said. “It was a real help when Tony came in last season – his knowledge of what wins matches at this level. Alan has a great record and he has worked at this level for a long time.”",profile/davidhytner,David,Hytner

United are third in the Premier League, nine points behind Chelsea and Manchester City, so have an outside chance of challenging for the title, but Van Gaal recognises claiming the Cup for a first time since 2004 is more realistic. “Yes, I think so,” said the Dutchman. “It’s the shortest way to success. You are right – we are very interested. And I think my players [are] also. In the Netherlands we have known for many years that the FA Cup is one of the most important competitions in football. The FA Cup was shown on the television over there at a time when it was not common to show matches from other countries. We know from our early exit in the Capital One Cup that league places mean nothing in the cups. In the Netherlands we have a saying: ‘death or the gladioli’, which means all or nothing and we will go into that match fully prepared.” Gary Johnson’s Yeovil are bottom of League One, the same division as the MK Dons side that knocked United out of the Capital One Cup. Van Gaal denied this was a lesson in the mentality of lesser sides. “I know that also [from managing] Ajax and Barcelona. It’s always a shock when you play against a lower team because you assume that you have to win but it’s not like that in football so I have lost with Ajax against a lower team and I have lost with Barcelona against a third-division team. “It’s a gladioli game,” he said. “You are dead or you receive the gladiolus flower and in cup matches it’s always like that. You can win and you can lose and of course we have to win against Milton Keynes but we have lost so what we have learned from that game is what we always learn from games that we lose, what we have not done the right way. United drew 1-1 at Stoke City on New Year’s Day, a third draw in four outings over the festive period and Van Gaal cited the physical demands when considering who might play at Huish Park. “I have to look to the fitness of my players,” he said. “We have played three games in seven days. But the game against Tottenham [0-0] was within 48 hours [of Boxing Day] so the cumulative lactic acid is bigger than ever. “Everything about playing a lower league team will be different – the pitch, the stadium. For the players, it’s more difficult to prepare for a match like this, especially after playing so much over Christmas.”",profile/jamiejackson,jackson,jamie
351,2015-01-02T22:30:01Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/02/micky-adams-tranmere-swansea-fa-cup,Micky Adams restores hope at Tranmere and seeks Swansea FA Cup scalp,football,Football,The Guardian,"Micky Adams is reserving judgment until the end of the season on whether stability has returned to Tranmere Rovers. Even his attempt at an optimistic prediction is handled with utmost care. “At this moment in time it looks as though we are not on the crest of a slump anymore, we are moving up the table, but we can’t take that for granted,” is as far as he’ll venture. It is still a significant step forward given the turbulence that 2014 brought to Prenton Park. Caution is understandable from Adams. He is Tranmere’s fourth manager since February and change in the dug-out was replicated in the boardroom in August when the former FA chief executive Mark Palios and wife Nicola bought a controlling stake from the long-time owner Peter Johnson. They took over a club that had suspended the manager, Ronnie Moore, for allegedly breaching FA betting regulations in February, sacked him after the charge was admitted in April and suffered relegationto the fourth tier of English football for the first time in 25 years a month later as Moore’s assistant, John McMahon, battled against the turmoil. Rob Edwards’s appointment as a first-time manager lasted 12 league games until he was dismissed with Rovers propping up the Football League for the first time in 32 years. The chief executive, Jeremy Butler, has also exited and the experienced hand of Adams was hired in October. Relegation from the Football League is not a risk the Palioses can afford as they look to implement several long-term plans at the club Mark represented 280 times during the 1970s and 80s. Having won two, drawn four and lost nine of the first 15 matches in all competitions this season, Tranmere’s record under Adams reads won six, drawn six and lost three. A reward, or respite, arrives in the form of a visit from Premier League Swansea City in the FA Cup third round on Saturday. “It is a good time to showcase this football club,” says Adams, a man with 18 years’ managerial experience. “I’ve only been at the club ten or eleven weeks but I’m really impressed by it. I’m really impressed by the owners and their ambition. We are trying to pull ourselves away from the bottom of the league, which we have done, and I think it’s a real bonus to be out of the bottom two coming into the Swansea game, but there is still a long, long way to go. We have sucked a lot of teams in with us and we look as though we are going one way and they’re going the other. “What I don’t want us to do is get over-excited about playing Swansea. While it is nice and we can forget about the league for one weekend, there is a real danger for clubs at the lower end getting really excited for an FA Cup tie against the top boys and then being on a big downer the week after. The lads need to be up for Morecambe as well next week.” Plenty is going on behind the scenes at Tranmere where the Palioses are overseeing the sale of the club’s training ground and move to a new facility, upgrading facilities at the stadium and introducing a range of extra community initiatives. The arrival of Swansea, however, is also a reminder of how Tranmere have fallen since Johnny King, whose impressive stature now resides outside Prenton Park, and then John Aldridge led challenges for promotion to the top flight and, in the case of Aldridge, to the 2000 League Cup final. Eleven years ago Rovers beat a Swansea side containing Roberto Martínez and Leon Britton 2-1 to reach the quarter-finals of the FA Cup, with the Welsh club then in the fourth tier and Tranmere a division higher. The goalkeeper Owain Fon Williams admits: “As a Welshman I’ve kept a close eye on Swansea since they were promoted to the Premier League. It is only a few years back they were in the same league as us but they’ve had a structure and maintained that all the way through to the Premier League. We could all look at what Swansea have done, it’s amazing.” Williams adds: “Things are definitely looking up here now. I think it’s looking positive for Tranmere. We are getting stronger each week and we are growing in confidence and that is key in football.”",profile/andyhunter,Andy,Hunter
352,2015-01-02T22:31:57Z,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/02/lydia-mordkovitch,Lydia Mordkovitch obituary,music,Music,The Guardian,"The violinist Lydia Mordkovitch, who has died aged 70 of cancer, took a wealth of musical experience from the former Soviet Union via Israel to Britain, her home for the second half of her life. A strong, charismatic performer and a faithful interpreter of a composer’s wishes, she made more than 60 recordings for the Chandos label, and her native and adopted countries are strongly represented in a wide repertoire that included concertos by Britten, Arthur Bliss, EJ Moeran and Karel Szymanowski, sonatas by Bach, Brahms and Nikolai Medtner, and the Prokofiev concertos and sonatas. Her recording of the two concertos by Shostakovich won a Gramophone award in 1990; their first interpreter had been David Oistrakh, and she was present when he gave the first performance of Shostakovich’s Violin Sonata, another work that she went on to record. Thus she represented one of the last direct links to Oistrakh, with whom she studied in Moscow. He always berated her for not turning up sooner, as the majority of her study had taken place at the Stoliarsky School in Odessa, on Ukraine’s Black Sea coast, where she learned with Veniamin Mordkovitch, later her father-in-law, and a friend of Oistrakh’s from their own student days in Odessa. But although she had received various invitations to study in the Soviet capital, there was insufficient support from her family and teacher to make the move. It was only as a postgraduate that she went to Oistrakh, who prepared her for the audition for the Tchaikovsky Conservatory in Moscow, giving her seven lessons in 10 days, as she recalled in a 1987 interview with the Strad magazine. She drank in the musical atmosphere in Moscow, “an awesome, holy place for music”. Her rather enclosed musical upbringing gave her a phenomenal technique, but left her keen to absorb as much as she could from the open classes given by great teachers in Moscow in addition to Oistrakh – the violinist Leonid Kogan, the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich and the pianists Bella Davidovich and Heinrich Neuhaus. With players such as Stoika Milanova and Gidon Kremer, also pupils of Oistrakh, she was one of the declining number of representatives of a tradition of individual violin playing in which performances and recordings were readily identifiable and full of character. Lydia Shtimerman was born in Saratov, on the river Volga, near Russia’s border with Kazakhstan. The story goes that the actual location was the city’s railway station, while her mother was waiting for relatives subsequently found to have been killed under the Nazis. She started the violin at the age of seven; she wanted to learn the piano, but they could not afford an instrument, so her mother bought her a small violin instead. Later she studied the piano to an equal standard, but at 15 chose to concentrate on the violin. Her early life was shared between Kishinev (now Chisinau) in Moldova and Odessa, before she moved to Moscow to study with Oistrakh; already married, she had to leave her four-year-old daughter, Elena, behind to be looked after by her mother. She remembered the great inspiration of Oistrakh: “Everything he did was balanced, in the right proportion. He never exaggerated, and he was so sincere … He worked mainly on interpretation, on repertoire. “He would spend two to four lessons on one piece, and this was enough as he gave everything in that time. It was then ready to perform on stage.” She recalled how he adapted his teaching to the individual, so one piece of music would sound different in different hands – not always the case. Under Oistrakh’s tutelage she also entered the Marguerite Long-Jacques Thibaud competition in Paris in 1969, and was, to his bafflement, placed 5th (no first prize was awarded that year, with Silvia Marcovici gaining second; it was a controversial decision). After two years in Moscow, her father became ill, and in 1970 she returned home to Kishinev, unable to take up the various performance opportunities she was beginning to be offered. Her father died a year later, and when in 1973 her family applied to emigrate to Israel, Mordkovitch went with them. During the period needed to obtain a visa she was not allowed to teach or perform. During her six years in Jerusalem, she taught at the Rubin Academy and embarked on establishing a new playing life. The founder of Chandos Records, Brian Couzens, persuaded her to record the Brahms Concerto for RCA with the Philharmonia Orchestra under Kurt Sanderling. Her subsequent recordings for Chandos included Brahms’s other concerto with a violin, the Double Concerto, coupled with the Bruch First Concerto, and she went on to record Bruch’s less often heard Second and Third Concertos. In 1979 Mordkovitch made her British debut with the Hallé, playing the Tchaikovsky Concerto under Walter Susskind, and the following year she moved to the UK permanently. Her marriage had come to an end, and she brought with her Elena, later to be heard as pianist in their recording of the Grieg sonatas (1993). Her US debut came with the Chicago Symphony under Georg Solti (1982), and went on to appear with the conductors Riccardo Muti, Vassily Sinaisky, Neeme Järvi, Richard Hickox and Vernon Handley. In 1985 she took part in a performance of Beethoven’s Triple Concerto at the BBC Proms, and in the 1988 season gave Szymanowski’s Second Violin Concerto with the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Marek Janowski. She also taught, first at the Royal Northern College of Music, Manchester, and then from 1995 at the Royal Academy of Music, London. Her exploration of less well-known works continued in later recordings: sonatas by the Polish composer Grażyna Bacewicz and the Romanian George Enescu (2008) were followed by Russian works for violin and viola (2009). She is survived by Elena and her granddaughter, Juliette, also a violinist. • Lydia Mordkovitch, violinist, born 30 April 1944; died 9 December 2014",profile/anne-inglis,inglis,anne

In a terse statement, the fast food company said “payment industry contacts”, likely meaning credit card companies and banks, had reported suspicious activity on 19 December. After those initial reports, Chick-fil-A contacted authorities and cybersecurity companies to help investigate the activity, which it described only as “involving payment cards at a few restaurants”. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment; the company’s statement declares it “premature for us to comment further given the pending investigation”. Cybersecurity journalist and expert Brian Krebs first reported a possible breach in mid-December, saying that several financial institutions had traced the common point-of-purchase on cards with suspicious activity to Chick-fil-A locations. An anonymous source told Krebs that most of the restaurant locations affected were in a handful of states, including Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Georgia and Texas. Krebs believes a breach of Chick-fil-A’s locations would likely have affected only a fraction of the company’s nearly 2,000 restaurants. He compared the breach to those of other medium-sized chains, such as Dairy Queen, that use third-party companies to manage their purchase systems. In those cases, hackers installed malware in the third party’s point-of-sale (POS) software — the technology in a credit card terminal — allowing the thieves to steal data encoded on the back of cards.  If confirmed, the December breach would add to a year of similar attacks on major US corporations. In November, hackers installed malware on Home Depot’s self-checkout systems, netting them 53m emails and compromising 56m credit and debit card numbers. In December 2013, Krebs revealed a data breach of Target’s system; the company discovered that criminals had compromised personal information of about 110 million customers, and also likely used POS infiltration.  In the digital arms race between authorities and hackers, corporations and security firms are struggling to keep pace. In September, the Ponemon Institute, a data protection research group, found that 43% of US firms had experienced a data breach in the past year. In October, a majority of experts told Pew Research they expected major cyber attacks to cause widespread harm in the next 10 years. And nearly two years ago, Symantec, the world’s largest antivirus software company, admitted that its technology could no longer defend against the most sophisticated cyber attacks. With a wealth of credit card data and personal information, hackers can either create counterfeit cards or sell the information to others. Chick-fil-A said that if investigation confirms a data breach, customers will not be held liable for relevant charges, adding that it would arrange identity protection services for affected customers.  Krebs knocked down that offer “as a means of placating nervous customers”, and both he and Chick-fil-A encouraged customers keep a close eye on bank and card statements to look out for suspicious activity and possible identity theft.",profile/alan-yuhas,yuhas,alan
354,2015-01-02T23:01:00Z,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/02/streaming-music-industry-apple-google,"Streaming: the future of the music industry, or its nightmare?",technology,Technology,The Guardian,"  If you wonder what the person next to you on the bus or train wearing headphones and looking at their mobile screen is listening to, it is probably the new radio – a streaming service. According to the music business body the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), Britons streamed 14.8bn tracks last year, almost double the 7.5bn of 2013, as internet connectivity improves and becomes pervasive. Compared to buying music downloads, streaming services have a number of advantages. Listeners can range over millions of tracks – the “universal jukebox”, create and share playlists socially, discover new artists effortlessly through “artist radio”, and listen anywhere (even downloading temporarily for times when their smartphone gets no signal). This year Apple is expected to muscle in on the scene using the Beats brand it bought for $3bn (£2bn) in May 2014, as is Google’s YouTube, which last November launched a paid-for, ad-free music and video streaming service, YouTube Music Key. Snapchat, best known for its self-destructing photos and videos that are a hit with teenagers, is also planning a music feature, according to emails leaked as part of the hack of Sony Pictures. A partnership with the music video service Vevo could be incorporated into future versions – which surely helped the Silicon Valley darling raise another $485m, valuing it at more than $10bn, in the past few weeks. Sometimes it seems as if everyone is planning a music streaming service, just as a decade ago everyone down to HMV and Walmart offered music downloads. But unlike downloads, musicians do not universally love streaming. At the start of November, Taylor Swift removed her new album and back catalogue from Spotify and the other streaming services, having complained in a Wall Street Journal column in July: “Valuable things should be paid for. It’s my opinion that music should not be free.” Ed Sheeran, Beyoncé and Coldplay have used similar tactics, offering CDs and digital downloads for sale before putting them on streaming services – the opposite of the way radio has been used for promotion for decades. Yet streaming revenues are rising fast, according to the BPI’s figures: they have zoomed from zero in 2007 to £76.7m in 2013. Data released by the Entertainment Retailers Association and BPI this week suggested wholesale streaming revenues were £125m for 2014. (The ERA reported streaming revenues of £175m, but typically its values show a 40% retail markup over the BPI’s wholesale figures.) The problem with streaming services, though, is that they seem remarkably ineffective at persuading people to hand over their money. If they are the new radio, well, who pays to listen to the radio? And unlike radio, advertising cannot cover the cost of the service. Spotify, for example, is available to nearly 1.1 billion internet users around the world, yet it can claim only 12.5 million paying users and 50m ad-supported accounts. So only 1% of potential subscribers actually pay. Another service, Deezer, claims to be in 182 countries, giving it about as many potential users (and payers) as Spotify; in mid-2013 it reported 16 million monthly active users, and 5 million subscribers. The US-only Pandora claims 250 million users, but only 3.3 million paying its $5 a month subscription. Mark Mulligan of Midia Consulting who has a long track record watching the music business, reckons there are only about 35 million paying subscribers worldwide for all streaming services, out of more than a billion potential users. Mulligan thinks the problem is the price. Even before the digital revolution, the average person spent less than £5 a month on music, with most spending accounted for by a small number of big buyers. Cutting subscription prices would entice many more to pay, he thinks, easily making up for lost revenues. “I’ve been banging the pricing drum for so long the stick has broken,” he said recently. “Unfortunately there was pitifully little progress in 2014, with label fears of cannibalising 9.99” – the price of a standard album, in dollars or euros, on iTunes – “dominating thoughts”. Something needs to change. The figures suggest streaming is eating into digital downloads rather than CD sales: its revenue growth is almost exactly matched by a fall in digital download revenues, now at their lowest level since 2011. In the US, Nielsen SoundScan has confirmed the same pattern</a>, with paid song downloads down 12% in 2014, from 1.26bn to 1.1bn, while song streaming rocketed from 106bn to 164bn. There’s another difficulty: streaming services tend to lose money. Pandora, the market-listed US streaming service, hasn’t made an annual profit since it floated in 2011. Spotify still records losses – even though it is expected to seek a flotation this year. The main problem is that for each song streamed, the service has to pay a set amount to the record labels; the more songs streamed, the greater the payment, creating a cost barrier that never shrinks. Spotify says it pays out 70% of its revenues to artists. That could be about to change with the arrival of Apple. Its acquisition of Dr Dre’s Beats was seen as a defensive move after a dramatic fall in iTunes music downloads and revenues. “Apple had to address streaming,” Syd Schwartz, a former EMI Music executive, told Rolling Stone in May. When Apple introduces Beats Music outside the US, it could galvanise the market. Music industry figures are eager to see what effect it could have because data suggests iPhone owners are typically higher spenders (and so easier to convert to paying subscribers) than the average smartphone buyer. “We’ve reached a very interesting point where there are important changes to come,” a BPI spokesman said. “It seems that we’re moving towards a time of people understanding that streaming is the future.” Apple is understood to be seeking lower per-song payments from the music labels, so it can offer lower subscription rates. Google’s paid-for YouTube Music Key service launched in November with a six-month free trial and a discounted £7.99-a-month cost (down from £9.99). Mulligan expects that discount to continue, and pricing tiers to fall in line. Yet YouTube itself might be a key obstacle to boosting subscriptions, because it is unofficially the world’s largest ad-supported music streaming service. Teenagers use it to find songs and related artists exactly as they do the normal streaming services. (Snapchat’s user demographic is a perfect match for that sort of service – which Vevo may seek to capitalise on.) When Swift removed her content from streaming services, it created a media uproar – but all her songs, including new album 1989, could still be found on YouTube. Mulligan thinks artists and labels will have to swallow their pride and accept the world of change – and lower payments. “The whole ‘changing download dollars into streaming cents’ issue continues to haunt streaming though,” he said. “With streaming services struggling to see a route to operational profitability the perennial issue of sustainability remains a festering wound. The emerging generation of artists such as Avicii and Ed Sheeran who have never known a life of platinum album sales will learn how to prosper in the streaming era. The rest will have to learn to reinvent themselves, fast – really fast.” • This article was amended on Friday 2 January 2015 to correct the numbers of streamed tracks as stated in the second paragraph.",profile/charlesarthur,,Arthur

Already I’ve been lifting prickly leaves to see what they’re hiding. It’s the time for big blousy yellow zucchini flowers which can be picked, stuffed with cheese, dipped in tempura batter and fried. Such a decadent, glorious snack.  Beside the flowers are the zucchinis themselves. Already there’s a selection of sizes, from the sweet finger-sized growing babies to those thick and the length of a forearm, that have been hidden under the leaves and in what seems like no time at all, allowed to get a bit too big, to become marrows.    It’s zucchini season. Photograph: Lauren Bamford/Supplied.   Zucchinis come in many shapes and colours, not just the long, dark green varieties commonly found in the supermarket. They can be round and a pale green, or nearly black or golden. Be careful of overcooking – a zucchini can easily turn to mush. You don’t need to treat them gently, just quickly. Grilling slices over high heat or over a smoky barbecue slathered in olive oil and salt is delicious. This recipe is a great one for those marrows that have been picked when they’re past their most succulent. A zucchini cake is another wonderful way to deal with a marrow. Cooked in much the same way as a carrot cake, and just as delicious, they require cups of grated zucchini.  The fritters are light and fresh-tasting, perfect served hot as a cocktail party snack or at the beginning of a dinner. Crispy on the outside with the salty, creamy bites of feta at their centre. They are a tantalising appetiser. But if you make a little extra, I also like the leftover fritters cold and a little stodgy from the fridge.

356,2015-01-03T00:01:02Z,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jan/03/new-consumer-debt-reaches-7-year-high,New consumer debt reaches seven-year high in UK,money,Money,The Guardian,"  Consumer helplines have sounded a warning after Britons ran up their highest level of new debt in November for nearly seven years, with the month’s borrowing on credit cards, loans and overdrafts hitting more than £1.25bn. National Debtline and StepChange said the figures from the Bank of England showed a worrying rise in consumers’ reliance on credit, and warned they expected a rush of people seeking help when the first credit card bills of the year started to arrive. Banks and credit card companies have been jostling for business with offers to attract new customers: loan rates have plummeted while balance transfer deals on credit cards have become increasingly generous. The £150bn UK credit card industry is to come under investigation this month by the Financial Conduct Authority over accusations of aggressive marketing after the watchdog suggested it had been pushing “payday loans with plastic”.    The £1.25bn net increase in unsecured borrowing during November was the biggest rise since February 2008, when Northern Rock was nationalised as the credit crunch took hold. It was the third month out of five that consumers had taken on more than £1bn of new debt. More than £980m was taken out in loans and overdrafts during the month, sharply up from the monthly average of £728m over the previous six months. Credit card lending fell to £269m, from £399m in October, but remained above the average for the previous six months. The Bank of England said over the course of three months unsecured lending had grown at its most rapid pace since October 2005, and in November was up 6.9% compared with November 2013.    The figures show that at £168bn – more than £5,800 per household – the total outstanding unsecured debt remains some way below the peak reached in September 2008 when UK consumers collectively owed £208bn alongside their mortgages. However, there has been a marked change in behaviour as the economy has recovered: in nearly every month for the four years to September 2012 consumers paid off more than they borrowed, with banks reining in credit limits and restricting loans and overdrafts, but since then the trend has reversed with almost every month seeing increased borrowing. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Economics, said the surge in retail sales around Black Friday was probably linked to the increase in borrowing – retail experts IMRG estimated £810m was spent online during the promotional day – but he added there were also likely to be other factors behind the rise in debt. “Relatively high consumer confidence means people have become more prepared to borrow in recent months,” he said. “It also may well be that a significant amount of people have recently been borrowing more due to the squeeze on their purchasing power coming from extended low earnings growth.” The shadow consumer minister, Stella Creasy, said the UK had a “massive looming personal debt crisis” and many households were being forced to borrow to fund living costs. “They’re not buying big fancy TVs and posh holidays – they are borrowing to cover the gap between what they earn and what they need to pay for each month,” she said. Creasy said there was a “big gaping hole at the heart of our economy” being fuelled by borrowing, and tackling problem personal debt needed to be a political priority. Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, the charity that runs the service, said: “While most people will be able to cope with this extra borrowing, we are concerned that many households will have overstretched – particularly over the Christmas period.” The chief executive of the debt charity StepChange, Mike O’Connor, said the figures “point to a worrying rise in people’s reliance on credit”. He added: “The economy is growing and there is some wage growth but it is very marginal and millions are living on a financial precipice leaving them vulnerable to financial shocks and strains. “The prospects are for more austerity and economic prospects are uncertain. People may turn to credit as the only accessible way to try and plug the gap. If and when we see an interest rate rise, many more people will struggle.” The charity dealt with 50,000 clients in January last year and expects the figure to be higher this year. Before Christmas, research by R3, the trade body for people working in the insolvency sector, found that a quarter of adults were expecting to take on debt to pay for their celebrations, with 50% planning to use an existing credit card, 24% using overdrafts, and 14% saying they would use a store card. Payday loans, new credit cards and loans from family were among other sources of credit people expected to turn to. In the competition for borrowers, banks have focused on balance transfers, with increasingly long interest-free periods offered as an incentive to move debt between lenders. Just before Christmas Barclaycard started offering 35 months at 0%, and and this week Halifax and Lloyds Bank launched 34-month deals – but such deals involve upfront fees of 2.5%-3%. Personal loan rates have also plummeted: two years ago the best-buy £5,000 loan had an interest rate of 7%; now the same amount can be borrowed at 4.9%, meanwhile on a £10,000 loan you can pay just 3.9%, against 5.4% in 2013. Andrew Hagger of financial website Moneycomms said he expected to see a flurry of new offers over the coming weeks. “January and February is always the period of consolidation, with people sitting down and sorting out their finances. I’m sure we will see some more banks cutting loan rates and offering new deals.” While unsecured credit market increased in November, the Bank of England’s figures showed a slowdown in mortgage lending. The number of mortgages approved for house purchases fell to a 17-month low of 59,029, below the average of 63,191 recorded over the previous six months and down by more than 22% on the 76,574 offered in January 2014.",profile/hilaryosborne,Hilary,Osborne

The research into services offered by English councils revealed there are an estimated 220,000 fewer meals on wheels being served to older people than when the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats came to power. That is a drop of 63% compared with 2010, with prices rising over that time by an average of £237 a year for those who receive meals every day. The figures were uncovered through freedom of information requests submitted by Liz Kendall, shadow minister for care and older people. She said the decline in the vital services was cutting off a lifeline for many elderly people and was counterproductive for local councils. “Removing this support isn’t good for them and it’s a false economy too, if their health suffers and they struggle to cope, and they end up having to go into hospital or a care home,” she said. “We must end this false divide between social care services and the NHS because both are essential to keeping elderly people well and living independently in their own homes.” The FOI requests were sent to English councils with responsibility for meals on wheels, asking how many people received meals on wheels in each of the past five years. Kendall obtained responses from 84% of the councils, finding that in those areas the number in receipt of meals fell from 296,000 in 2009-10 to 109,000 in 2014-15. She extrapolated this nationally to estimate that 220,000 fewer people are now receiving meals on wheels. Labour found the biggest fall was in the past year when the number of people receiving meals from local authorities fell by almost half. Of the councils that responded, the number of meals given out fell from 214,306 to 108,856 – or more than 125,000 people on a national basis. The sharp decline in council-supported meals for the elderly comes at a time when local authority budgets are under unprecedented pressure because of sharp cuts to their funding from central government. Research by the National Association of Care Catering found in November that a third of all UK local authorities have abandoned meals on wheels provision altogether, putting people at risk of malnutrition and social isolation. It said a further half of councils predicted other service reductions in the coming months because of the tightening of social care budgets. The Local Government Association said the decline of meals on wheels demonstrated that the current social care system was “not fit for the 21st century”. At the same time, Neel Radia, chair of the National Association of Care Catering, criticised the cuts to community meals services as “incredibly short-sighted” as it cuts a “lifeline for many vulnerable older people who can face social isolation and loneliness”.",profile/rowena-mason,Rowena,Mason

In a new manifesto pledge, the Tories will commit to capping payouts at less than £95,000. The party said it would legislate against big redundancy payments as one of the first acts of a Tory government, as payouts in recent years have included packages worth more than £450,000 in the civil service, £500,000 in the NHS and more than £1m in the BBC. Treasury minister Priti Patel said it was not right that taxpayers on low salaries have to “fund huge payouts when well-paid people get made redundant”. “We’re going to do something that’s long overdue and that will bring some fairness back to the system – we’re going to introduce a new public sector redundancy pay cap,” she said. “This goes to the heart of our long-term economic plan for Britain – it’s about backing hardworking taxpayers and making sure the economy is tilted in their favour. And it’s about saving money so we help bring down our deficit and make our economy more financially secure.” Those earning less than £27,000 will be exempt to protect the very small number of low earning, long-serving public servants who might have been caught by the cap. Labour said the move was too little, too late as many huge payouts to NHS executives have already been made during the government’s reorganisation of the health service. Jamie Reed, the shadow health minister, said: “David Cameron can’t get away from the fact that this horse has already bolted. He wasted £1.6bn on redundancy payouts to NHS managers as part of his reckless reorganisation. “Frontline NHS staff found it galling that 4,000 managers who received payoffs are now back in NHS jobs. “The government wasted billions on its reorganisation while patients are waiting hours on end in A&E and longer for cancer treatment too – proof you can’t trust the Tories with the NHS.”",profile/rowena-mason,Rowena,Mason

A number of the handler’s runners have been improving for a run this campaign and the selection looked in need of the outing when a creditable sixth in the Hennessy Gold Cup last time. The handicapper has dropped Unioniste 3lb in the ratings for that display and that could prove generous in this lesser company for a classy customer who won a Listed event in easy style from the smart Wishfull Thinking last season. Rain is forecast at Sandown and that will bring the selection’s stamina into play but, if it gets very heavy, Relax would be a big danger, especially given that no trainer has a better record with her horses under testing conditions than Venetia Williams. Sandown 1.50 A chance is taken on William’s Wishes, who won this event in 2013 and should now strip fitter following two runs after a long absence. He had plenty in hand two years ago and figures off a mark only 5lb higher in the ratings now. Wincanton 2.05 A number of unknown quantities figure in the line-up here with a couple making their chasing debuts for prominent yards and Viva Steve, who can normally be relied on to give his running, is a tentative suggestion. Sandown 2.25 It is a very poor show that only four, and one of those a complete no-hoper, have shown up for this Grade One event. L’Ami Serge has already proved himself one of the best novice hurdlers around with victories at Newbury and Ascot and is the obvious selection. Wincanton 2.40 A tricky looking affair with a number of unexposed runners set to make their handicap debuts. Nicholls runs the improving Earthmoves but his stable jockey has plumped for Provo and the selection looks on a very fair handicap mark on the evidence of his run here last season when falling two out when in with every chance. Sandown 3.00 In what looks a competitive contest on paper the suggestion is Amore Alato, who hails from the bang in-form Nick Williams stable and was a creditable second to Snake Eyes over this track and trip last month. Wincanton 3.15 Nicholls again looks to hold the key here with a couple of interesting entries in the field, with Black River looking the pick. The gelding, who was sent back over hurdles after a heavy fall on his British chasing debut last season, is quickly making up for lost time this term and may defy a 6lb hike in the weights for his recent Taunton success.

A player who just last season was competently going about his business in the English Premier League marks his starting debut in the A-League by absolutely tearing it to shreds and scoring a hat-trick. Damien Duff has looked good in the opening rounds, but the former West Bromwich Albion and Hull City attacker Robert Koren is the partner he’s been searching for – ie someone who is not Jason Hoffman or David Williams. Sure, beating Newcastle Jets isn’t much to write home about this season, but the manner in which they dismantled Phil Stubbins’s side on Tuesday would have alerted the rest of the competition to their potential. City have steadily found their rhythm after a poor start to the season, and with Aaron Mooy in scintillating form and Josh Kennedy soon to be part of the side, finals football should now be an expectation rather than a distant hope. Unfortunately for coach John van ‘t Schip the Asian Cup break could not have come at a worse time, but with out of form Western Sydney Wanderers and Central Coast Mariners their opponents in the next two rounds, City could rocket up the table in the new year. Just gotta keep Koren in cotton wool. New South Wales: Don’t sweat the tough times The home fans greeted their players with a banner that read “Fight Like Your Fans”, and after 94 minutes of absolutely garbage football, Shannon Cole almost came to blows with one of the members of the Red and Black Bloc. Security stopped what might’ve become another Pratten Park incident (surely the best soccer riot this country has seen – word is Terry Antonis’s dad was one of the Sydney Olympic fans rioting that day in 1985). For the Wanderers, this must be rock bottom. Depressingly, two of their new imports, Seyi Adeleke and Vitor Saba, weren’t even named in the squad, an indication that they might be moved along just months after joining the club. The Wanderers’ opponents, Central Coast Mariners, are also in a world of pain. Both clubs went into the match winless after 11 games, a national league milestone according to FFA statistician Andrew Howe. Newcastle Jets, meanwhile, are also in trouble with persistent reports of squad discontent, a coach that looks out of his depth, an owner fast running out of money, and a hasty mid-season review called after yet another embarrassing performance against Melbourne City. FFA won’t be pleased that three of the bottom four clubs are from the most populous state, but at least it can only get better from here. We hope. Kenny Lowe: Find a new tune At the press conference after Perth Glory’s game against Melbourne City game last week, Perth coach Kenny Lowe was asked whether he was making too much of the “underdog factor.” “I’m just agreeing with you guys”, he responded, referring to the fact that nobody picked Glory to succeed. “I’ve been saying it for months but you didn’t listen, so now I’ve come to your side and you’re not happy.” The week before the response to an inquiry into their salary cap issues was construed as the east coast media having “nothing else to write about”. Under Lowe it’s Perth Glory against the world, an extension of Western Australia’s morbid fascination with being ignored by the rest of the country. The sad part of all this, of course, is that once upon a time Perth Glory would look down on everyone from a great height and sneer. They were the big boys, everybody else wanted to be like them, and they acted with the appropriate chutzpah. Now, they’re constantly whining about not being respected by the people “over east”. Whether by hook or by crook, Perth Glory are top of the table. Time for them to act like it. Australia: Don’t embarrass ourselves at the Asian Cup Tuesday night’s matches at Hunter Stadium in Newcastle and Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane were a worry. Both playing surfaces do not look up to standard, particularly the latter, which is thinning worse than Frans Thijssen’s hairline and riddled with unsightly patches and clumps. Hunter Stadium has been a headache for a while, although the playing surface has been recently upgraded, while Suncorp Stadium needs rapid improvement. The teams are arriving – Iran had to stop in Melbourne in the early hours of Wednesday morning after failing to beat Sydney Airport’s provincial ‘late night curfew’ – and soon the biggest football tournament in Australia’s history will be underway. Japan, for example, are playing in both Newcastle and Brisbane in the group stage, and are accustomed to carpet-like surfaces. You have to wonder what they’ll make of the decaying facilities at Hunter Stadium, or the potato field that is Suncorp Stadium. Hey, at least we’ve got a few new covered benches. That’s a thing. A-League fans: Know when to call it a night Over the past decade, there have been some entertaining matches between Sydney FC and Brisbane Roar. Like that time a couple of seasons back when Besart Berisha scored a late winner for Brisbane, stripped down, and encouraged Pascal Bosschaart to take things outside. The Tuesday night game, however, was not one for the scrapbook. In fact it was one of the worst A-League games in living memory. Perhaps it was the humidity or the horrid state of the pitch, but even that, if we are honest, cannot excuse the mindless thrashing about from both sides. It was almost comical in parts as players repeatedly failed to control the most straightforward of passes, determinedly slogged the ball into the stands and tripped over their own feet. There are occasions when a 0-0 draw can be entertaining. Not this time. But there was to be no mercy. The New Year’s Day fixture between Central Coast Mariners and Western Sydney Wanderers was yet another drip on the collective forehead of fans in the water torture that is the A-League’s 10th season. The first half was boring enough to bring one to mild self harm, and more than a few fans at Parramatta Sadium would’ve been hoping for one of the contestants to choke and die during Primo’s promotional halftime hot dog eating contest, if only to keep them entertained. There’s something about this time of year – what with Christmas family reunions, New Years resolutions and all the rest – that makes you question the state of your soul, the world around you and the meaning of life. Is this particular cut of jeans still appropriate for my age bracket and my expanding waistline? Should I spend less time on the internet? Is now a good time to invest in shares on the stock market? Should I quit my job and help build schools for underprivileged children in Africa? Is there a God, and if so, which one should I submit myself to? And perhaps most importantly for us A-League fans, why have I been wasting my life watching shit football? ",profile/joe-gorman,Joe,Gorman

I took a path descending from the ridgeway towards the river Unk. This insignificant stream concertinas its way down a valley too big for its volume, like a scrawny boy in a fat uncle’s hand-me-downs. Its quiet surrounding landscape is one of robust spurs and rounded hill flanks. On a mist-smudged day of the year’s ending all was still, not a breath of wind to stir the last lemony leaves on field maple, the last umber hangings of scattered sentinel oaks. Something sulphurous caught at my throat as I reached the margin of Nut Wood – a pungent animal scent, neither stoat nor polecat but surely one of that family? In the same instant my ears were assailed by fingernails-on-a-blackboard screechings of an alarmed wren, which whirred to and fro, in and out of the underbrush, minutely and vociferously indignant. Why was it scolding? I stilled myself into the landscape and watched: focusing on the wren’s continuing commotion, absurdly loud for so small a creature; recalling how my grandfather would reward me with a farthing coin bearing Humphrey Paget’s alert, dumpy 1937 design of the bird whenever I spotted one in the hedges of the Manchester park at the bottom of his street. As I remembered this, the wren’s protests reached a crescendo. Bounding out from under gorse bushes came a weasel – a slender, dancing presence in chestnut and white, vibrant, little over a foot long, dark eyes in its arrowhead skull searching for prey. It ignored the wren, scented around, loped over to where a small rabbit crouched immobile under a bank. In a savage flurry of motion it fastened on the back of the rabbit’s neck, and bit hard and deep, then disappeared as swiftly as it had come, leaving the unresistant rabbit paralysed, trembling: a hedgerow brutality, a survival necessity, savage but not tragic, miniaturised, only the wren’s alarm as elegy.

He would perhaps have been a gooseberry in the mutual appreciation society that existed between Arctic Monkeys and Amy Winehouse; still, with his appealingly rough vocals, increasingly tasteful arrangements, and occasionally wry observations, there are suggestions of common ground. That, at any rate, is what was hinted at by his Caustic Love album of last year. All cheeky double-entendres and slick brass arrangements, the album’s occasional raw rock moments called to mind Rod Stewart for some. A reach, perhaps, but it does mark an improvement. His first two albums eased him comfortably into the role of Radio 2 cheesemaster; now it looks as if he might be getting more interesting. The SSE Hydro, Fri, touring to 13 Jan JR Scott Hamilton Quartet London, Folkestone In the late 1970s, when he had just emerged as a young defender of that era’s most unfashionable jazz approach – the pre-bebop, pre-second world war swing style – US saxophonist Scott Hamilton was widely regarded as a talented anachronism. But as awareness grew that jazz’s many facets were all directed towards the same spontaneous music-making, Hamilton’s sheer class and musicality came to be more widely appreciated. Four decades on, Hamilton still hears a good song as an invitation to spin endless fresh melody, and vast experience has given him the ability to convey a lot of musical meaning that he doesn’t need to shout out. His recent album, Dean Street Nights, was made with his sharp-eared London rhythm section, and that mixture of sambas, sparky blues and the occasional diversion into bebop is likely to figure prominently on this visit.

It sounds like a lot of other things, too: Sonic Youth, the Wedding Present, the Popguns. But never mind the originality; feel the passion and the energy. This, the Cardiff five-piece have in spades, and it’s what has been the driving force behind them to date. Very much at the sweeter end of noise, the band are stealthily melodic, with harmony vocals helping Alanna McArdle’s righteous ire slip down, while their DIY punk credentials – booking their own tours and so on – clearly extend to getting an early start on the year.

This more recent disc has an icy cool, metallic edge in its sparse electronics, with shapes cast from a fiery pit of guitar. Collaborators RocketNumberNine, build a great scrapheap of ragged funk rhythms and fuzz-heavy half-riffs, from the top of which Cherry calls out clear and strong with high-wire vocals. These two dates in a great, relatively new venue are a chance to catch the former pop star turned experimental jazz singer playing small shows ahead of a larger tour later in the month. Ramsgate Music Hall, Mon & Tue JLA Darren Hayman & The Long Parliament, London Once the writer of indie rock in extreme close-up, with no emotional stone left unturned, Darren Hayman has now pulled back into more conceptual work. Recent projects have included an album of songs composed on a daily basis at the start of the year (January Songs), and now he’s made new work based on something he found in a Walthamstow museum: a William Morris leaflet called Chants For Socialists. A teenage Billy Bragg fan interested in leftwing musical initiatives such as Red Wedge, the subject matter has proved resonant for Hayman in a time when few political songs are being written. His new album, which sets tunes to the Morris words is not, however, a particularly didactic work or a call-to-arms, more a warm, interesting and engaged piece of folk art, which says a lot about the power of making music together. Aside from this gig, he plays a free show at the Union Chapel, N1, on 24 Jan.

But it, and Dudamel, remain among classical music’s hottest properties. Orchestra and conductor have been together for 15 years now, and while Dudamel’s career has continued to spiral to the stratosphere, the orchestra has matured into one of South America’s leading ensembles. A recent book claiming El Sistema – the Venezuelan music education system that produced the orchestra – is not quite what it claims, hasn’t so far tainted its reputation, though it remains to be seen what impression these programmes of Beethoven, Orbón and Wagner leave behind.

Multi-millionaire and family man Todd would rather his customers were no fatter than a size 6, but then I suspect his retail venture isn’t really that dependent on a viable business plan. Chrisley Knows Best (Wednesday, 10pm, ITVBe) concerns itself with the lives of an affluent, God-fearin’ Georgia family and the buffed, preened dictator at its head. You can’t take your eyes off Todd as he towers over his brood: wife Julie, whose perpendicular blow-dry is so powerful her eyebrows are pulled into its gravitational pull, and children Lindsie, Kyle, Chase, Savannah and Grayson. This may be a little premature, but it’s a contender for the most jaw-droppingly compelling programming of 2015. By now, we all know the deal with this type of reality TV and the dysfunctional rich families at the centre, whether it’s the cute dysfunction of the Osbournes (all fun and games until two Osbourne children ended up in rehab), or the Kardashian brand of sterile dysfunction engineered by sexy woman farmer Kris. Todd’s dysfunction is closely linked to his nouveau riche status. As he takes us through his vast mansion, he’s keen to remind us he hasn’t forgotten his country roots, nor the proper way to raise his children. We then get to watch him remotely monitoring their calls and texts, tracking the cars he buys them, and scrutinising all internet traffic lest his sons look at online pornography (spoiler alert: Chase’s laptop ends up in the bottom of the Chrisley pool). With the show already two seasons deep in America, keen readers of Mail Online will recognise the Chrisleys from stories about their bankruptcy or their now-exiled son Kyle, who has Daily Mail reporters on speed dial for each time his father does something bordering on sociopathic, like kidnap his granddaughter. But as Todd explains: “It’s Todd’s way or the highway, because he who has the gold rules. And I have the gold”. Also having the gold this week is The Super-Rich And Us (Thursday, 9pm, BBC2), a detailed inventory of Everything That’s Wrong With This Country, and the most depressing hour of television you’ll get this side of Mark Wright gurning his way through a pasodoble. In short, it deconstructs the myth of trickle-down economics: the idea that if the rich are extremely rich, any pennies falling out of their diamond-encrusted purses might eventually be picked out of the gutter by the poor. In related matters, it also explains how Britain has become a playground for the rich thanks to our obscene tax loopholes which can be traced, like a trail of bin juice, to Britain’s Empire. I’m using my entire earnest quota for the year here, but it is very important that you watch this programme, even if it might – MIGHT – have you doing that weird cry-laughing most often seen at lights-up at ill-fated house parties. The moments which might occasion such a response include the bit where it’s revealed that the austerity cuts – which total £80bn – are exactly equal to the sum the rich have gained in the same period, almost as if the cash is flowing directly into their pockets while others literally starve to death. Presenter and Guide alumni Jacques Peretti takes to the middle-class streets of Twickenham and finds they’re even struggling there. One woman explains how she’ll cope with no pension: “I’m off to Dignitas!” But euthanising yourself for capitalism isn’t the answer. I’d previously thought eating the rich was, but watching this stream of corpulent free-market merchants clammily lying through their pointed teeth, I’m not sure they look so appetising. I soon realise it’s not reality TV – or failing to live in a mansion containing 30,000 square foot of rococo-style moulded plastic – that make me feel inadequate.

Sage tea with cranberry, apple and cinnamon Coming from a country with long, cold winters led Kurdish people to come up with variety of hot beverages. Herbal tea is one of the most common hot drinks we consume, not only for its flavours, for its health benefits too. This is my take on Kurdish sage tea. It is perfect for cold winter days. The peppery sage cuts through the tangy cranberry and sweet apple and blends so well with warm, spicy cinnamon.Fadime Tiskaya, via GuardianWitness   Fadime’s pic of her refreshing sage tea  Serves 41 red apple, roughly chopped100g cranberries2 cinnamon sticks1 litre boiling water15-20 fresh sage leavesHoney, to serve 1 Wash the apple and cranberries. Put the cranberries in a pan and crush them a little bit with a potato masher or a rolling pin so they can release their juices. Add the apple slices and give them a little crush as well. 2 Put the cinnamon sticks into the pan, pour over the boiled water and on a low heat bring it to the boil. Turn the heat up, let it boil for 10 seconds and turn the heat off. Give it a stir, then after a minute or so stir in the sage leaves. 3 Put the lid on, then let it brew in a warm place for 10 minutes. Strain it into cups and serve as it is, or with honey or sugar. If you want it warmer you can gently reheat it, but make sure you don’t boil it. Crispy sage leaves One of the things I missed most while working on cruise ships was cooking. The food on board was fantastic and varied, but I worked on the admin side of things so was never allowed into the galleys to make my own food. However, my colleagues and I did once get the opportunity to cook when our ship went into dry dock for two weeks. The enterprising ship’s joiner set up a makeshift kitchen in his workshop, and myself and friends of all nationalities cooked to our hearts’ content. We had an enormous provisions store from which to snaffle our ingredients, and for a glorious two weeks we hosted endless dinners for anyone who stumbled upon our “secret galley”. The joiner with the workshop was Italian, and made these sage leaves to nibble on as we cooked each evening. I’ve introduced coarse semolina into the mix to give the leaves extra crunch. It’s important the sage has a strong flavour: you can usually tell this by smell. MizPepperpot, via GuardianWitness   MizPepperpot’s crispy sage leaves.  Serves 4-625–30 large, fresh sage leaves1 egg1 tbsp water2 tbsp cornflour2 tbsp coarse semolinaA good pinch of celery saltBlack pepperVegetable oil, for deep frying 1 Rinse and pat dry the leaves. 2 Beat the egg with the water. Combine the cornflour, semolina, celery salt and pepper in a bowl, then mix well. 3 Fill your pan with oil to a depth of 2cm. Heat the oil to about 190C/375F. You can test if the oil is hot enough by dropping in a small piece of bread: if it sizzles and turns golden and crisp, the temperature is correct. 4 When the oil is hot, dip the leaves into the egg, then into the flour mix, then fry in the oil until crispy and turning golden – about 3 minutes. 5 Serve warm as a nibble, or use to top a salad or garnish a dish. Sage-brined pork chops with sage-cider gravy Pork chop is an inexpensive cut. It can taste dry and tough, but when brined, the meat becomes juicy and tender. Serve with a simple bean dish and a cabbage-fennel slaw (and a glass of cider, of course!).Angela Kim, via GuardianWitness Serves 22 pork chops, bone-in2 tsp vegetable oil  For the brine750ml water3 tbsp sea salt6 peppercorns, lightly crushed8 juniper berries, lightly crushed2 garlic cloves, lightly crushed5 sage leaves, bruised2 tsp fresh rosemary leaves, roughly chopped  For the gravy1 small shallot, finely chopped7-10 sage leaves, sliced finely25g pancetta or bacon cubes½ apple, finely diced1 tsp flour90ml dry cider1 tsp dijon mustardBlack pepper, to taste 1 Bring 250ml water, and the remaining ingredients for the brine, to a boil. Mix in the rest of the water (500ml) and let it come to room temperature. Place the pork chops in a shallow baking dish and pour the brine over. Cover and refrigerate for 4-5 hours. 2 Take the chops out of the fridge 30 minutes before cooking. Remove them from the brine and pat dry. Discard the brine. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. 3 Heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed ovenproof frying pan over a medium heat. Cook the chops on one side for about 4 minutes, until nicely browned. Flip, and place the frying pan in the oven and cook for about 6-8 minutes, depending on the thickness of the chops. The temperature in the thickest part of the chop should read around 65C. Take out of the oven, place the chops on a plate and cover with aluminium foil. Let the meat rest while you make the gravy. 4 To make the gravy, put the frying pan back on the hob over a medium heat. Add the shallot, sage, pancetta and apple. Fry until they start to soften. Sprinkle with the flour and stir once. Add the cider to deglaze. Add the mustard and stir to combine.

When the oil is sizzling, drop 2 tbsp of the batter into the pan, shaping them into neat, even discs. Fry over a moderate heat for about 3 minutes until golden, then carefully turn them over and fry the other sides for about 2 minutes. 4 Drain the fritters on kitchen paper, transfer to a serving platter and keep warm in the oven.

But the seasonal members who come in desperation after an indulgent Christmas make me feel uneasy. As you step on to the scales, I feel more like a priest than a teacher: “Forgive me, father, I have gained two stone.” There is nothing to forgive. I don’t want you to feel guilty for enjoying a cupcake. If you want to lose weight, I can help you sidestep the doughnuts, but I won’t be wagging a finger at you. The whole weigh-in palaver is in itself so demeaning. You are not a child – I trust you to tell me whether you have gained or lost weight – but the elaborate business structure behind me insists that I do, so I do, with as little fuss as possible. My pay is linked to the average weight loss per class, so it’s a necessary evil. The potential for me to be patronising and belittling is huge. I remember one teacher telling me to “rethink my approach to food”. What? Not take a run-up? Because I, too, was once overweight. We’ve all been there, wincing at the double chin in the photos, when all you can remember about the night is having a brilliant time. Putting on weight is ridiculously easy. Everyone knows it, and my new members hope that paying a fiver a week will magically dissolve the extra flab. Luckily, come February, the newbies will have tailed off and it’s just the regulars and me again. I prefer their attitude – weight loss has become secondary to a weekly chat and a cup of tea (no biscuits). • Tell us what you’re really thinking at mind@theguardian.com",,,

Someone should do something about it. The government should move it. The calendar is an idiot. All of those resolutions to be a better, purer person, and those vows to turn down every delicious offer of drink, and this weird pervert thing about trainers and gym memberships – does this really have to happen in a month in which you have to get dressed for work at a time of day so dark that it could quite easily be rebranded as the middle of the sodding night? When sunlight drops in for only an hour or two per day, a lover married to another continent, sneaking in for a couple of hours before going back to his wife? For years after leaving university, I would buy only academic year diaries, as I was convinced that a new year should begin at the end of summer. I still am. Ah, lovely September, with its smell of pencil sharpenings and clean uniforms; its Michaelmas and its harvest festivals – this is when people can embrace the new and make changes. You have some hope of getting them to work then. January, on the other hand, is a time for bedding down and staying with what you know, and if what you know is a mild tendency towards alcoholic beverages and the eating of cake, then so be it. In the time of year known for tax returns and peak divorce rates, you’re going to need a crutch. Yet still there is this strange and misguided belief that it is the month in which the machinery of your life should be given a complete overhaul. When it all starts up again. Perhaps you are reading this on a train, headed to the big city you now call home and where work begins again this week, back from the smaller place where you grew up, and where you have left your family behind. January often begins like this for me, with the trip down the east coast mainline from Yorkshire back to King’s Cross. Accompanied by that giddy feeling in the stomach, as the fields start disappearing outside, and the metropolis emerges bit by bit, like a time-lapse film. Buildings drawing closer together, as if they were safari park animals who had wandered over to your car to get a good look at the newcomers. At first it’s cute, but then you’re surrounded by the city. It’s exciting. It’s terrifying. It’s getting dark. You feel a pang, a judder of homesickness, but you don’t know which way for. You pass a cluster of tower blocks, standing like totem poles on the outskirts of the city, letting you know that you are nearing your people now: the city-dwellers. And then you look at the lights that are on in some of the flats, every lit room a box of possibility, and you feel the buzz of electricity again. Well, entering the city feels the same for me as entering a new year – the two are inextricably connected in my mind. Part of you knows what is coming, because you have been here before, and you have been you before, and nothing changes overnight. But part of you believes that this is new. Perhaps you are gearing yourself up for 2015, where everything is going to be – how can I put this – reasonably like it was last year, actually, unless you have had your head taken off and put back on facing the other way. Don’t get me wrong, I love change. I love new bursts of energy, and lives made up of different acts. I love the self-help books that most of my friends ridicule. I don’t want to be the woman I was at 23. But I’ve never known new year’s resolutions to be the way to change that – particularly as they seem to involve, on the whole, a massive denial of fun. In my experience, life can only get better when you resolve to have as much of that as possible. • Follow Sophie on Twitter",profile/sophieheawood,heawood,

Looking up at the exposed duct work suspended from the ceiling, I recall that this building was once a supermarket, and that when it was, I used to work in it. My wife passes by, and briefly holds a V-neck jumper against my chest. “Eight dollars,” she says, draping it over my shoulder. Back in the car, my wife consults a mental check list: she has more things to buy, including, possibly, another suitcase. We pause at an intersection. “Which way is CVS?” she asks. I look up and down the road in both directions, lost in my own home town. “That sort of depends,” I say, “on what CVS used to be.” Walking down to the beach with my father that afternoon, my eye snags on change. The last big hurricane prompted a lot of people to sell up, and new homeowners have been compelled to raise their foundations in order to qualify for flood insurance. When you revisit the haunts of childhood as an adult, everything is meant to look smaller, but in my old neighbourhood the houses loom, outsized and vertiginous. “I’m supposed to use a cane when I go out,” my dad says. “Are you?” I say. Nobody told me. “I’m fine on this,” he says, indicating the road surface with a sweep of his hands. He does indeed seem fine – especially for 93 – but what do I know? “Everyone I know dies falling down the stairs,” he says. “I’m careful on stairs.” “That’s good,” I say, pointing to a newly risen home on a concrete plinth. “What used to be there?” “They told me not to drive, either,” he says. “But I’m fine in a car.” That evening, sitting around the table with my father, my wife, my children and my three siblings, talk again turns to health. My sister details a number of eye-watering procedures she has recently undergone, and I should apparently undergo, simply because I’m over 50. “People in this country go to the doctor too much,” my wife says. “I haven’t been to a doctor in 10 years,” I say. “Why is that good?” my sister says. The whisky I bought at the airport is being passed round, a little too slowly for my liking. “I’m not sure I’ve ever had chickenpox,” my brother says. “Should I get a shot?” “You don’t want chickenpox now,” my other sister says. “I missed the first talking picture because I had the measles,” my dad says. “You missed The Jazz Singer?” my sister says. “You could probably see it now,” I say. “What is chickenpox when you get it as an adult?” my brother asks. “It wasn’t The Jazz Singer,” my father says. “It was before The Jazz Singer.” “Shingles,” my other sister says. There follows a long discussion about the benefits of free healthcare, while I sit quietly thinking about all the things that could be wrong with me. At some point my father stands up from the table. We look up at him, and he looks at me. “Did you say you never go to the doctor?” he says. It suddenly occurs to me that I’m not feeling so hot. “Yeah,” I say. “I mean, I know it’s not…” “They make me go to the doctor all the time, for my insurance,” he says. “Otherwise I would never go to the goddamn doctor.” With that, he turns and walks to the foot of the stairs, puts a cautious toe on the first tread, and goes up to bed. • Follow Tim on Twitter",profile/timdowling,Tim,Dowling

She is currently playing Joan Watson, a (long overdue) female incarnation of super-detective Sherlock Holmes’s sidekick in Elementary. She is wonderful: smart and quick, an asset and a challenge to Jonny Lee Miller’s Holmes. Liu is more than a match for his quirks; her Watson does not let him get away with his more objectionable behaviour. Conan Doyle purists have made their objections known, of course, but they hadn’t banked on the unflappability of Ms Liu. I first saw her in that era-defining late-90s series Ally McBeal, in which she played attorney Ling Woo. Much has been written about the tenor and tone of the character – whip smart, fierce, rude and a little too reliant on racial stereotype – but it was the one that pushed her into the mainstream. One Charlie’s Angels franchise, an unforgettable turn as O-ren Ishii in Quentin Tarantino’s Kill Bill movies, and immortality on a Destiny’s Child song later, and here we are. Liu is a New Yorker and this is apparent in her mannerisms. Her hands move a lot and her face has a thoughtful, intelligent quality. She’s been grafting for years, bit parts in TV shows and movies, as well as a career as a painter and visual artist (bet you didn’t know about that). And that’s why Liu is so interesting. She gives you everything you need to know, but not much else – a rare and welcome treat in today’s cultural milieu. She always seems ready. What for? Anything.

The Flemish legend painted warring lions, landscapes and religious scenes, but what made his name a byword for voluptuousness is, of course, his depiction of luxurious female flesh. Striking rather a different note is Goya: The Witches And Old Women Album (Courtauld Gallery, WC2, 26 Feb to 25 May). These nightmarish crones offer a piquant introduction to Goya’s unflinchingly twisted vision in advance of a major show of his portraits later in the year (National Gallery, WC2, 7 Oct to 10 Jan). Summer’s blockbuster run includes Barbara Hepworth’s totemic bronzes, smooth swooshing stone, and woodcarvings punctured by her distinctive holes (Tate Britain, SW1, 24 Jun to 25 Oct). While Hepworth was a linchpin of modernist British sculpture, the self-taught American surrealist Joseph Cornell (Royal Academy, W1, 4 Jul to 27 Sep) went his own way, fashioning his engrossing “shadow boxes” in a New York basement. Filled with treasures from antiquarian bookstores and junk shops, and referencing the stars, birds, literature and more, they laid the ground for assemblage sculpture. Autumn’s chief talking point will surely be the first big British survey for the Chinese superstar artist and activist Ai Weiwei. His never less than spectacular works cut straight to the chase, addressing human rights abuses – including his own – and Chinese history’s contradictions (Royal Academy, W1, 19 Sep to 13 Dec). Meanwhile, the Barbican probes LA-based designers Charles And Ray Eames (EC2, 21 Oct to 14 Feb) and their efforts to rethink the American way of life. Their classic moulded plywood chairs and designs for light-filled geometric homes offset collaborations with diverse 20th-century greats, including film-maker Billy Wilder. Around the same time, the Barbican’s Curve gallery will profile rising British art star Eddie Peake, known for libidinous performances and acid spray-paintings channelling urban club culture and sexuality. An Alexander Calder retrospective (Tate Modern, SE1, 11 Nov to 3 Apr) should to bring the year to an ebullient close.

This outing will be larger, prettier and even more open-ended. The Order: 1886 PS4     A steampunk vision of Victorian London where monsters roam, ready to be hacked to pieces by a shadowy organisation called The Order. It might involve a lot of coal-fired super-technology, but its setting and devotion to storytelling already stand out. Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain Xbox One, Xbox 360, PS3, PS4 & PC     Like last year’s Ground Zeroes, this will put grizzled antihero Snake into an open world, letting you approach objectives however you like. Snake now smokes E-cigarettes and is once again voiced by Kiefer Sutherland to no great effect, but judging by Ground Zeroes, this should be dazzling.  Splatoon Wii U     Nintendo turns its hand to multiplayer shooters with Splatoon, in which you fire volleys of brightly coloured paint at other players and also at the environment, with the team managing to paint-spatter the biggest floor area winning. Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture PS4      Set in pastoral England in the mid-1980s, this is an alternative take on the apocalypse, which for once doesn’t appear to feature either guns or zombies. As you might expect from the makers of Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs and Dear Esther, it looks thought-provoking and eerily atmospheric.  Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End PS4     More deliciously wry story-driven adventures for Nathan Drake, the (naturally) American descendant of Sir Francis. The subtitle’s grim implication that this might be his swansong is about as likely as someone with a money-printing machine deciding to destroy it in a controlled explosion. Inside Xbox One    By the same developer as the exquisite Limbo, Inside looks as though it could be even more spine-chilling and emotionally affecting. Taking place after a cataclysm turns almost everyone into shuffling automaton-like zombies, you have to blend in with the mindless horde as well as avoiding faster-moving beasts.  Mario Maker Wii U     Build your own Mario levels using a tool set that makes good use of the Wii U’s touch screen. Originally intended for use by Nintendo’s level designers, the richness and flexibility of this offering gives you access to enemies, obstacles and level furniture to create your own side-scrolling platform games. Tom Clancy’s The Division Xbox One, PS4 & PC     More end-of-civilisation hijinks, as you team up with other players to patrol a decaying city in search of baddies to end. Ubisoft has had a few hiccups recently, so this will no doubt receive the full benefit of obsessive web forum-based scrutiny. Quantum Break Xbox One     Quantum Break’s tale of a time travel experiment that goes tragically awry is being jointly made as an episodic video game and TV series. The last attempt at this, Defiance, wasn’t a total bust, but wasn’t great; could this one be the breakthrough? ",profile/nickgillett,gillett,

Sex Tape – in which Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel lose control of a sensitive home video thanks to the inadequate privacy settings of an Apple product – hit cinemas three days after a cache of celebrity nude photos was stolen from the iCloud. And then there was Let’s Be Cops. Released shortly after the fatal shooting of teenager Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, the film saw thirtysomething slackers Justin and Ryan impersonate officers of the law in order to pick up chicks, settle petty scores and generally throw their weight around. Needless to say, the film had cultural commentators reaching for their word processors faster than you can say “life imitating art”.    A few moments in Let’s Be Cops seem less plausible in this post-Ferguson world – including a scene in which Justin and Ryan don their ill-gotten uniforms and are instantly treated with admiration by the public at large – but the rest of the film takes on an eerie significance in light of the events of last summer. How could a story in which immature men are entrusted with powers they’re unable to wield responsibly feel like anything other than a work of satire in the current climate? Viewed in this light, the movie paints an excoriating portrait of contemporary US law enforcement. Crucially, Justin and Ryan’s descent into wanton corruption is not depicted as a gradual process; their inaugural act of brutality takes place mere hours after they first don their uniforms. Imagine Frodo after a little too much one-on-one time with the ring, only here his best friend also has a ring and they spend their evenings running around Los Angeles showing them off.

377,2015-01-03T06:00:10Z,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/03/im-a-child-carer,I’m a child carer,lifeandstyle,Life and style,The Guardian,"Lili Kirtin-Grossman has all the traits you might expect in an eight-year-old girl – she’s bubbly, excitable and animated. But this was not what I’d been anticipating. Lili, you see, is a young carer who, for as long as she can remember, has looked after her mother Sarah, 37, who is registered disabled with scoliosis of the spine and bipolar disorder. It also falls upon Lili to help care for her three-year-old brother, Tyler, who is thought to have autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and her sister, Kaya, two. I had even wondered whether the Aquabeads craft box that my own seven-year-old daughter helped me choose as a gift for Lili would seem rather babyish. But she’s clearly thrilled and as soon as we’ve settled in the living room, she wastes no time opening it up and works on it with enviable precision and meticulousness on the floor beside me. Here lies the first clue. After all, this disciplined, orderly nature of approaching things really is the only way to be a young carer. “I have to do a lot to help Mummy,” says Lili, as she nips up to the kitchen area to get some scissors to open some of the bead packets. “In the morning, I’m up around 6.45am. I come downstairs and do the bottles for Tyler and Kaya and make breakfast, with or without Mummy, depending on how well she is. I run a bath for Mummy and help her get dressed, especially with things like zips and shoes, as well as making sure she takes her medicine. Then, when I’ve helped my brother and sister get dressed and I’ve washed up, I go to school.” After school, Lili helps to make dinner and does the washing, vacuuming and cleaning, all the while helping with her brother and sister who, she says “are into everything, and I  mean everything”. At least a couple of times a week, there’s the shopping to do, too. “I really like doing it all, but this is my absolute favourite thing,” she smiles. “Mummy waits outside Sainsbury’s in the car with my brother and sister while I go in to buy the food.” What do the assistants say? I ask. “Sometimes, they look surprised,” she shrugs. “But then again, I use the self-scanner most of the time.” Sarah laughs. “I didn’t even know she knew how to until last week,” she says, impressed. Lili is used to people looking surprised. Most people – even her teachers and friends at school – are amazed when they learn a little about what life is like for her. And this, she says, is why she made the decision to tell a newspaper. Normally, alarm bells would ring for me at the thought of interviewing someone so young, particularly about the most intricate details of her daily life. But Lili was adamant and, significantly, both her mother and Carers Trust, have backed her all the way.    Lili, right, with her mother Sarah, brother Tyler, and sister Kaya. Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian   “We know there are 170,000 young carers in England and Wales – that is, people under the age of 18, who provide unpaid care for a family member or a friend,” says Anna Morris, the charity’s senior policy manager. “But those are only the ones we know about from the census. Research by the BBC in 2010 found the real figure is 700,000. Yet most people have absolutely no idea what these youngsters go through. Lili was really keen to help us raise awareness and having appeared in a short film for us on YouTube to do just that, she decided she wanted to go one step further.” The reasons that children wind up as carers vary. For some, it’s because someone in their life has a physical disability or illness; for others it’s because the person has a mental health condition. For Lili, it’s both. Then there are children who care for people with drug or alcohol issues, or who have someone in their lives in need of short-term care. Usually, there is some help from the likes of social services and health professionals, but it’s often not nearly enough. “The responsibilities of young carers vary considerably,” says Morris. “It can be practical things, such as helping a disabled parent out of bed and bathing them, or cooking for a sibling with Down’s syndrome and walking them to school. Alternatively, it can be a more emotionally supportive role.” Again, for Lili it’s both. “You know when Mum is about to act manic because her body language changes,” says Lili, who has by now made me a cup of tea, suggesting that it might be more sensible to put it on the table than on the floor where I was about to set it down (she’s right, of course). She explains that the changing body language spells danger. “I just try to keep things calm, even if Mum acts hyper,” she says. Not surprisingly, all this has taken a toll on Lili, who suffers from insomnia and anxiety. “She particularly panics if someone other than me picks her up from school,” says Sarah, who has now managed to hobble into her hard-backed hospital chair in front of me. “I’ve had to go into hospital many times without warning and sometimes it’s been very serious. So if I’m not the one in the car waiting for her outside the school gate, she knows that’s most likely what’s happened and she worries I won’t come back.” Lili nods solemnly and turns back to her activity. “She has witnessed some scenes she shouldn’t have done, due to my bipolar,” adds Sarah in a hushed tone. “I’ve had it since I was a teenager. At least I don’t try to, you know, do anything drastic these days. I would never do now that I have children. But I attempted suicide so many times when I was younger that it has ruined my kidneys and that’s another reason I often end up in hospital.”    Sarah’s main concern is the long-term effects of caring for her on Lili. “Obviously, I wish she didn’t have to be my little helper,” she says. “I recently watched someone on a TV programme who grew up caring for a blind mother and she said she looks back and resents her mum and really suffers mentally now. What if Lili winds up like that?” Research suggests the long-term impact of caring as a child can indeed be harsh, with many young carers developing problems such as anxiety, depression, eating disorders and self-harm, many of which can stay with them into their adult lives. One study found that 45% of young adult carers declared they had some kind of mental health problem – twice the national average. “We were surprised it was so high, but when we told young adult carers, they were surprised it was so low,” says Morris. Like most adults in Sarah’s situation, she does everything possible to bring some normality into Lili’s life. “She rarely misses school and she has a friend who comes round from next door, although I do sometimes have to say she can’t come because I need Lili’s help or because I just can’t cope with a fourth child in the house. I feel bad when that happens,” admits Sarah. In addition, Sarah ensures Lili gets her own support – counselling through CAMHS (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service), as well as attending a local club for young carers. “I love the club,” says Lili, excitedly. “We get to do arts and crafts, make cakes, football and gymnastics. The mayor even invited all of us for a special day that he organised. There was an entertainer and we all got an award. It was amazing.” Tellingly, Lili and the other young carers don’t talk about their caring responsibilities at the club. That’s the whole point, says Sarah. “It’s reassuring for these kids to know they’re not the only person in that situation, but ultimately they want to forget about it for a time and just be ordinary children – just as they should be.” Lili also gets a bit of a break every other weekend when the family head off to Sarah’s parents. “It’s a good hour’s drive away, which is hard on me, so we always stay the night,” says Sarah. “Pops is the one who taught me how to use sharp knives and he shows me new things to cook too,” adds Lili, who lights up when talking about these new tasks, although Sarah points out that there are limits. She’s not allowed to use the oven for example. Lili also gets time out to visit her father, to whom she is close. It was while Sarah’s was pregnant with Tyler that the scoliosis began. “At first, doctors thought it was just my pregnancy causing hip pain, particularly as I was born with clicky hips (hip dysplasia). But after he was born, a scan revealed what was really wrong, roughly about the same time I found out I was pregnant again, this time unplanned. It was a really difficult time,” says Sarah. Lili’s school is supportive and indeed very proud of her, says Sarah. “They even held a special assembly about young carers so that both the teachers and pupils get a greater understanding of life for these kids. For a while last year, Lili got extra help at school because she fell behind, but she’s caught up now, which is great. We don’t do play dates, though. I think it’s probably because I don’t get to mingle with the other mums in the playground on account of having to wait outside the gates in the car.” Lili says she has good friendships at school, which is reassuring to hear, particularly in view of a survey by the Carers Trust last year that found more than a quarter of children are bullied specifically because of their caring roles. “We are also aware that some young carers get into trouble at school because their behaviour is misunderstood,” says Morris. “For instance, they may be late or absent because of what is going on at home. They may miss homework or a parent might go into hospital the night before an exam. All this kind of thing has implications for further and higher education too, as well as their chances in the job market. It’s great that Lili’s school is carer aware, but we’d like to see all schools identifying and supporting young carers to do well.” There are times when Lili has had enough. “There are occasions that I ask her to sweep the stairs or clean the bathroom and she has a hissy fit,” says Sarah. “And there are times I shout when I shouldn’t. How many times do I say, ‘Sorry, I didn’t mean it, Lili’?” says Sarah, and Lili smiles. I don’t mean the kind of smile that comes from fear of disagreeing or from apathy. Indeed, despite everything, Lili is clearly cheery – a natural optimist with vibrancy and spark. This is all she knows, after all, and in any case, the atmosphere of the house is a happy one, in spite of everything this family has had to cope with. When it’s time for me to go, I ask Lili, who is now running a bath for her mother, what time she normally gets to bed. “Around 8pm,” she answers. “I’m usually pretty tired by then.” Carers Trust works to improve support, services and recognition for anyone living with the challenges of caring, unpaid, for a family member or friend who is ill, frail, disabled or has mental health or addiction problems. www.youngcarers.net",profile/kate-hilpern,hilpern,kate

(“Honestly love, it’s actually an alliance.”) Anyway, they’ve decided their favourite drink needs a new image. It’s not a surprise really, given that between Stella Artois and Fosters’ advertising campaigns you’d be mistaken for thinking that the only people downing pints in the UK are Aussie lads with a penchant for French Nouvelle Vague directors. There’s the craft beer crew too, of course, but you’d hardly expect the bosses of British Beer Alliance to care too much about what graphic designers drink before they go and see the War On Drugs play live, would you? Instead, they’ve elected to rebrand beer as a lovely nectar suitable for everyone. Director Michael Winterbottom takes time out from shooting Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon blasting Michael Caine impressions at one another to helm the ad, which shows beers of all sizes and strengths being enjoyed by people over Sunday lunch, beach barbecues and even at a Bake Off-style fete. Basically, if the Beer Alliance have their way, every act of ingestion will be accompanied by a pint. “Lunch on your own in the work canteen? There’s a beer for that.” “That cereal bar you had for breakfast? Why not pair it with a pale ale?” “You know what goes well with chewing gum? Beer. Beer does.” They won’t rest until every last birthday party and business meeting is filled entirely with half-cut bods nursing gassy guts and a hangover.

The idea here is that he takes a 50km walking tour of the Large Hadron Collider in order to see it and to work out whether it has anything to teach him. He does the walking above ground, pausing occasionally to descend and have a look at the experiments. He’s got a point when he says that he doesn’t get what physicists are so keen to find out that made them go to the trouble and expense they’ve gone to at Cern. When scientists stop to explain it to him he feels the same as anyone who’s been on the receiving end of a talk about pensions. The first couple of sentences are OK but after that it’s largely, as Alan Partridge would say, “just a noise”. Above ground, in the midst of an Alpine storm, Self apprehends more about the universe than he is ever likely to get from the results of any of the experiments being carried out below. The Greeks, he says, were probably ahead of us and they just used their feet and their minds. Different Every Time (Weekdays, 9.45am, Radio 4) is Julian Rhind-Tutt’s reading of Marcus O’Dair’s biography of one of the great individuals of British unpopular music, Robert Wyatt. One of the first things we learn is that Wyatt was very ill as a child, something he has in common with a remarkable number of singularly driven musicians, such as Joni Mitchell. Another is that when he and the Soft Machine were summoned to America to tour with Jimi Hendrix they landed in Manhattan by helicopter on the top of the Pan Am building, “like a dragonfly on a tomb”, as one of Mitchell’s lyrics characterised it. I particularly liked the image of Wyatt learning by watching the Jimi Hendrix Experience from the wings, noting how the drummer Mitch Mitchell followed the guitarist “like a sidecar”. The term “rocking vicar” resonates because it perfectly describes the need felt by some people in the established church to prove their “product” can match the excitement of skiffle or hula hoops or the internet or whatever the kids of today are into. In the unfortunately titled Hip In A Hijab (Friday, 11am, Radio 4), Shelina Janmohamed does something similar from an Islamic point of view, talking to teenage girls brought up in that faith about how they manage to reconcile it with the teenage need to always be cool. I await the programme that is prepared to explain why all teenagers seem to live under an obligation to act cool, much as earlier generations were obliged to act righteous. In the radio adaptation of his short play Cocktail Sticks (Saturday, 2.30pm, Radio 4) Alan Bennett remembers his parents, “a lovely couple”, who gave him everything but the thing that writers value most: the memory of a difficult childhood. If you were brought up in Yorkshire at any point between the 1930s and the 1970s you have an endless supply of poignant humour at your fingertips. Just take anything your parents used to say and quote it as if it were poetry. It’s done well for Alan Bennett, as this play proves. This script calls for him to say the word “fuck” four times in a couple of sentences. I always understood you needed a senior editor’s sign-off to use the word once. To get permission for four they must have gone right to the top.",profile/davidhepworth,hepworth,david

You know there’s always going to be another chance to be in the present moment, it’s just a question of forward planning. Well, for a start I’m much calmer. And much less judgmental.

What songs can convince the literary, silent types to rethink their folly? Is it really madness to enjoy silence in a book store? Surely madness lies in the antithesis of this, in the trespassing upon our senses of ill-curated storms of sound. Everywhere we go, we are assaulted with a tirade of music, from doctors’ waiting rooms to restaurants to train platforms. Apparently, there is a science behind this: play the music faster and louder, and you’ll sell more – turning us all into unwitting hamsters in a twisted capitalist experiment. This is Orwell’s tele-screen evil eyes reimagined as evil sound systems, over which the staff have no control.    So I’m afraid my remedy is to reprogramme yourself, and enjoy the peace. If you’re worried about going cold turkey, ease yourself into the abyss with Perry Como’s understated Silent Night, and then get closer to the zone with the long, otherworldy chords in John Tavener’s Towards Silence: IV Turiya. Finally, line up John Cage’s 4’33, in which a piano player eases himself into position, hands above the ivories before playing… nothing. Find yourself a perfect oasis of zilch. Still, I get that time can travel slowly at work. If you’re hellbent on persuading your boss to allow music, then propose a playlist inspired by great literature – a talking point that might even help sales. I’d start with the warming layers of Infra by Max Richter, inspired by TS Eliot’s The Waste Land, and a classic – Blur’s Tender, echoing F Scott Fitzgerald’s Tender Is The Night (itself a quotation from Keats’ Ode To A Nightingale).

This year, however, it is laden with masses of huge red apples that are sweet enough to eat. Why has our tree suddenly started producing red, sweet, eating apples, instead of normal Bramleys?Sometimes, Bramley apples can flush orange, with broad, red stripes that make them look very rosy-red, though this usually happens on only one side of the fruit. Perhaps this apparent change is down to the fact that the combination of a heavily fruiting tree and the hot summer has meant the apples have ripened properly for once, and you are now seeing its fruit in their true colours. Bramleys are certainly a lot more flushed when they’ve been allowed to ripen on the tree than you ever find them in the shops. Even so, I wouldn’t call their fruit sweet exactly, although you can sometimes eat Bramleys late, say in spring, and be almost persuaded that they are an eater. Otherwise, the only explanation is that the rootstock has started fruiting. Perhaps the tree is sprouting below the graft union just above soil level, but because it has grown over the years, you haven’t noticed. If the fruits from the rootstock are sweet, I’d take that as a welcome bonus.

I’ve learned to switch to something else every six weeks or so, to lose the buildup, but I always come back for more. My other hero of 2014 is Vichy Aqualia Thermal serum (£16.15), a mid-price treat for any dehydrated skin that instantly imparts moisture and healthy plumpness. I routinely choose it over serums that cost five times as much. Clarins Instant Concealer (£21) blew the competition out of the water last year. It simply covers and brightens under-eye circles better than any other and, millilitre for millilitre (the tube is big, the formula concentrated), costs less than many budget brands. Please, Clarins, make it your new year’s resolution to introduce darker shades, so everyone can feel the love. Glow Maximizer (£28), meanwhile, was Dior’s least showy 2014 launch. It seemed almost unconfidently snuck out, when something this brilliant called for a great deal of showing off. This light-reflecting primer mimics a youthful skin glow to the point where all other light reflectors now seem woefully inadequate.

Where I seek pleasure and excess, “wholesome” promises moderation and salutary benefit. I’m haunted by visions of “healthy” cakes with all the flavour and interest of a piece of cardboard, or loaves as dense as lead weights. And so for a long time I avoided wholesome baking and anything that threatened to come close to it – wholemeal and wholegrain baking were off the cards. But wholemeal flour needn’t mean wholesome virtue: fold it into a cake batter, then cloak with rich cream-cheese icing; marry its nutty depth to soft brown sugar; add to bread for a rounder, subtler taste. Unlike refined white flours, wholemeal contains, as the name suggests, the whole grain – bran, germ and endosperm – leaving wholemeal higher in fibre, vitamins, flavour and complexity than white flour. Where wholemeal flour is called for, it must be used with care: greater flavour comes at the expense of rise; a coarser texture can end up dry and crumbly. But these problems are easily mitigated by adding a little extra liquid (to compensate for wholemeal flour’s greater capacity for absorption) or by combining it with white flour to achieve a balance between taste and texture. In bread doughs, wholemeal will mean you have to knead longer to build up elasticity. Just make sure you buy carefully when choosing wholemeal flour: strong versions are best for bread whereas “plain wholemeal” is a wiser choice for cakes and biscuits. Sweet potato cake with cream-cheese icing I’ve called for sweet potato here because its mild sweetness works well in cakes, but you should feel free to adapt according to what you have sitting around in the vegetable drawer: carrots are the usual choice, but parsnip, potato and butternut squash are worthy substitutions, too.

Stir in the grated sweet potato and the three eggs. 3 In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, spices and salt, then add this to the wet mixture and stir until smooth. Fold in the dried fruit and chopped pecans, then spoon the cake batter into the prepared tin. 4 Bake for 40-45 minutes in the preheated oven, until well-risen and just beginning to shrink away from the sides of the tin. A small knife inserted into the very centre of the cake should emerge clean if the cake’s cooked through. Once cooked, leave to cool in its tin for 10 minutes before unmoulding on to a wire rack and leaving to cool completely. 5 For the icing, beat the butter with the sugar and cinnamon until very soft and smooth. Drain any excess liquid from the cream cheese, then mix it into the butter and sugar a little at a time until you have a smooth, sweet icing. If it’s a little runny, return it to the fridge for a while. 6 Halve the cooled cake horizontally to create two thinner layers, then slather one side of each layer generously with the icing. Stack the two halves so there are two layers of icing. If you have leftover icing, you may be able to ice the sides, too. Dust the top with a little extra cinnamon and maybe some chopped pecan, too.

There’s a general misconception that these chewy tapioca pearls are the bubbles – but they’re not. They’re just the pearls! The bubbles in bubble tea come from the fact that the drink, once prepared, is shaken in a cocktail shaker to produce actual bubbles and make the drink frothy. About 4-5 years ago, bubble tea started making a comeback. During a trip back home to Singapore, I noticed that a new shop that had recently opened was selling two different categories: fresh milk and milk tea. My curiosity was piqued – if the one was made with fresh milk, what was the milk in the other? I was told that milk tea was usually made with powdered milk. Now, this was around the time when there was that big powdered milk scandal in China, so finding out that that’s what I’d been drinking in my bubble tea all these years was a bit of a shock! I felt cheated … On my return to the UK, the trend was picking up – a bunch of new places had opened, but I was disappointed. Everything was so artificial – the flavours, the colours. I decided the food scene in London deserved better than £3.50 for something bad made with powdered milk, so I spent the next year-and-a-half figuring out a plan. I went on a two-month research trip to Taiwan and learned a lot about the bubble tea industry there, and how supplier-driven it was: everything from the ingredients to the recipes came from the suppliers, and they were naturally averse to change. The shops claimed to be tea specialists, but the tea they used was never freshly made. Instead it was made in vast quantities and reheated, either in kettles or with steam wands. Anyone who drinks tea will tell you that is no way to treat it! In Singapore fresh milk isn’t good – it has a vanilla flavour, which I’m fairly certain isn’t produced by the cows themselves. But I love British milk. So I decided I wanted to make bubble tea with fresh, organic milk, freshly made tea and natural flavourings. We wanted to cater to eastern as well as western tastes – which is a slightly tricky balance to strike. Taro milk, for example, or ice honey green tea, are such classic Asian choices, whereas UK customers love ice passion fruit and ice peach tea. We opened on Old Compton St in Soho, London, five months ago. We serve five different categories of drinks: milk (with green or black tea), ice tea (no milk, just fruit flavours), fruity milk (no tea, just milk and fruit flavours), mousse tea (sweet tea with savoury mousse) and – this one’s slightly out of left-field – coconut water. We offer almond and soy milk as well as regular cow’s milk. Our tapioca pearls are baked fresh every two hours, and we prepare our own toppings too – cubes of herbal jelly or egg pudding, balls of popping fruit juice … We really look after our customers and get excellent feedback. It’s such a good feeling to see someone nodding and smiling over an ice peach tea on a hot day. bijububbletea.com",profile/dale-berning-sawa,Dale,Berning Sawa

Surfing under the northern lights? Leaping down an alpine waterfall? Mountain biking through Afghanistan? Most of us know we are never going to come close to actually doing any of these things, but it’s heartening to know someone’s out there doing them – and filming them. The fact that this festival is marking its 10th anniversary this year should be proof enough that the appetite for vicarious adrenaline kicks is alive and well. Eleven danger-freaksome docs are sorted into three programmes, which play in 30 cinemas around the country. The festival begins with a gala screening in London on Thursday, featuring Q&As with some of the reckless stars on screen. Various venues, Thu to 17 Feb London short film festival  More than just another collection of good shorts (not that there’s anything wrong with that), this is a festival with an anarchic, experimental sensibility and no time for social niceties. You can pretty much tell where it’s at by sampling some category titles: Funny Shit, Fucked Up Love, WTF, New Queer Visions, Lo-Budget Mayhem. There’s a particularly good range of programmes for women, including selections on girlhood (and boyhood), motherhood (and fatherhood), “Femmes Fantastiques”, international girl power, women’s erotica and “superficial, homophobic lesbians” (in web comedy The Slope). That’s just the tip of the iceberg. There are music and industry events, and guests including musicologist David Holmes (presenting his debut film and talking to Mark Kermode), a panel of Greek women film-makers, and Andrew Kötting and Iain Sinclair, showing a work in progress. Various venues, Fri to 18 Jan Eric Rohmer, London Rohmer once said he was interested “less with what people do than with what is going on in their minds while they are doing it”. While his Nouvelle Vague colleagues were experimenting with form and structure, Rohmer mined the moral and emotional complexities of situations and characters – a bored single woman (The Green Ray), a Catholic man and a free-thinking divorcee (My Night With Maud), a man tempted into an inappropriate relationship (Claire’s Knee). He’s an acquired taste, but there’s a universal wisdom to Rohmer’s films. As well as a re-release of The Green Ray, this season includes some rarely seen shorts and documentaries. BFI Southbank, SE1, Sat to 27 Jan Conversations About Cinema: Impact Of Conflict, Bristol We might now be in 2015, but the first world war centenary commemoration is far from over, especially with a new adaptation of Testament Of Youth out next week. This new initiative aims to explore the wider repercussions of conflict in the broadest sense, through film and discussion. It starts gently at Bristol’s Watershed cinema, with Rebels In The Rubble – a series of Sunday screenings dealing with the aftermath of the second world war, from Ealing’s light-hearted take Passport To Pimlico to Rossellini’s Rome, Open City, Polish landmark Ashes And Diamonds and The Third Man.

389,2015-01-03T06:00:10Z,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/03/clarence-clarity-i-feel-too-normal,Clarence Clarity: ‘I feel too normal’,music,Music,The Guardian,"Wat Buddhapadipa is the UK’s oldest Buddhist temple. A fantasy of gold lattice and intricate Thai architecture, it appears to have been cut and pasted on to its south-west London site, juxtaposed with the boxy brown suburbs of Wimbledon by some strange, resplendent slip of the cosmos. “I’ve been looking into places that are a bit of a jolt to the system,” Clarence Clarity says, wandering around the temple grounds. “And this here… Well, we’re not in London any more are we?” Even with just a handful of songs to his name, Clarity has been jolting systems with some success of late. Constructed from a reeling sonic palette, like Prince covers sex-yowled over a sputtering dial-up connection, Clarity’s music is a glitching, unsettling combination of sleaze, funk, static and collapse, made all the more intense by the throbbing, eye-ache videos he makes as an accompaniment. Hacking together footage of soft porn, internet memes, chattering dinosaurs and pixelated apocalypse, the Clarity aesthetic – which first emerged on YouTube two years ago – can at times feel like an unfiltered dip into the chaotic flood of online information: stimulating, but also exhausting and bewildering. At the same time it has proved focused and compelling enough to get Clarity a proper record deal, with Bella Union, home to the Fleet Foxes and Flaming Lips. “The videos are supposed to represent that assault of being plugged in to the internet,” he explains, as we walk past a shrine that consists of a tiny golden Buddha sitting next to a jaunty, ceramic Peter Rabbit. “That vivid imagery coming at you, the adverts flashing up, the refreshing of Facebook, and just being overwhelmed by it all. That’s part of what Clarence Clarity is about: me trying to find some focus in the madness. I feel like there’s constant confusion around me, so the aesthetic is deliberately overwhelming, titillating to a point, and there is a part of it that’s deliberately garish and offensive, just for the sake of it. Everything has a slightly seasick feel, pushing and pulling and tripping over itself.”    The music may be challenging but it has also proved intriguing to people won over by Clarity’s sound and aesthetic. They, in turn, have been scrabbling to find out more about an evasive artist who has taken great care to mask his identity. Until now, that is. While Clarence Clarity is still not prepared to tell the world his real name (“You can spend half an hour Googling and find it out if you really want”), he can at least confirm that – as opposed to previous statements – he’s not a Fijian national. Neither is he, as one internet rumour had it, the reclusive north London beatsmith Jai Paul. Instead, he is a man who appears to be in his mid-20s, from the south of England, with a screen-tan pallor, longish guitarist’s fingers and a set of crazy songs. He’s not the world’s greatest interviewee, reluctant to be drawn into making definitive statements and describing himself as “no conversationalist”. He seems keenly aware that any truth about himself is likely to be far more prosaic than any rumour started in the wilds of the web. In fact, he wishes he were weirder. “When I leave the house, I feel too normal,” he says with a sigh. “When I’m doing my music, I’m locked in my own little place and it feels weird and wonderful and totally alien; I go out into the real world and that all falls apart. Clarity is this character I can go into.” Clarity cites Ariel Pink as a big inspiration, and the blurry, stop-start, lo-fi R&B of his forthcoming debut album, No Now, was clearly made under the same self-imposed restrictions as Pink’s hazy tape-hiss pop. Each of the tracks on No Now is sprinkled with seemingly arbitrary shards of audio chaos. “It’s dense and overwhelming,” Clarity agrees, “but it’s consistent as well. It may seem strange over a couple of tracks, but it’ll make a lot more sense over the course of an album.” The anarchy is extended to the track titles – Buck-Toothed Particle Smashers, Porn Mountain – names that suggest the non sequiturs of a random name generator.    As it turns out, the Clarence Clarity moniker itself is a reference. It’s the name given to a well-known internet meme: a photo of a man having a moment of mind-blowing realisation in the middle of a rave. “Sudden Clarity Clarence” is often used to illustrate a Eureka moment (and often ironically, too). Clarence claims the serendipity is entirely coincidental. “I had already chosen the name, then I found that meme. It was perfect, a moment of clarity: Sudden Clarity Clarence looking back at me.” Naturally, there is the suspicion that someone who’s so careful to conceal their identity must have something to hide; and, sure enough, there are abandoned musical projects lurking in Clarence’s not-too-distant past. “Yeah, I’ve got a musical history, and I suppose I don’t want to have to justify why certain things in the past haven’t taken off,” he confirms. “I’ve wiped the slate clean a couple of times. It all feels necessary to have got here.” In an age when public persona is filtered through constantly editable digital profiles, this desire to reset seems less suspicious than a sign of the times. With his meme name, his fondness for Google-sourced imagery and his music built from the distorted scraps of other songs, Clarity is part of a generation of performers who have grown up immersed in their online existence, where information and identity are endlessly sculptable. He even finds it hard to accept that the physical world is anything more than another imitation. “The way I see it,” Clarity concludes, “we’re probably going to converge into ‘the machines’ at some point. Even if we did end up in this universal consciousness in the clouds, we’d probably invent this stupid human condition for the fun of it. Maybe that’s what life is already; it’s more likely this is a computer simulation than anything else.” The Who Am Eye EP is out now on Bella Union; the album No Now is out in March",profile/ian-mcquaid,mcquaid,ian

It’s one that certainly came true for the pub faaaa-mily, as EastEnders topped off a glorious year with a return to the 80s. But enough about Linda Carter’s bejazzled dress. There’s more to this than sequins. Christmas in Walford brought good old-fashioned tragedy. Not since Den and Angie’s eyes met over divorce papers had a Christmas Day harboured so much tension. You could tell it was going to go a bit wrong because all the ingredients of a jolly festive season were there. The most ridiculous of which had to be Jane proposing to Ian like some kind of Lidl Mariah Carey. Nasty Nick Cotton enjoyed a sherry and some parlour games with his old maaah, which pleased Dot no end. Nothing can put her off her beloved boy, not even him and Yvonne popping up from behind the sofa with nothing but his trademark gold chain to cover their modesty. Over at the Beales’ house, Ian was busy crafting swan napkins while forcing the Brannings to dine with him. This was mere distraction. Even as a whacking great piece of evidence lurked under the tree, the events unfolding at the Queen Vic added a “Who cares?” element to the “Who killed Lucy Beale?” question. The Carter festivities started well, with Lady Di sporting a Christmas pudding hat and Linda plastering on her war paint and pulling on that impossibly tight, spangly dress. Even Shirley cracked a smile when she unwrapped the perfect gift: a bottle of vodka strapped up with fags, like a ticking timebomb of pure pleasure. But the most beautiful sight of all was Mick, all twinkly of eye and slappy of bum, dishing out a “You saucy little mare” here and a “Get on that” there, with Danny Dyer-channeling aplomb. But, as Linda climbed those clanging stairs of doom just as Angie had nearly 30 years ago, her fate awaited her at the top. What should have been the most romantic, flamingo-tinted marriage proposal the pub had ever seen ended in tears when she finally told Mick that Dean Wicks had raped her. His reaction was better than anyone could wish for: Mick was a rock. He cried, he squeezed and then, of course, he simmered with fury before beating Dean to a pulp over the dinner table. As the rest of the family squealed and cowered, only one thing could stop Mick in his tracks just as he was about to end Dean. Yes, the most satisfying EastEnders moment of a vintage year came with Shirley shouting: “HE’S YOUR BRUVVA!” The atmosphere over the turkey dinner wasn’t much better in Coronation Street, with the Platt family gearing up for their annual implosion. Gail was already unhappy about her Nick being tempted by Erika, the menopausal minx who thinks nothing of helping herself to a glass of entry level Albariño at the Bistro. “She’s got more front than Brighton,” sighed Liz. “But there’s a very good heart beating beneath that cleavage.” Kindred spirits. It was Kylie who caused the most trouble, as she always does at Christmas, when her not-so-ex Callum started hanging round the salon, all ridiculous good looks and menacing stares. The cheeky beggar even got David to cut his hair, when he didn’t even need a haircut! You don’t have to be Ricardo to see that. “I can’t offer to trim your split ends, but I’ll give you a free wrap,” he smouldered, as Kylie was torn between quaking in her slingbacks and snogging his face off while emptying his pockets of drugs. After all, Callum’s the man who fathered her first-born, feeds her habit and says sexy things like: “You used to be wild. Like an animal. Now you’re chopping carrots.” With impeccable timing, he turned up just as Kylie was playing the devoted wife and preparing to dish up Christmas dinner. By the time Gail popped her head round the door to see how the turkey was looking, Callum and David were locked in festive fisticuffs while Kylie skulked off to pack her sad little suitcase and roll it across the cobbles one last time. Heartbreak hit hard in Emmerdale, where Katie and Andy’s wedding day sent ripples of controversy around the village. Kerry awoke face-down in a kebab as only she can, before retching dangerously close to Katie’s wedding dress. It’s not the worst thing that happened to that dress, though: Bernice poured herself into it, stormed the church and tried to win her man back. There are worse things that could happen to a bride, like discovering your Robert has had “village bike” engraved on your ring. Take heed, Andy. When it all goes wrong, Bernice will be waiting… in your wife’s clothes.",profile/hannah-verdier,verdier,hannah

A range of foods and ingredients free of gluten, wheat or dairy. How much does it cost? Very slightly more than the foods and ingredients that actually come with gluten, wheat or dairy. What does it promise? Once confined to dark corners of funny-smelling healthfood shops, these food ranges allow those with intolerances to eat relatively normally. Increasingly, though, they are also being eaten by people without medical need as an ostensibly healthier choice. What’s it actually like? That depends on what you buy. I went to my local supermarket and filled a basket from the freefrom aisle with hazelnut milk, bakewell tarts made with rice flour and tapioca starch, and gluten-free sausages, all of which managed to taste more or less like the things they were supposed to. But then again, I also bought soya milk, and drinking soya milk is like straining three-week-old yoghurt that’s been kept on a radiator into your mouth through a stranger’s sock. Best and worst bit If you’re coeliac, it must be refreshing finally to have your needs catered for in a largely edible way. However, as someone who can eat gluten and dairy without issue, I was disappointed not to see any benefits. I didn’t lose weight or feel any more energetic, and my skin remained as pallid as ever. All it really did was remind me how much I love bread. Is it worth it? If you need to? Yes. If you want to?

It delights in whipping a bush into a shape, sweeping autumn leaves into corners, toppling those with lofty desires and desiccating the tender. It can be kind, too, bringing soft breezes that cool the sweltering and clear the air. But we notice the wind mostly when it’s furious and fickle: it reduces moisture from both soil and foliage, which can be disastrous when things are just getting going, because it thwarts new growth; it can also damage plants in full growth, where the foliage acts like a sail. Offering shelter from the wind does more than just help out you and your plants: pollinators can’t work well in windy conditions, while wildlife in general prefers to be out of it, too. And the best way to temper the effect of wind is to filter it. The most successful windbreaks – whether hedges, shelterbelts, shrubs or fences – let some wind through. Hedges are great windbreaks, though you may need some form of alternative barrier until they’re established. While not pretty, a commercial windbreak made from thick plastic mesh slows the speed of the wind while allowing plenty of air to circulate, though the windbreak mesh needs to be taut to work, and is best used with straining wires attached to sturdy posts. It’s not cheap, either, though eBay is worth a look. It’s a good solution if you can’t afford the cost of wooden trellis or have a large area to cover. If you don’t have space for a hedge or a screen of trees or shrubs, a wooden fence is the next best option. Go for a slatted structure, hurdles or trellis, rather than solid wood, because the lee side of a solid structure often suffers from turbulence that in extreme cases can knock over plants and cause the whole fence to fall over. Essentially, the wind comes to a halt on the windward side, then does a somersault over the barrier. A slatted fence or porous wall also stops cold air accumulating at the base, which can cause frost pockets that damage plants. Living windbreaks, be they hedges or shelterbelts, are best established between now and early spring (wait for spring to plant evergreens). A hedge made of hazel with a mixture of these edibles would make the most of a small space: elderberry, wild pear, crab apples, Japanese quince (Chaenomeles), fuchsia, cherry plum (Prunus cerasifera), damson (Prunus insititia), hedgerow rose (Rosa rugosa), juneberries (Amelanchier) and autumn olive (Elaeagnus umbellata). If you want something showy for a sunny spot, the pretty daisy bush, Olearia cheesemanii, is salt- and wind-tolerant. In tougher spots, try O. macrodonata ‘Major’, which is quick-growing. If kept clipped rather than left to roam, Escallonia rubra and its hybrids are another flowering choice, particularly in coastal areas; while Hebe parvifolia, H. salicifolia or H. x franciscana ‘Lobelioides’ are worth considering, too. • Follow Alys on Twitter.",profile/alys-fowler,Alys,Fowler
393,2015-01-03T06:00:10Z,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/03/infiniti-q50-sport-automatic-car-review,On the road: Infiniti Q50 2.0T Sport Automatic – car review,technology,Technology,The Guardian,"The Infiniti Q50 looks like a car you’d find in an official motorcade, carrying the second-least important person: heavy but not bullet-proof, elegant but not wallet-busting. It’s a Japanese marque, a couple of decades old but available in Europe only since 2008. It has an isolated feel, as if it were developed away from all the other cars, which can make it seem yesteryear-y. The curvy front and determined heft belong to a pre-agile driving era. Even creating a name by misspelling a perfectly good word seems a 1990s thing to do. And yet sometimes the little idiosyncratic touches play in its favour: everything’s automatic – headlights, wipers, overhead parking camera, the slightly patronising way the seat hums towards and away from the steering wheel, in anticipation of my next move. It got to the point that, when Magic FM came on, I assumed the Q50 knew I was in the mood for Tracy Chapman. It has show-off economy features – a stop-start engine for when you’re stationary – but is not structurally economical: some pointy-head has calculated that it’s 24p dearer per mile than an equivalent Bimmer, a sum so painful that, once you knew it, you’d visualise on every journey [see footnote]. So, on that basis alone, it fails its own challenge, which is to lure people from cars they know better with some magic combination of instant dependability and enticing newness. There’s going to be no brand exodus away from similar motors in the 40k bracket. Having established that I’ll never be called upon to buy one, I started to enjoy it. At low speeds, it can feel a bit dieselly and reluctant, but it cuts up from 30 to 70 with so much enthusiasm, it felt like g-force. Something about that power, and the driving position, gave me a zen-like sense that I was inhabiting the spirit of the car, driving it forwards by force of mind. What’s 24p to a person who has reached a state of telepathy with a car? It also has an indefinable road presence, partly because it is unfamiliar, so it takes more than an instant for people to figure out how expensive it must be; and partly because, being rather broad, it’s zippier than it looks. People spin round as you pass, with a look as if they’ve just been overtaken by a fat cyclist. There are some classy dashboard features, too: a touchscreen large enough to watch a film on (variously occupied by the satnav and the stereo), and a stop-start button instead of a key insert. I found this counter-intuitive, like changing a cashpoint so the money comes out before the card. Naturally, people will adapt, but a lot of people will forget their cards in the meantime, and I forgot to turn off the engine (but only once). I was not expecting that I’d sink into the seat and it would smell like James Bond, all high-quality fibres and Acqua di Parma, but it did feel a bit plasticky. That said, I was impressed by how well it all stacked together, the way it was one step ahead of me at every turn, clocking light drizzle, ready with an ambient temperature, full of seven-gear automatic confidence.

I find a bit of yodelling helps. There is a woman called Mary Schneider, who yodels the classics: listen to her Wilhelm Tell Overture and I guarantee it’ll put you in a good mood. I shower, exfoliate, shave and moisturise, which doesn’t take long. It’s the deciding what to wear that takes the time. I try things on, and what might look good in the bathroom mirror doesn’t look good in the bedroom mirror, so I change my mind a lot. I drive myself mad with it, and there’s usually a pile of clothes on the bed while I eventually go back to what I started with. Depending on where I am going, I dress from my own wardrobe in my bedroom or my showbiz wardrobe in the basement. If I’ve got to appear on stage, it will be the showbiz wardrobe: the stuff people expect me to wear – sequined jackets and jewel-encrusted shoes. But if I’m off-duty, its the upstairs wardrobe. My current favourite is an Issey Miyake black suit: it’s comfortable and light. Sometimes there’s a bit of crossover and I run up and down the stairs. Eyes are very important, so I do a bit of eyelash curling, a bit of hiding the blemishes, and put some powder on. It looks like I’ve made an effort, but not like I’m wearing makeup. I’m least pleased with my posture. I tend to slouch, so have to remind myself to keep my shoulders back. Try to get a compliment off someone before you leave, to boost the confidence. I also like to put a limit on the evening. I can be jolly and extrovert for three hours, so at 8pm I tell myself I will be home by 11pm and it will be over. • Julian Clary is playing Cinderella at the Grand Theatre, Wolverhampton, until 18 January.",,,

Going hungry is often the least worst option. But tucked underneath Bristol Temple Meads station, Hart’s Bakery offers slow-fermented sourdough respite from that world of drab Upper Crust baguettes. Housed in a coolly utilitarian railway arch, this is a working bakery: there’s a lot of sexy, stainless-steel kit and basic, school-canteen seating. As well as knocking-out top-end breads for local delis and restaurants, each day the team rustle up a small array of glossy croissants, awesome cakes (try the custard tarts), hifalutin sandwiches and soups to eat in or take away. The buttery, fist-sized sausage rolls are a fennel-spiked, artery-clogging joy and the bakery’s occasionally seen cauliflower cheese pasties are – like that last lingering kiss with a new lover – worth missing your connection for. Arch 35, Lower Approach Road, hartsbakery.co.uk  TN My food vice… Saveloys You always want what you can’t have. Me, I just wanted to eat a saveloy. I can remember watching in awe as Terry McCann wolfed one down on his way to meet Arthur Daley on Minder, and every time I heard one referenced on television – usually as a euphemism, complete with cheeky wink – my urge to sample one became stronger. But they didn’t exist in my native Belfast, being an “English thing”, apparently. So, within the first few days of my move to London, it was straight round to the local chippy for a taster. I still recall the moment I bit through the bright red plastic-like skin into the meaty paste within, finally realising my long-held ambition, and being suddenly compelled to shout “Oi oi saveloy!” while doing the Lambeth Walk. But what this new kid in town actually did was rush home in a panic to Google whether saveloy skin was actually safe to eat. Talk about a magical moment spoiled. PB Jo Fuertes-Knight on food It’s weird how sucking on the burning corpse of a dead plant turns your mouth into a graveyard. It’s now been a year since I stopped smoking (sorry Mum), which was also around the time I started to notice some nuance in what I was consuming. Like coffee. Turns out there is (annoyingly) a difference between the barista stuff and mainlining instant Nescafé. More importantly, I rediscovered the joys of fruit over, say, the joys of Domino’s mozzarella sticks. What had become a chore became nature’s candy: one week, I ate pineapple till my lips were swollen, and satsumas finally stopped tasting like balls of bin juice. So, if not for reversing greying arteries and the threat of cancer, the greatest gift you can give yourself this year is to stop smoking – and regain the joy of stuffing your face.",profile/tonynaylor,Tony,Naylor

Based on his wife Jane’s memoir, it’s a relatively conventional study of a highly unconventional marriage – the impact of Hawking’s motor neurone disease and his rising scientific celebrity both binding the couple together and splitting them apart over the decades. Birdman (15) (Alejandro González Iñárritu, 2014, US) Michael Keaton, Edward Norton. 119 mins    Habitual misery-monger Iñárritu lightens up for once – so much so the camera takes flight, whisking us through this backstage tragicomedy in one apparently continuous take. Keaton commits himself bracingly to a part only he could play: a self-absorbed actor best known for his superhero roles, now seeking to reset his reputation with a serious, arty theatre production. But he’s beset by demons real and imagined in the form of rival actors, producers, family, lovers, not to mention his own delusions. Packed with showbiz satire and black comedy, it’s an invigorating, unclassifiable ride. Enemy (15) (Denis Villeneuve, 2013, Can/Spa) Jake Gyllenhaal, Mélanie Laurent, Sarah Gadon, Isabella Rossellini. 90 mins    Gyllenhaal is beside himself, literally, when he discovers by chance that he has a doppelganger, and sets about finding him. When he tracks down Gyllenhaal No 2, the mystery only deepens. Based on José Saramago’s novel, but with nods to David Lynch and Kafka, this haunting, hallucinatory head-scratcher is more interested in sustaining an atmosphere of ominous dread than providing straight answers. The Woman In Black: Angel Of Death (15) (Tom Harper, 2014, UK) Helen McCrory, Phoebe Fox, Jeremy Irvine. 98 mins    The magnificently creepy Eel Marsh House pays host to a group of evacuee children, 40 years after the events of the first film. Expect a repeat onslaught of shocks and gothic dread from Hammer’s horror sequel, against a backdrop of wartime anxiety. The Green Ray (12A) (Eric Rohmer, 1986, Fra) Marie Rivière, Vincent Gauthier, Amira Chemakhi. 96 mins    Rohmer’s rich, wise, playful study of a modern single woman and her search for companionship, a decent summer holiday, or simply something to alleviate her boredom. Like the best of his work, it’s beautifully simple yet satisfyingly complex. Dying Of The Light (18) (Paul Schrader, 2014, US/Bah) Nicolas Cage, Anton Yelchin, Alexander Karim. 92 mins    Diagnosed with dementia, Cage’s CIA veteran goes on a renegade global manhunt for the terrorist who tortured him 20 years earlier – with protege Yelchin in tow. Despite the promise of a vintage unhinged Cage role, and a critique of US foreign policy, the movie was apparently taken out of Schrader’s hands and re-edited – into a bit of a mess.

Despite working with all the craftiness of a ceramicist, Wine is more like a sculptor than any kind of potter. Here, fragments of a lifesize pottery self-portrait are suspended from the ceiling like Alexander Calder’s kinetic sculpture. With disarming self-parody, the artist is portrayed as a disembodied pair of underpants dangling among the typical paraphernalia of the studio. There’s a ceramic knife, a ceramic bottle of wine and glasses, a ceramic pair of Reebok Classic trainers, even a clay sculpture of a bag of clay. Each prop is daubed and smeared with a bright and shiny glaze that envelops it in a comic lightheartedness. Wine displays a classic characteristic of the fine artist: doing things wrongly on purpose. An anti-potter, he reminds us that pottery is, after all, malleable muck; something that’s scooped up and fired for fancy dining. BALTIC, to 15 Feb Trove, Dublin The Irish artist Dorothy Cross goes in for hybrid assemblages of fur, skins and bits of furniture. Hers is a ritualised art, a collecting together of disparate elements to conjure an otherworldly reality. Here, the IMMA has invited her to curate artworks and collectables from some of Ireland’s best-stocked galleries and museums. Typically, she avoids chronological or categorical ordering, and sets things together just to see what magic sparks might be struck. So, there’s a two-metre high portrait by Thomas Ruff, a shark’s tooth, a hummingbird’s nest, and a Patrick Scott gold-leaf abstract: all reminding us that one of the purposes of museums is to provide a space for wonderment. Irish Museum Of Modern Art, to 1 Mar Haunted House, Blackpool In a suitably moody little show for winter, the Grundy presents a selection of spook art. Despite the Victorian get-up and a programme of horror film nights and family-friendly drawing workshops, the show has a serious curatorial agenda, and includes work by such international contemporary art big shots as Martin Creed, Graham Gussin, Susan Hiller and Olivier Castel. Works include an etching of a shrouded sexton from David Hockney’s Brothers Grimm-based illustrations, and there’s also the video for which Susan Philipsz won the 2010 Turner Prize, a plaintive recording of a disembodied voice singing a ballad. The Grundy has long been rumoured to be haunted; indeed, packed with evocative presences of absent subjects, don’t all galleries seem to be? Grundy Art Gallery, to 17 Jan Stanley Royle, Sheffield Stanley Royle might have lived into the 1960s, but his artistic output remained firmly entrenched in the late 19th century. Indeed, it is this which constitutes its retro-romantic charm. If you forget about the obligation for art to be experimental and innovative – the need for it to avoid derivative cultural cliches – then Royle’s vision of the landscape as an escapist playground comes across as just about believable. The populist, down-to-earth David Hockney of his day, Royle borrowed the sun-drenched palette of the French impressionists and adapted it to reference the darker skies of industrial Sheffield and the heather-dotted wilds of the nearby Derbyshire moors. Considering what the atmospheric state of the steel city was like during the early days of the 20th century, Royle’s brushwork tapestries of violet and turquoise shadows can be read as aesthetic lies, but they’re lovely ones nevertheless.

It was taken in Devon on a family holiday last summer. It was quite job getting all the young ones to gather and pose for the picture. All the grandchildren came along after my husband died. All my children got married after my husband died. There have been so many wonderful occasions since Alan died – including my son’s heart transplant four years ago. I thought I would be terribly sad when I became a grandmother because I wouldn’t have Alan with me. I would have to be a grandmother on my own – no Granddad to accompany me. But I was wrong. I wasn’t sad. I was overjoyed. Absolutely overjoyed. I was there at my first grandchild’s birth. I even helped hold one of my daughter’s legs while she pushed her son into this world. That was in 2005. Come 2008, two more grandsons arrived safely, and in 2009, two further grandchildren breathed themselves into life. In 2010, dear, sweet baby George did not arrive safely. In 2011, two more grandchildren followed. In 2012, on Valentine’s day, another beautiful grandchild arrived, late but safe. Then in 2013, the twins were born. The joys, the ups and downs, the worry, the fear and the hardship of being a solo grandparent is a struggle at times. And the sorrow; the deep sorrow of doing it on my own. When I’m out and about, I may hear a child calling out for their granddad, or I’ll hear grannies and nannies saying, “Go and ask granddad”, and I hear these innocent words with such pain. Because we have no granddad and it is a reminder that he isn’t here. The most painful thing for me is that my grandchildren will have no memory at all of their granddad, because they never met him. They will have no stories to tell others about how their granddad taught them to play cards, or build a boat, or make a paper hat or, how granddad fell asleep with his mouth open while eating ice-cream. Another one of my hurts is that Alan never saw his children (our children) become parents themselves. It is an amazing thing when your own child has a baby. Look at how everyone rejoices when newlyweds say: “We’re pregnant!” Seeing my sons become fathers and my daughters become mothers has been one of the greatest pleasures in my life. I know that grief is a living thing. It never dies. Nor should it, because we need it to help us live our lives fully. Without it, we would not greet the joy and love of life as we do. And my family, with all its little ones, certainly fills my life with joy and love. Abundantly. June Crompton Playlist: The year I became a teen dancing queen Dancing Queen by Abba “You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life. See that girl, watch that scene, digging the dancing queen …”    My eldest brother, Tim, who was six years older than me, had a record player in his bedroom in the attic and, when he was out, I had special permission to use it. Whenever I hear that helter-skelter of notes from Dancing Queen sliding down the keyboard, it takes me back to the sultry summer of 1976, putting my single on the turntable in Tim’s bedroom, moving the black arm across and hearing the hiss and bump of the needle as it made contact with the vinyl. During that summer, as a heatwave coincided with disco dancing fever, I and many of my friends became teenagers; slipping over the border from 12 into 13. Lots of us threw parties in local halls or at someone’s house to celebrate our admission to teenage territory. Boys and alcohol were strictly forbidden, but it was the dancing I loved. And as soon as the first notes of Dancing Queen rang out, we would assemble in a line in our high-waisted trousers and cap-sleeved T-shirts and execute the moves to Dancing Queen – moves I had been practising in Tim’s bedroom all week. All too soon, the evenings came to an end and our mums would materialise out of the kitchens or be waiting for us outside in their cars. Sometimes, Tim was tasked to come and pick me up in my parents’ Renault 12 and, whenever he did, he always teased me about being the dancing queen and sang snatches from the song all the way home. Secretly, I quite liked it. Liz Gwinnell We love to eat: Mum’s seriously scrumptious sponge Ingredients170g self-raising flour 170g caster sugar 240g butter 3 eggs Vanilla essence 115g icing sugar Milk 200g bar of chocolate Marshmallows, Maltesers, sprinkles, etc    Mum’s seriously scrumptious sponge. Photograph: Public Domain   In a bowl, mix together the self-raising flour and caster sugar and 170g butter. Beat in the eggs and a teaspoon of vanilla essence. Stir until you have a smooth mixture. Spoon the mix equally in to two 7in cake tins. Bake at 150C/gas mark 2 for 20 minutes. Leave to cool. For the buttercream filling, add 70g butter to the icing sugar and a few drops of vanilla essence to flavour. Beat together until smooth and creamy. Add a small amount of milk if necessary to loosen the mixture. Spread the filling on the inside of one of the cooled cake halves. Place the other cake half on top, insides together. For the topping, break a third of a 200g bar of chocolate into a glass bowl. Place the bowl on top of a saucepan of water and gently heat until the chocolate has melted. Spread the chocolate over the top of the cake. While the chocolate is still soft, decorate with marshmallows, Maltesers, hundreds and thousands, chocolate stars – anything you like. I loved it when Mum said she was going to make a sponge – especially licking out the bowl. She would sit me on the worktop and I would run my fingers round the bowl and slurp the gooey mixture. When I was about eight, I started to help Mum. Money was tight, so sometimes there would be only a little buttercream in the middle and a dusting of sugar on top. Perhaps that’s why, when I had my daughter, we packed everything we could into the cake. Often buttercream would be oozing over the sides and the toppings became more elaborate, crammed with tasty treats. I feel we have done Mum proud but, we both agree that there is nothing quite like Mum’s sponge.

He is also 20 years younger than me. Prior to his first message, he had looked at my profile almost every day for weeks, unaware or not bothered that the site notches up each viewing. What is he thinking, I asked myself each time he came back to my page; what’s he deciding? Is it the picture? Is it my age? The alpha control freak intellectual snob thing? Eventually, last weekend there was a message. It said: “Hello, how are you?” I told him, although it took five paragraphs, and a lot of rewrites. At the end of my answer, I asked how he was. He didn’t reply. So the next evening when he asked again, I sent him an even longer answer, with reference to meals eaten, energy levels, lengths swum, the working day and the outrageous cost of a Fry’s Chocolate Cream at the corner shop – 80p! That’s 16 shillings. (He took my quaint shilling talk in his stride, perhaps aware that it was intended to emphasise our age difference.) How was his day? I asked. No response. The next day, there he was again. “How are you today?” “I could tell you,” I wrote, irritably, “but what’s the point? You never talk back.” “You’re very attractive. Do you want to meet for dinner?” he replied. “Tonight?” I said I couldn’t, sorry. And besides I’d already eaten. (I hadn’t. It was a lie.) “So what are you doing now?” he typed. “Sprawled on the sofa with a book,” I wrote, unguardedly. “Mmm. I like the idea of you sprawled.” “Ha,” I typed back, unnerved. “But you are way too young for me.” “Girls bore me,” he wrote. “I’m more interested in women, real women like you. Looking forward to our first date. Saturday?” “I can’t this week,” I wrote. I was sure that Oliver would take one look at me and run, which was a pity, because in many respects he was absolutely what the doctor would have ordered, if the doctor was a middle-aged woman who hadn’t had sex for a long time. “Tell me more about yourself,” I persisted. “You can find out all about me over dinner,” he wrote. The next day, there he was again. “When we go to dinner, will you be wearing a skirt?” “Probably, or a dress. Why?” “Will it be short?” “Unlikely.” “Will you wear stockings, so I can put my hand under your skirt as we’re having a drink?” “That’s forward.” “I bet you have gorgeous long legs. Are they long?” “Not really.” I am way out of my depth here, I thought. “And will you wear heels?” “Probably not. I might wear heeled boots.” “Wear heels, a short skirt and stockings, just for me.” “Oliver, I’m not really a heels and stockings kind of a woman,” I wrote. “To be honest, I get kind of sick of all these cliches of femininity.” I knew this reply broke one of the iron laws of online dating – pomposity! – but I was sick of them. “I have total respect for that,” Oliver wrote. “It’s a good point.” A 30-second silence fell, while I contemplated his response, and he contemplated it also. I broke the silence. “Why aren’t you taking a woman your own age out to dinner?” “Women my own age want marriage and babies. I don’t want marriage and babies.” “Ah.” “Meet me.” “Not now. But some time. Maybe.” “You like to play hard to get, then.” “Hard to get? We’ve barely said hello. Tell me more about yourself. Something. Anything.” He didn’t reply and still hasn’t, but I continue to get messages almost every night wanting to know how I am. He never replies to my query about how he is. I’ve asked him twice why he keeps doing this: what’s in it for him? He doesn’t say. It’s mystifying.",profile/stella-grey,grey,stella
400,2015-01-03T06:30:10Z,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/03/life-before-and-after-facebook,Life before and after Facebook,lifeandstyle,Life and style,The Guardian,"There was a time when sending a misbehaving youngster off to their bedroom was viewed as a punishment. It was supposed to make them feel isolated and excluded; an admonishment to sit alone and reflect on their wrongdoing. For today’s average adolescent staying by themselves in their room is never a matter of being isolated and hardly feels like a punishment. Physical surroundings are meaningless because every teenager is now always in constant touch with their peers, and the world beyond, through ubiquitous devices. In fact, judging by my own household, for many teenagers their default position is to stay alone in their room staring at screens; playing games, messaging late into the night, sharing YouTube clips and multiple other diversions. They might emerge for meals and necessary sustenance, but they would generally prefer to  be locked away using technology to interact with others near and far. But how fast all this has changed. My three children are spread over eight years. The older daughter is in her late 20s and her teenage years now feel like a simpler time. Navigating these issues with her brother, who is 19, was much more complicated. Between them they have spanned the advent of social media and online communication. The eldest was only given her own phone at 14, which in 2002 was pretty average. And the phone itself was a basic Nokia pay-as–you-go. Facebook was still only a twinkle in Mark Zuckerberg’s eye and when it was invented in 2004 it was limited to Harvard University students. Like other parents, we gave her the phone rationalising that she was going by herself to school and elsewhere so it would be useful if she needed to be in touch. She used to eke out her £10 per month top-up allowance texting away to friends. She soon realised that communication was a two-way thing. We could now also contact her, asking where she was and reminding her to return on time – so all too often when she was out late and we tried reaching her the phone trailed on to voicemail. “Sorry had no signal or the battery ran out” were the frequent explanations, when she had clearly chosen that it was inconvenient to her plans to be in touch. By the time my youngest, Ben, left primary school having a phone at age 11 for the start of solo school journeys was standard. Most children without a mobile by this stage would be insisting to their parents that they were missing out. Meanwhile, the gadgets themselves, never mind all the multiple online possibilities, have been transformed. I struggled with him to get my head round the ever-changing social media sites – the pervasive pornography, the advent of Snapchat, Instagram, WhatsApp and the prospect of continual online interaction – sometimes even, weirdly, as a substitute for real life. I remember when I first saw him on Facebook exchanging messages with his friend who lived just down our road – “Why don’t you talk to each other rather than communicating through the computer?” – he shrugged and rolled his eyes. By then it was too late to question what he was even doing on Facebook, which was supposedly restricted to older teens? Like his friends, he had “adjusted” his birth year when he joined, to circumvent the age limit for opening a Facebook account – which was never challenged. Even so, he still did not have his own laptop in the early teenage years – and often left windows open on the family desktop. If I was using it later I might have sight of what he had been looking at and his conversations. Sometimes I was unhappy about sites he had visited and my husband and I would challenge him. But, of course, once he had a laptop in his room that no longer happened because how would we ever know? Yet it’s not just the teenage bedroom that has morphed, the whole concept of the home is different in this era of online and social media. Remember the time when you arrived back from school? The only prospect of connection to your peers, unless you had arranged to meet up with someone, was speaking to them on the single family phone handset. In many homes, and certainly in my case, it sat in a draughty hallway, where everyone could overhear the conversation. Worse still, parents would interrupt to complain about the mounting bill or to insist that they needed access to the phone for their own call. And once the lingering chat with a friend or two was over, there was no further external contact until the next morning’s journey to school. The family home was almost a retreat. It might have been boring for a teenager, fed up with her family and desperate to be in touch with her friends, but it was also a kind of sanctuary. The intensity of continually interacting – the adolescent obsession of measuring who is up and who is down – had to take an overnight break. Now the multiple conversations never stop. Late into the night teens are posting pictures, making comments, sharing links; the pressures of being cool and part of the action are a 24/7 activity.    Suzanne and her daughters, Hannah and Emma Photograph: Sarah Lee/Guardian   Fear of missing out (Fomo) has always been a teenage obsession. Most have little sense of proportion, so the thought of not attending a party or a gathering with everyone else can make them frantic. But now Fomo never stops. There is not only the party but all the social media noise that follows – posting photos, sizing up what did or did not happen. Children are reluctant to admit it, but after a bad day at school it might be a relief to have a place where the online world cannot reach you. The problem is whether the home can any longer offer that peace and quiet. It is as if the walls are no longer solid but permeable. Somehow the outside world now penetrates inside the average family home because of this continual contact with peers and others. The days of a single family landline had another advantage. Parents still had some notion of who their children were interacting with. They might answer the call or even take a message. Today, unless there is no signal, few teens would resort to speaking on a fixed landline – there is no need. But my two older daughters are just about from the end of that quaint era. I recall when my second daughter was 11 or 12, the same boy, Leo, would call every day at 5.20pm and the conversation always lasted for ages. I still tried to enforce a rule about no phone chatting until homework and music practice were all done (except of course when they insisted that they must consult a friend about the homework). Sometimes when Leo rang I would say she was busy and ask if she could return the call or if he could ring back later – often wondering, “Don’t you have any homework yourself to finish?” Nowadays that would be a joke – no child would dream of calling up on a landline, to be intercepted by irritating parents – all communication is direct. Leo is now a successful whiz-kid in Silicon Valley, even profiled last month in the Guardian, so maybe disrupted homework never did him any harm. But what about switching off? Once I became aware of the continuing late-night activity I insisted that my son leave his mobile outside the bedroom at night. I had tried asking him to switch it off after hours – but the temptation was too great. Sometimes I would find he had even crept out to retrieve the phone from the landing in the wee hours. Once there was wifi throughout the house, we resorted to unplugging the router late at night. Of course, the downside was that no one else could go online. Anyway that strategy was ruined when 3G and 4G arrived. Now those tussles have faded and I hope that my children have developed sufficient self-control to know when to switch off and tune out of the online frenzy. Alas, how many adults cannot disconnect, pore over their devices at every moment and, most annoyingly, leave them out on the table during mealtimes, like a nearby lifeline?

My uncle Arthur was a military man who had fought in the second world war, a Daily Express reader who voted for Margaret Thatcher, while in the late 1970s and 1980s I was a CND-supporting, leftwing student and punk fan. Arthur had no time for “nutcases like Wedgie Benn and Arthur Scargill” and wasn’t sympathetic to my support to the People’s March for Jobs in 1981. In one of his many letters to me, he wrote: “The people who took part in the Jarrow marches really were starving. Your lot only walked about six miles a day and were treated like celebrities, and wined and dined wherever they went. I walked further than that out of Burma during the war and got bombed and shot at on the way.” But although we might have differed in our views, Arthur was always open to debate. Whereas my dad would get angry at any radical opinions, Arthur would write: “While I do not agree with your views I would defend to the death your right to hold them. Which is something similar to a Voltaire quotation. You must accede that your uncle is, for his age, quite an erudite guy.” Arthur was married to my mum’s sister Audrey and once a year we visited them in Stoke-on-Trent and then they’d come to Essex a few months later. In my teenage years Arthur was enjoying an easy retirement after working as an architect, smoking cigarettes, visiting the pub and playing Frank Sinatra records. He had no children but Arthur enjoyed dispensing advice to his nephews and nieces. Seventy years ago, in 1944, my uncle Arthur would have been fighting in India and Burma with the Corps of Royal Engineers. During my childhood he would reveal the odd aphorism from his second world war experiences. He mentioned that the best meal he ever had was a slice of bread and jam after a three-day march through the jungles of Burma. He said that whether you believe in God or not, when someone fires at you in battle, you pray. The only time he’d killed a man, as far as he knew, was when he’d fired at a sniper in a tree and the body of a Japanese soldier had dropped to the ground. In India, he’d fried eggs on the pavement and recalled with horror seeing a beggar from the untouchable class poisoned by Indians from a different caste and the death being treated as a joke. He once said: “If you’ve seen some of the things I’ve seen, like a dog eating the skin from a human head …”    Punk fan and nuclear disarmament supporter … teenage Pete May. Photograph: Pete May   It wasn’t uncle Arthur’s wartime experiences that I found most valuable though; it was the letters we exchanged through my teens and 20s. They are still in my attic. He addressed them to “Mr JPS May BA (Hons)” after I graduated, and on the back, he’d write in fountain pen ink, “From: Hon Capt EA Mountford RE ARIBA.” His letters and my replies were written in a playful cod-literary style. He’d use words such as erudite, diatribe, intelligentsia and sojourn, and apologise for “sounding like the Oracle of Delphi”. Where Arthur was most supportive was in the ongoing battle I had with my father, who was adamant that I had to follow him into dairy farming. My uncle told me I had the right to choose my own career. Arthur could even bring some humour to the subject: “I had an interesting talk with your father when we went out for our bevvy. I thought I had made a strong psychological impact on some of his thoughts. On reflection I might as well have been talking to my half-empty glass … I’m sure he knows his own job very well and he is an extremely astute businessman, but doesn’t know much about personal relations and neither you nor anyone else will ever change him. Your best tactic is to get your degree and then please yourself … You had better eat or burn this letter because if your dad ever sees it we will not be welcome at the farm ever again!” His general advice was to keep quiet and, “remember your mum has a great regard for you, so show some affection and ring her up de temps en temps”. Arthur was encouraging throughout the early 1980s, when I was often unemployed. “It must be very depressing for young people like you in these difficult times. Though I still admire her, I think Mrs Thatcher is so hooked on bringing inflation down she’s ruining the country in the process. Nobody (including Arthur Scargill) seems to know the answer. I think the whole problem started after WW2 and no politician of either party had the vision to look ahead with any perspicacity.”    Above all, Arthur encouraged me to try my hand at writing. “The chances are not great, but you never know. Take a tip from me and stick to writing books in your spare time, because I’ve got a sneaking suspicion that you could with a bit of luck hit the jackpot.” After being told to take it easy after a minor stroke in 1981, Arthur was happy to admit: “I can’t take life any more easily than I have done for the past four years since, being bone idle, I have done nothing more energetic than mowing the lawn, cutting the hedges and cleaning the windows.” Sadly Arthur’s lifestyle of lunchtime pints, evening drams and smoking all day eventually caught up with him. As he wrote: “Tempus seems to fugit faster the older one gets. I was 28 when I left the army and Audrey and I were married. That to you, must seem almost prehistoric!” Arthur was partially paralysed on his right-hand side after a bad stroke in 1985. He was no longer able to write his own letters, but was able to read some of my early forays into journalism, and to be impressed that I had a new-fangled device called an answerphone. He died in his sleep in the summer of 1987, aged 69. Now all I have are memories of his wartime anecdotes, a picture he painted for his mother on my office wall and a bunch of letters addressed to me in his elegant handwriting. Nobody sends letters much anymore and I find it sad that my children might find it harder to have the same depth of slow correspondence with a relative via instant emails, texts, Facebook and Skyping. Or perhaps the gap between parents and children has narrowed and there is less need for thoughtful advice from relatives now. Whatever the case, I’m thankful for what Arthur did to preserve our freedom in the second world war, but I’m also grateful for what he did for me in peacetime and his influence on my life and writing through his letters. He was indeed, “quite an erudite guy”. Pete May is author of The Joy of Essex, published by Robson Press",,,

How could your new husband, your best friend and the kindest, gentlest man we knew be facing such a thing? You remained strong, though, while we all went slightly crazy. You knew he wanted to remain at home and, despite all the difficulties you faced, were determined that his wish would be honoured, and it was. Once away from hospital he seemed to thrive. You made the best of what time you had left. He loved you for it and the pair of you set out to have fun and make even more wonderful memories. Your friends from the village have always taken you two to their hearts and were amazing. Help was always on hand. The garden was kept tidy, the fridge replenished, the washing dried and the dog walked. An arm to guide him home after a trip to his favourite place (we all know where that was!). Friends sorted the Christmas tree and midnight calls for assistance were met with an instant response – always positive. I was so proud as you cared and supported him. In those last days you knew what was coming and faced it head-on with such dignity. During those last hours you held your lovely husband in your arms, snuggled up in bed, just how you both wanted it and how it should have been. In the final hours, while the medical professionals bickered outside, you held him close, stroking his head and gently guiding him through. I know he felt no pain, no anguish or fear; he responded to your voice and looked completely at peace. Such love I have never seen, and it shone like a beacon in those sometimes very dark times. The world knew it and loved you both for it. You supported me when I faltered, you held me when I cried. You were brave and considerate when I was cynical and angry. You forgave and were generous when I was not. I learned so much from you, my lovely girl. The love you have was made in heaven and, although it doesn’t feel like it now, in time you will overcome the sadness and grief and your beautiful light will shine again – brighter for having known Mark. We hoped this Christmas would be a special time – but it was not to be. It will, though, have been filled with love and snuggles, with sisters, babies and friends, and with lots of love. Our boy, your husband, will be in our hearts, where he will remain for ever. You had something that most of us can only dream about. Be sad, but remember that “Nibs” is soooo watching you … with a smile on his face and those beautiful blue eyes twinkling. That I know for sure. Love, Mum",,,
403,2015-01-03T07:00:11Z,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jan/03/dear-jeremy-work-issues-solved,Dear Jeremy – your work issues solved,money,Money,The Guardian,"I was advised to temp, but as a result it’s impossible to find a permanent position My university careers service told me in 2008 that the best way to gain enough experience to get a permanent job was to take on temporary work. Since then, that’s what I’ve been doing. I am beginning to lose track of the half-decade of temp work I’ve had, all over local councils and varying public service administration. Last year I was lucky enough to be sent on a post that has lasted for more than a year – but they kicked me out at Christmas. I’m finding temporary experience is worth nothing. Everyone dismisses my applications with the message that, in their eyes, I’ve never worked.  I’m fed up with temping. People are friendly but I’m forever reminded I’m not one of them. I’ve been let go several times for getting a cold in winter. I don’t get references, which is another hindrance. Temp-to-permanent does not exist any more; the agencies are vicious; and my Christmas present this year is unemployment again. Is there anything I can do with my temping when only permanent will do? Jeremy says This is a dispiriting story. The advice you were given all those years ago may have been sound enough then, but it clearly hasn’t served you well. However, the skill with which you’ve described your predicament suggests at least one approach that might help you to break out of this self-perpetuating cycle. What you’ve learned over these years of working for a multitude of different organisations, must be extraordinary; and potentially, to a few thoughtful employers, extremely valuable. I suggest you spend quite a few hours recalling and listing the best and the worst employment practices you’ve encountered. I’m certainly not suggesting a catalogue of criticism; more an intelligent analysis of simple things that employers get wrong, with an equal analysis of things they get right. You don’t need to name names. In this way, I believe, you can turn your many years of temping into a positive advantage. You will have seen the inside of many more organisations than any permanent employee – and will be able to share that with any company sensible enough to take you on. From the style of your letter, I believe you’re more than capable of conducting such an exercise – and incorporating a taster of it in all your future applications. You might even enjoy doing it. It will certainly mark you out from all the others. Readers say • The next time a possible employer tells you that, in their eyes, your experience is worth nothing and that you have never worked, you smile sweetly, take a deep breath and tell them all that you have learned since leaving uni and how this will make an essential difference to their organisation. Aranzazu • Don’t stick to the public sector – it’s been shrinking since 2008 and there are fewer and fewer permanent roles. A sector making a third of its workforce redundant is not looking to recruit. Horatio93 • Make sure that you are emphasising all your skills in your CV rather than a list of positions and duties. jewell79 • From my perspective as an employer, it wouldn’t be the temporary nature of the work itself that was a problem, rather the impression this might give that either you’re not good enough to get a permanent job, or you are a bit of a fly-by-night person not willing to settle to anything. SParr3 My job is fantastic, but hours of unpaid overtime are now taking their toll  I have worked in a small architects’ office for the past eight years. It has fantastic advantages – flexible hours, a family friendly boss (I am a single parent of two teens), interesting work and only a five-minute commute. I know I am incredibly lucky.  However, I do quite lot of unpaid overtime. Because of the nature of the work, and the fact that my role is to produce drawings, I often need to do longer hours to meet deadlines. We are often seriously behind, so I do many extra hours, voluntarily. My boss sometimes does not draw a wage, so I find it hard to ask for more pay, and time in lieu is not practical. The long hours do not suit my family life. I have not had a raise in some years due to the recession. I was on a 20-hour week, but last year, due to an unmanageable workload and the welcome chance to earn more money, I suggested doing a 30-hour week. My boss agreed immediately. However, it was hard to juggle my family life, so last month I reduced it to 25. Over a year, I do about 15% extra hours unpaid and while I don’t mind doing some extra, they are usually compressed into about a third of the year. In addition, I resent the fact that the administrator is on the same pro rata wage. He takes extended holidays, quite often arrives late, leaves early and takes personal and sick days. When the boss is not there, the administrator does his own personal business, sometimes spending the whole day at it or meeting friends for an extended lunchtime drink. Should I tell my boss? They are quite good friends. And should I ask for a wage review?  Jeremy says The combination of working for a small, friendly company and your own super-conscientious personality is a dangerous one: it means you hesitate before making an entirely reasonable request for a salary review. I’d be pretty certain that your boss feels you’re so committed to his company that he can, more or less, take you for granted. I’d also be pretty certain he’d be devastated to lose you: he knows he can trust you to perform an absolutely critical and skilled function. Forget the fact that he sometimes doesn’t pay himself – and forget the administrator’s behaviour: they’re nothing to do with your own case. Keep any sense of injustice you may feel well-hidden and don’t even imply that you might leave: it shouldn’t be necessary. Just make your request for an increase quite unapologetically – formally, in writing, with facts and dates to support your case. You’re worth it. Readers say • If you’re doing 29 hours of work a week but being paid for 25, I suggest you ask for a zero-hours contract where you’re paid by the hour, at the same rate as at present. This will give you the flexibility that you and your employer both need, while ensuring that you’re paid for the hours you work. DrPlokta • As your employer readily agreed to increasing your hours to 30 when you suggested it, perhaps s/he would be amenable to paying overtime for the hours worked over the current agreed 25. walkinginthesand • If you are working more than the hours you are paid to work you should be compensated. Don’t worry too much about whether your boss is occasionally not drawing a wage; assuming he is the owner of the business, he is treating it as a long-term investment; for you this is your monthly income. And if your admin colleague is a friend of the boss you don’t know what arrangement they have, so I wouldn’t make too much of it. It only becomes an issue if it is disrupting your ability to do your work. ollybenson Do you need advice on a work issue?

404,2015-01-03T07:00:11Z,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jan/03/self-assessment-tax-return-file-online-deadline-penalties,Act now on tax returns to keep HMRC off your back,money,Money,The Guardian,"Now the festivities are over there’s one less excuse for failing to submit your online tax return on time. Leave it until after midnight on 31 January – when you also have to pay any tax you owe for the 2013-14 financial year – and you will be hit with an automatic £100 late return penalty and, if you keep delaying, any additional penalties can tot up to £1,600. Most people who are required to file a self-assessment tax return, including the self-employed and those with more complex tax affairs – such as those earning money from rents or investments above a certain level – will know about it well in advance of the deadlines. HM Revenue and Customs usually sends out tax returns in April, at the end of the tax year to which they apply. If you received a return for the tax year 2013-14, which ended on 5 April 2014, you are too late to file by post. The deadline for that was 31 October. Your only option now is to go online which has the advantage of a later deadline – 31 January - as well as automatic calculations and on-screen help as you work your way through. To send an online tax return you must be registered for HMRC online services and that involves getting an “activation code” by post, which will take a few days to arrive. So if you haven’t already got one, register as soon as possible at online.hmrc.gov.uk/registration/individual. While you are waiting, it is a good idea to tackle the time-consuming task of getting together all the financial documentation you will need including, for example, bank statements, savings and investment statements and details of all sources of income received during the tax year. Once your code arrives you must activate your account within 28 days. To do so, you will need your postcode or national insurance number and your 10-digit unique taxpayer reference (UTR) number. If you have registered for self assessment, you can find it on your tax return or “notice to complete a tax return” from HMRC. If you have trouble signing up to file online, call the HMRC online services helpdesk on 0300 200 3600. If you have previously registered, but since lost your user ID, you can request a new one online if you have your UTR number and password. It is central to the self-assessment system that individuals have to contact their tax office if they do not receive a self-assessment return but think they should, or if their financial circumstances change. You have six months from when the tax year ends on 5 April to report any new income. For example, if you become self-employed you have three months after the calendar month in which you start your work to let HMRC know. If you are unsure whether you need to fill in a self-assessment return, you can check using an online tool at gov.uk/check-if-you-need-a-tax-return. If you are registered for self-assessment, you normally pay any tax owed in twice-yearly instalments: 31 January is the deadline for paying the balance of any tax owed for the year ending the previous 5 April. It is also the date by which a taxpayer must make any first “payment on account” (advance payment) for the current tax year. So on 31 January a taxpayer may have to pay both the balancing payment for the year 2014-15 and the first payment on account for 2015-16. Separate from penalties for late filing of your tax return are penalties for late payment of any tax owing for 2013-14. Over 30 days late in paying and you are charged 5% of the tax unpaid at that date. Leave it more than six months to pay any tax you owe for 2013-14 and you will have to pay an additional 5% of the tax unpaid at that date; leaving it more than 12 months means a further penalty of 5% of the tax unpaid at that date. Interest is also charged on all outstanding amounts, including any unpaid penalties, until payment is received in full.",profile/jillpapworth,Jill,Papworth

Photograph: Bon Appetit/Alamy   Milky lattes, wine and processed ready meals are all shockingly high in calories and expensive additions to your weekly shop says dietician and nutritionist, Azmina Govindji. “Swapping your daily [shop-bought] latte fix for a homemade black coffee can instantly save you on both fronts.” For example a regular Starbucks latte costs £2.25 and contains 143 calories, over five days that’s £11.25 spent and 715 calories consumed. A report from the Royal Society for Public Health highlighted the number of calories we consume when drinking wine, our favourite tipple. It equated drinking a large glass of wine (250ml, 13% abv alcohol) to eating a Cornetto ice cream – both have 228 calories in them.  A standard glass (175ml, 13% abv alcohol) has comparable calories to a slice of madeira cake (160). “Calories in alcohol are high. You get around seven calories per gram of alcohol. To put that in perspective you get around four calories per gram of sugar,” she says. By cutting out a small glass of wine a night you can save 1,100 calories a week – make it a large glass and it’s 1,600 calories – or weight loss of 2lb in a month. Britain leads the world in consumption of ready meals, spending around £3.3bn a year on the 12,000 varieties on supermarket shelves. Govindji, who spearheads the NHS Choices’ Eat4Cheap challenge, says that by ditching ready meals and switching to home cooked food you can cut your weekly shopping bill by as much as half. Of those who took the challenge, “No one said it was easy,” she said. “But by cooking in bulk, eating leftovers and having things like scrambled eggs and homemade soup, the participants improved their health and bank balance too.” Cutting down on takeaways, choosing cheaper brands and reducing waste, families can save up to £2,650 a year on food alone. The NHS Choices website shows households how to make these savings and get the recommended five a day for less than 50p too. Take up running    Running may not be enough. Photograph: Alamy   For the cost of a cheap pair of trainers you can run straight from your front door, it’s that simple. Or is it? For many, lack of motivation is the biggest barrier to leaving the house. If you don’t want to run on your own, try joining 50,000 runners on a Saturday morning at a Parkrun event. Find one near you at parkrun.org.uk.  These are free, weekly timed five-kilometre runs held around the country at 9am. They’re open to everyone. “It doesn’t matter how fit, how old or what gender you are. We try to make it inclusive,” says Parkrun’s Danny Norman. A runner of 10 years, he says they even have volunteer “towel walkers” who stay with the last person so no one is left behind. Going to the same venue each week gives you “an apples for apples litmus test and it’s a good way to track your fitness,” he says. Parkrun monitors a runner’s personal best but Norman says this isn’t people’s sole motivation: “The biggest reason for people coming to Parkrun is to do with the community at large It’s about people running with others in a safe, inclusive environment.”  The organisation regularly receives thank-you letters from newly converted runners Norman says: “For some people, five kilometres is the furthest they’ve run since cross country in school 40 years ago. We get letters saying it used to be a form of punishment and now I’m doing Parkrun for fun.” It’s fair to say running 5km once a week will not shed the pounds, (on average you only burn 300 calories on a run) but, says Norman, combining it with reducing calories is a healthy way to start losing weight. “If you just did 5km every week and your diet stayed the same you’re not going to lose weight. If you’re putting in more than what you’re burning off – you could run six times a week – it’s still going to be detrimental to you. The established rule of thumb for people starting off is three runs a week.”  Download the app    An app can help. Photograph: PR   Research says that you are more likely to lose weight if you keep track of what you eat.  There are hundreds of tracker apps to choose from in the app store, but MyFitnessPal is regarded as the best. For a start it’s free. By adding your personal stats (height, age, gender, weight etc) and weight loss goal the app will work out how many calories you can have each day to reach your -target within a set time.  It has a database of more than 2m foods to track plus a recipe counter (where you can upload ingredients in your meal) and the app will work out the calories you’ve eaten.  It charts your progress in a graph and gives you the option to sign up to its online community for support and motivation.  Nicola Read, 37, a TEFL teacher based in Thailand, says: “I use it to remind myself of calorie values, calorific burn rates of different exercise regimes as well as the necessary proportions for ‘proper’ balanced meals and portion control. It’s easy to use, free and it sends through great recipes.” Of the other tracking apps Runkeeper and Endomondo come highly recommended by the editor of tech website Wareable, Paul Lamkin.  He says: “Both are free and great for people who are just beginning to run.” They work by using the GPS from your smartphone – which has tracking capabilities that says exactly where you’ve been – so you don’t need to buy an expensive running watch. “Endomondo has a strong community feel to it. You can track your steps, your runs, calories and get to see how other Endomondo users are doing and achieving,” he says. Novice runner and chemist from the University of York, Rob McElroy, 36, has been using another free app, Mapmyrun, for almost three years and has found it a really motivating fitness tool. “In the beginning I liked it simply because it let me know how far I’d run and how fast. As it has evolved I really enjoy getting real time feedback and how I’ve fared against myself and others,” he says. Buy the book Often cited in the top 10 best selling diet books, the 5:2 Fast Diet devised by Michael Mosely and co-authored by Mimi Spencer, is a low access point for a diet. There are no clubs to attend, added extras or expensive diet products to buy says Spencer.  “People have dubbed it the ‘austerity diet’ because you’re not only cutting your calories but also your costs two days a week,” she says. Recent research from Visa suggested that commuters spend on average £10.59 per day on lunch, snacks and coffee. “So if you’re skipping lunch twice a week you’re going to be saving whatever that cost is.” Janet Robinson a 56-year-old social worker from York, started the diet at the end of January 2014 and went on to lose 2½ stone (16kg) within a matter of months, while her husband lost 4½ stone. She agrees that she saves money on fast days. “Today’s lunch was £11 (I ate out). But on a fast day, if I take fruit and yoghurt, I would only spend £1.” Robinson says she’s cut out expensive processed food from her diet and now cooks her food from scratch – making bigger meals so that she can reheat them the next day. Spencer says, unlike other high-protein based diets, you can do 5:2 on the cheap. She suggests making a batch of soup for the fasting days as research shows it is more satiating than eating food or drinking liquid. “Somehow there’s a trigger mechanism that makes you feel fuller for longer. It’s easy to make – you’re using up food you’ve already got in your fridge. A bowl of rooty soup, like carrots and parsnips, will come in at about 30p a bowl. And because you’re not having a big hunk of bread and butter on the side your costs are really limited,” Spencer says.",profile/juliet-stott,stott,juliet

Even if you overcome the first hurdle and generate a valuable idea or piece of research - how do you then sum it up in a way that will capture the interest of reviewers?  There’s no simple formula for getting published - editors’ expectations can vary both between and within subject areas. But there are some challenges that will confront all academic writers regardless of their discipline. How should you respond to reviewer feedback? Is there a correct way to structure a paper? And should you always bother revising and resubmitting? We asked journal editors from a range of backgrounds for their tips on getting published.  The writing stage 1) Focus on a story that progresses logically, rather than chronologically Take some time before even writing your paper to think about the logic of the presentation. When writing, focus on a story that progresses logically, rather than the chronological order of the experiments that you did. Deborah Sweet, editor of Cell Stem Cell and publishing director at Cell Press 2) Don’t try to write and edit at the same time Open a file on the PC and put in all your headings and sub-headings and then fill in under any of the headings where you have the ideas to do so. If you reach your daily target (mine is 500 words) put any other ideas down as bullet points and stop writing; then use those bullet points to make a start the next day. If you are writing and can’t think of the right word (eg for elephant) don’t worry - write (big animal long nose) and move on - come back later and get the correct term. Write don’t edit; otherwise you lose flow.Roger Watson, editor-in-chief, Journal of Advanced Nursing 3) Don’t bury your argument like a needle in a haystack If someone asked you on the bus to quickly explain your paper, could you do so in clear, everyday language? This clear argument should appear in your abstract and in the very first paragraph (even the first line) of your paper. Don’t make us hunt for your argument as for a needle in a haystack. If it is hidden on page seven that will just make us annoyed. Oh, and make sure your argument runs all the way through the different sections of the paper and ties together the theory and empirical material.Fiona Macaulay, editorial board, Journal of Latin American Studies 4) Ask a colleague to check your work  One of the problems that journal editors face is badly written papers. It might be that the writer’s first language isn’t English and they haven’t gone the extra mile to get it proofread. It can be very hard to work out what is going on in an article if the language and syntax are poor. Brian Lucey, editor, International Review of Financial Analysis 5) Get published by writing a review or a response  Writing reviews is a good way to get published - especially for people who are in the early stages of their career. It’s a chance to practice at writing a piece for publication, and get a free copy of a book that you want. We publish more reviews than papers so we’re constantly looking for reviewers. Some journals, including ours, publish replies to papers that have been published in the same journal. Editors quite like to publish replies to previous papers because it stimulates discussion.Yujin Nagasawa, co-editor and review editor of the European Journal for Philosophy of Religion, philosophy of religion editor of Philosophy Compass 6) Don’t forget about international readers We get people who write from America who assume everyone knows the American system - and the same happens with UK writers. Because we’re an international journal, we need writers to include that international context.Hugh McLaughlin, editor in chief, Social Work Education - the International Journal 7) Don’t try to cram your PhD into a 6,000 word paper Sometimes people want to throw everything in at once and hit too many objectives. We get people who try to tell us their whole PhD in 6,000 words and it just doesn’t work. More experienced writers will write two or three papers from one project, using a specific aspect of their research as a hook.Hugh McLaughlin, editor in chief, Social Work Education - the International Journal Submitting your work  8) Pick the right journal: it’s a bad sign if you don’t recognise any of the editorial board Check that your article is within the scope of the journal that you are submitting to. This seems so obvious but it’s surprising how many articles are submitted to journals that are completely inappropriate. It is a bad sign if you do not recognise the names of any members of the editorial board. Ideally look through a number of recent issues to ensure that it is publishing articles on the same topic and that are of similar quality and impact.Ian Russell, editorial director for science at Oxford University Press 9) Always follow the correct submissions procedures Often authors don’t spend the 10 minutes it takes to read the instructions to authors which wastes enormous quantities of time for both the author and the editor and stretches the process when it does not need toTangali Sudarshan, editor, Surface Engineering 10) Don’t repeat your abstract in the cover letterWe look to the cover letter for an indication from you about what you think is most interesting and significant about the paper, and why you think it is a good fit for the journal. There is no need to repeat the abstract or go through the content of the paper in detail – we will read the paper itself to find out what it says. The cover letter is a place for a bigger picture outline, plus any other information that you would like us to have.Deborah Sweet, editor of Cell Stem Cell and publishing director at Cell Press 11) A common reason for rejections is lack of context Make sure that it is clear where your research sits within the wider scholarly landscape, and which gaps in knowledge it’s addressing. A common reason for articles being rejected after peer review is this lack of context or lack of clarity about why the research is important.Jane Winters, executive editor of the Institute of Historical Research’s journal, Historical Research and associate editor of Frontiers in Digital Humanities: Digital History 12) Don’t over-state your methodology Ethnography seems to be the trendy method of the moment, so lots of articles submitted claim to be based on it. However, closer inspection reveals quite limited and standard interview data. A couple of interviews in a café do not constitute ethnography. Be clear - early on - about the nature and scope of your data collection. The same goes for the use of theory. If a theoretical insight is useful to your analysis, use it consistently throughout your argument and text. Fiona Macaulay, editorial board, Journal of Latin American Studies Dealing with feedback 13) Respond directly (and calmly) to reviewer comments When resubmitting a paper following revisions, include a detailed document summarising all the changes suggested by the reviewers, and how you have changed your manuscript in light of them. Stick to the facts, and don’t rant. Don’t respond to reviewer feedback as soon as you get it. Read it, think about it for several days, discuss it with others, and then draft a response.Helen Ball, editorial board, Journal of Human Lactation   14) Revise and resubmit: don’t give up after getting through all the major hurdles You’d be surprised how many authors who receive the standard “revise and resubmit” letter never actually do so. But it is worth doing - some authors who get asked to do major revisions persevere and end up getting their work published, yet others, who had far less to do, never resubmit. It seems silly to get through the major hurdles of writing the article, getting it past the editors and back from peer review only to then give up.Fiona Macaulay, editorial board, Journal of Latin American Studies 15) It is acceptable to challenge reviewers, with good justification It is acceptable to decline a reviewer’s suggestion to change a component of your article if you have a good justification, or can (politely) argue why the reviewer is wrong. A rational explanation will be accepted by editors, especially if it is clear you have considered all the feedback received and accepted some of it.Helen Ball, editorial board of Journal of Human Lactation 16) Think about how quickly you want to see your paper published Some journals rank more highly than others and so your risk of rejection is going to be greater. People need to think about whether or not they need to see their work published quickly - because certain journals will take longer. Some journals, like ours, also do advance access so once the article is accepted it appears on the journal website. This is important if you’re preparing for a job interview and need to show that you are publishable. Hugh McLaughlin, editor in chief, Social Work Education - the International Journal  17) Remember: when you read published papers you only see the finished article Publishing in top journals is a challenge for everyone, but it may seem easier for other people. When you read published papers you see the finished article, not the first draft, nor the first revise and resubmit, nor any of the intermediate versions – and you never see the failures.Philip Powell, managing editor of the Information Systems Journal Enter the Guardian university awards 2015 and join the higher education network for more comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

407,2015-01-03T07:00:11Z,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jan/03/inheritance-tax-row-with-mod,Pilot’s daughter stands to lose her home over row about father’s death,money,Money,The Guardian,"Was Lieutenant James Patrick killed during “warlike” service, or did his death occur during a “routine” training exercise? Almost 50 years after the jet he was flying exploded in mid-air, a Ministry of Defence ruling that seeks to answer this question once and for all has landed his daughter Serena with a cripplingly high inheritance tax bill that may force her to sell her flat. She and the MoD are at odds over the interpretation of a tax break that exempts the estates of members of the armed forces from inheritance tax provided certain conditions are met. The chancellor, George Osborne, recently announced he was extending this exemption to emergency services personnel and aid workers – but when it comes to the case of Patrick, a Royal Navy pilot who served aboard HMS Ark Royal, it seems the MoD won’t budge. His daughter, a part-time teacher, says this is not just about money. Serena feels the authorities have done her late father a disservice by failing to properly recognise the “incredibly dangerous job” he was doing at a tense time in Britain’s naval history. Back in 1966, Patrick was a pilot with the Fleet Air Arm and taking part in the so-called Beira Patrol off the coast of Mozambique. Virtually forgotten now but a big deal at the time, the Beira Patrol was a naval blockade intended to choke off oil supplies to Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), which had illegally declared independence from Britain just a few months earlier. On the afternoon of 22 March, three weeks after the blockade began, Patrick’s Sea Vixen jet took off from the deck of Ark Royal on a bombing exercise, to practise dropping 500lb high-explosive bombs on targets placed in the sea. But one of the bombs exploded prematurely, apparently because of a problem with a safety pin, instantly killing the 30-year-old and his observer. “All that was found were a few very small pieces of the aircraft and two flying helmets,” according to the letter of sympathy sent to Patrick’s wife Juanita. Serena, who turned 50 last month, has no memory of her father – she was 15 months old when he died, and only has one photo of him holding her. However, she found herself hit by a “wave of emotion and facts” when, following the death of her mother in February 2013, she was advised to find out if the inheritance tax exemption relating to members of the armed forces might apply to her mother, Juanita’s, estate. This exemption is granted when an individual dies while serving in the armed forces, provided they were either “on active service against an enemy” or “on other service of a warlike nature, or which, in the opinion of the Treasury, involved the same risks as service of a warlike nature”. In February 2013, Guardian Money featured the case of Robert Mendoza, whose family successfully claimed the exemption – resulting in an inheritance tax saving of more than £20,000 – after his death in 2012. Mendoza had developed a form of TB while serving on board a navy ship during the second world war, and his family succeeded in making the case that this was a contributory factor in his death 67 years later. Serena turned detective (and military researcher) and, after investigating the circumstances of her father’s death, applied to the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency (SPVA), the body that decided exemption requests. But it turned her down. In a letter, an SPVA official said Patrick would have been “routinely involved in bombing exercises”, adding that while Ark Royal had been taking part in the Beira Patrol, it was heading towards Singapore when the accident happened. The letter also said the Beira Patrol “was not categorised as war but as a blockade, and therefore the use of force was not authorised by the United Nations”. However, Serena says the accident happened at a time when the UN security council was known to be about to turn up the heat on Rhodesia; on 9 April 1966, just 18 days after her father’s death, a security council resolution was passed calling on Britain to use force if necessary to prevent oil shipments getting through. She adds that while the accident occurred during a gap in Ark Royal’s Beira Patrol duties, the aircraft carrier was continuing to take part in the operation, and the bombing exercise was “preparatory to deployment”. Serena says on top of that, the Sea Vixen was “well-known to be a dangerous aircraft”; her father was one of six Ark Royal Sea Vixen aircrew killed in just 19 months. And she points out that her father’s name is inscribed on the armed forces memorial near Lichfield, Staffordshire, which honours those “killed on duty while performing functions attributable to the special circumstances and requirements of the armed forces, or as a result of terrorist action, and those who died while deployed on designated operations”. The SPVA’s decision to turn down Serena’s request for an exemption has proved costly for her. Her mother’s estate was valued at £965,000 – well above the inheritance tax threshold of £325,000 – though they weren’t (and aren’t) a wealthy family. This is almost entirely down to the fact that her mother’s house, the estate’s most valuable asset, is located in Putney, south-west London. Juanita bought it for £6,000 in 1969, when Serena was four, but it was valued at probate at £800,000. As the only child, Serena has had to pay the full inheritance tax bill of £256,000, which has left her “seriously in debt”. If the exemption had been granted, this would have cut the bill to £126,000. “I’ll have to sell my little flat, as I just feel so strongly that I don’t want to sell the house. It was the house I lived in from the age of four, and is where I live now. Why should they take my house?” She has carried on battling. Her MP, Justine Greening, has raised her case with the MoD, but both the previous and current defence secretary, Philip Hammond and Michael Fallon, have said that because Patrick died on a “training exercise,” the exemption cannot apply. Serena says: “It seems to have been written off as a training exercise. I just don’t see how what he did had fewer risks, given the context. To me, this feels morally wrong.” As to what happens now, she says: “I don’t know what else I can do – a judicial review? “It’s money I don’t have. I’m immensely proud of my father, and this really feels like a lack of recognition for his utter commitment to the defence of this country, and his bravery.”",profile/rupertjones,Rupert,Jones

Photograph: Luis Fidel Ayerves/Getty Images   Málaga’s credentials as a cultural city-break destination will get a serious boost this spring, when the Pompidou Centre opens its first outpost outside Paris there. The Cube – a striking €5m glass building on the revamped marina – will house a permanent modern art collection and run a programme of arts events from dance to video. The birthplace of Pablo Picasso is also set to be home to a branch of the St Petersburg State Russian Museum, showcasing art from the 15th to the 20th centuries. The Museum of Fine Arts and Archaeology, opening later in the year, will complete the triple whammy of new attractions. Besides museums, Málaga has plenty for the foodie traveller, plus cheap flights, great shopping and nightlife, and access to some of the Costa’s best beaches – a winning weekend break combo. The Soho Boutique hotel opened last year in the arty Soho barrio, south of the old town, with doubles from €63 room-only. Kanazawa, Japan  Kanazawa was one of the few Japanese cities to escape major destruction during the second world war. As a result, it is able to show off its heritage and traditional culture: from the Nagamachi quarter with its samurai residencies to the teahouses of Higashi Chayagai – a district with the only geisha community outside Kyoto. In March, a new high-speed train line will make the city more accessible than ever, cutting the journey time from Tokyo to Kanazawa from four hours to two-and-a-half. Inside Japan Tours offers a 14-night Traditional Japan self-guided trip from £1,360pp (based on two sharing) including 14 nights’ B&B accommodation, some meals, and all domestic transport (excludes international flights).      Photograph: JTB Photo/UIG via Getty Images   Yosemite, California    The view from Glacier Point down Yosemite Valley. Photograph: Alamy   “It is by far the grandest of all the special temples of Nature I was ever permitted to enter.” So said John Muir, the Scottish-born conservationist whose passionate and influential writing helped persuade Congress to pass a bill leading to the declaration of Yosemite as the US’s third national park, in 1890. This made the protection of 1,200 square miles of deep valleys, wild-flower meadows, giant sequoias and waterfalls a legal obligation. More than a century later, Yosemite is still one of the crown jewels of the American national parks system. Visit in summer for hiking, rafting, fishing and rock climbing; in winter, some roads and trails are closed but there is the chance to enjoy the quiet splendour of the landscape without the crowds. Several events are planned to mark the 125th anniversary on 1 October, including tours led by an actor portraying Galen Clark, who explored the park many times with Muir and was instrumental in its gaining protected status. If you are planning to stay overnight, check out yosemitepark.com/lodging for accommodation: it lists options from permanent camps in the High Sierra to the hotel of choice for visiting dignitaries, the luxury Ahwahnee. For a longer trip, Yosemite Valley is also the start of the magnificent John Muir Trail, which passes through 211 miles of spectacular scenery in the Sierra Nevada mountains. It makes up part of the Pacific Crest Trail, a 2,650-mile path running from Mexico to Canada that is about to get its moment in the Hollywood limelight with the release, on 16 January in the UK, of Wild, based on a true story, in which Reese Witherspoon plays Cheryl Strayed, a troubled woman grieving after her mother’s death, who hikes 1,100 miles of the trail alone. Despite gory close-ups of blisters, the film is likely to inspire countless journeys into the wilderness. Over in Colorado, the Rocky Mountains national park is celebrating its centenary this year, with events from exhibitions and talks to free guided hikes. Haiti      Photograph: John Seaton Callahan/Getty Images/Flickr Open   One for the adventurous traveller, Haiti is set to welcome more visitors in 2015 with several operators, from Wild Frontiers to G Adventures and Exodus, running trips for the first time. Five years on from the devastating earthquake, the country claims it is ready for tourism, offering an authentic Caribbean experience with a vibrant arts scene, the largest fortress in the Americas and distinctive Creole culture among the highlights. A 10-day trip with G Adventures costs from £1,599, excluding flights. Cuba      Photograph: Walter Bibikow/JAI/Corbis   Last month, President Obama announced that America would be re-establishing diplomatic relations with Cuba – meaning change is sure to follow, so head to Cuba sooner rather than later to enjoy its unique old-school charms. With the government slowly allowing the development of non-state-owned tourism, there’s been a growth in private enterprise recently – particularly seen in Old Havana, a thriving cultural hub, with new bars like O’Reilly 304, and recently opened stylish B&B Casa Alta (£19-25 a night) adding to the buzz. To mark the 500th anniversary of the founding of the southern city of Santiago de Cuba on 25 July, a week of partying and a carnival has been planned. World Expeditions has a new 12-day cycling tour, exploring the country’s lesser-known spots, from £1,567pp. And Che Guevara’s son, Ernesto junior, has just launched six- and nine-day motorbike tours of the island – and leads some tours himself (from £1,999, lapoderosatours.com).  Essaouira, Morocco    Ramparts of Skala de la Ville, Essaouira. Photograph: Nikki Bidgood/Getty Images   Essaouira has always felt a little exclusive. Not because it’s expensive (it isn’t) or super-smart (it’s extremely laid-back) but because, until now, it’s been a massive hassle to get there. British travellers have had to fly to Marrakech or Agadir, before taking a two-and-a-half-hour taxi transfer. Now, with easyJet launching direct flights from Luton in May, this atmospheric Atlantic port is set to be transformed into one of Morocco’s hottest destinations. The souks are relatively hassle-free, the restaurants have fabulous views of the crashing waves and the beaches are huge. Stay in the centre of town at Dar Adul (doubles from £43 B&B), or in the countryside 15 minutes outside at the tranquil Les Jardin des Douars (doubles from £79 B&B). Nicaragua    Concepcion volcano and Ometepe island, Nicaragua. Photograph: Alamy   Though it’s been peaceful for 25 years, the largest Central American country remains one of the least-visited. It’s a land of rainforests (Indio Maíz biological reserve is the largest area of virgin rainforest north of the Amazon), lakes and volcanoes, with deserted beaches, unspoilt colonial cities and incredible wildlife. Things look set to change, though, as the country opens up – an airport opened recently on Ometepe island, a Unesco biosphere reserve known for its twin volcanoes. A bridge is being built over the San Juan river, connecting Nicaragua with Costa Rica and, most controversially, work has started on an inter-oceanic canal to rival Panama’s, cutting through Lake Nicaragua on a 173-mile journey between the Caribbean and the Pacific. There’s been a boom in luxury hotel openings, one of the latest being Mukul on the Emerald Coast. Journey Latin America has a one-off group tour in May visiting Ometepe island and the Solentiname islands in Lake Nicaragua plus a cruise on the San Juan river. The 17-day trip costs £2,098pp, excluding international flights. Dorset, UK ▼    Seaside Boarding House, Dorset Photograph: PR   If hit TV drama Broadchurch, which starts a second series tomorrow, hasn’t put Dorset on the map, the release of Thomas Vinterberg’s film of Far From the Madding Crowd in May should have people flocking to this rolling landscape in, well, madding crowds. A new trail map, Exploring Thomas Hardy’s West Dorset (the novelist used the ancient name Wessex for his “partly real, partly dream county”) will link places that inspired him, including his birthplace at Higher Bockhampton. Those looking for a modern billet should be able to bed down at the eagerly anticipated Seaside Boarding House , whose opening was delayed from last year. On cliffs near Lyme Bay, it is the latest venture by Mary Lou-Sturridge and Tony Mackintosh, who founded the Groucho Club in London’s Soho in 1985. Memphis, Tennessee    Fans at Elvis’s grave, Graceland Photograph: Lucas Jackson /Reuters   Memphis, Tennessee, is one of the world’s great music cities and in 2015, there’ll be even more reasons for fans of rock’n’roll, blues and soul to tune in to what’s happening. For starters, 8 January marks 80 years since the birth of the city’s most famous resident, Elvis Presley. Graceland, his home and now iconic museum, has a range of celebrations planned from 7-10 January, including an auction of memorabilia, a double-bill screening of Viva Las Vegas and Jailhouse Rock, a ceremony declaring the eighth as Elvis Presley Day, and a tribute concert. These will take place at Graceland and other venues around the city. Other highlights this year include the opening of two new music museums. The Blues Music Hall of Fame is set to open in May at 421 South Main Street, while the Memphis Music Hall of Fame will be at 126 Beale Street, in a building shared with rock-star outfitter of choice Lansky Bros. Marseille and Lyon     Musée des Confluences, Lyon. Photograph: Robert Pratta/Reuters   The two contenders for the hotly disputed title of France’s second city will be drawn closer together and be more accessible from May, when Eurostar’s new, year-round direct service will link London with Marseille via Lyon and Avignon. Marseille enjoyed the limelight when it was crowned European Capital of Culture 2013 – cue the largest urban renewal project in southern Europe with a budget of €7bn, including a facelift for the Vieux-Port. But the Mediterranean city will really start to see the fruits of its transformation as a major tourist destination when Eurostar starts running its 6.5-hour direct trains to Saint-Charles station on 1 May. New openings over the last year include the recently completed Les Voûtes de la Major precinct of boutiques and restaurants near the cathedral and les Halles de La Major market, underneath Cathédrale de la Major, dedicated to gourmet foods. C2 Hotel features Modernist furniture by Le Corbusier and Frank Lloyd Wright (doubles from €189); and critics have given rave reviews to the tiny, 22-cover AM restaurant, owned by chef Alexandre Mazzia, which opened in June. Not new, but more reflective of the city’s diversity is La Friche Belle de Mai, a former factory converted into studios, exhibition spaces, theatres and cinemas, which often promotes the city’s rap and hip-hop heritage. The bistros and bouchons of Lyon, the self-proclaimed French capital of gastronomy, will be just over 4.5 hours away, come May. But there’s more to the city than food – a similarly ambitious plan to renovate its former dock area on the banks of the Rhône and the Saône rivers kicked off in 2007. The latest addition to the Confluence district – with its trendy restaurants, contemporary art galleries and designer boutiques – is the Musée des Confluences, which opened in December. Conceptualised as “the Crystal and the Cloud” by its architects, because of its futuristic glass and stainless-steel construction, it stands on the headland at the confluence of the rivers and showcases the sciences and anthropology. Also in the Confluence district, La Sucrière is a new venue for the arts and music which opened last summer in a renovated sugar warehouse. It is the principal site for the Biennale of Contemporary Art (10 September-3 January 2016) and one of the venues for the annual electronic music festival Nuits-Sonores (13-17 May). Madhya Pradesh, India    A tiger in Bandhavgarh national park, Madhya Pradesh.  Photograph: Getty Images   A new film adaptation of the adventures of Mowgli in Rudyard Kipling’s Jungle Book will hit the big screen later this year, with a stellar cast including Scarlett Johansson, Bill Murray. It also happens to be 150 years since Kipling’s birth. For those inspired to seek an Indian jungle experience, Village Ways has a new trip to the central state of Madhya Pradesh, staying in village-owned accommodation in the forest community at Sakata, with wildlife walks and safaris into the Pench tiger reserve. A five-night trip costs from £561pp full-board, including internal flights and transfers. Costa Rica       Photograph: Alamy   It’s tiny, and well-known for its amazing flora and fauna – more than half of the country is covered in lush forest and there are more than 60 national parks and reserves. Then there are the beaches along its two coasts, which rival any in the Caribbean. Getting there is going to be easier from November, when Thomson Airways launches the first direct flights from the UK, flying to the northern city of Liberia from Gatwick (the usual, longer, route is via Miami or Madrid). A week at the beachfront Tamarindo Diria resort costs from £949pp B&B, including flights and transfers (thomson.co.uk). Salisbury    Salisbury Cathedral. Photograph: Alamy   The unassuming city of Salisbury will draw history lovers this year as it takes a central role in celebrations for the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta. There are just four original copies of the cornerstone for English law and first document to champion the rights and freedom of the common people – and the best preserved is in Salisbury Cathedral. Events include a week-long flower festival in September. Lincoln, too, will play a key part in the celebrations – the £22m Lincoln Castle Revealed project opens in April, with a new vault to display its own copy of the Magna Carta. Across the country, a series of trails have been developed visiting places with Magna Carta links , and the British Library in London will be staging a major exhibition from 13 March to 1 September. Tatra mountains, Slovakia    Ski touring in the High Tatras. Photograph: Alamy   For skiers seeking new terrain, the Tatra (or Tatry) mountains offer an easy getaway, thanks to recently launched direct flights with Wizz Air from Luton to Poprad-Tatry (four times a week, from €20 one-way). Skiers and snowboarders of all levels are catered for in Jasná, the best-known resort in the Low Tatras, and Tatranská Lomnica, Starý Smokovec and Strbské Pleso in the neighbouring High Tatras. More than €200m has been invested to improve infrastructure – and the Freeride World Tour and World Snowboard Tour will make stops in the Tatras this winter. There are also three new aquaparks, which are open all year. Mountain Paradise offers Thurs-Sun weekend packages at the Vila Park & Pension Paula from £499pp including flights (8 Jan-22 Mar 2015). Cáceres, Spain    Prawn with seaweed bread at Atrio in Cáceres. Photograph: Alamy   Move over Spanish foodie favourite San Sebastián. Gourmets in search of new delights will be heading to Cáceres, in Extremadura, western Spain, which has been named the country’s 2015 Capital of Gastronomy. The Unesco world heritage city centre is a picturesque maze of narrow, cobbled medieval streets and this year’s programme of food-focused events and festivals will shine the spotlight on this often-overlooked gem. Expect to try local specialities such as jamón ibérico, bread soup with paprika, rice with rabbit, and torta del casar, the subtly bitter local cheese made from raw sheep’s milk. Toño Pérez and José Polo are the guiding lights at Atrio, a forward-looking restaurant-with-rooms (from €250pn) in the city centre that is universally recognised as Extremadura’s best. Its wine list is also one of the best (and the longest) in Spain. Cáceres’ cheaper Parador hotel, housed in a 14th-century palace on a street at the top of the old town, emerged from a modernising refurb in 2013 as one of the finest in the luxury, state-owned chain. Spacious doubles cost from €95 a night without breakfast. Bristol    Ashton Court bike trail, Bristol. Photograph: Alamy   Bristol has always had a proud, left-field edge to it; it’s the kind of place that lets its main road be transformed into a giant waterslide – as artist Luke Jerram did, to the public’s delight, last spring. So, it should be no surprise that Bristol has become the first UK city ever to win the European Green Capital award, in recognition of its “progressive, creative and conscious approach to urban living”. This will manifest itself in a year-long programme of events and activities, including the launch of the world’s first solar-powered hot-air balloon, a 30m walk-in blue whale sculpture – to be made by locals from recycled materials – and a cultural festival that will invite writers, artists, filmmakers, poets and architects to take part. February also sees the return of Bristol’s biennial In Between Time festival, which produces dramatic urban interventions around the city, including a 10-day installation during which Peros’ Bridge in Bristol Harbourside will “disappear” behind a veil of fog – a creative celebration of the city’s new Green Capital status. One of the greenest places to stay in the city is the aptly named The Greenhouse in Southville (doubles from £105 B&B). For more information visit bristol2015.co.uk and ibt15.co.uk. Leipzig, Germany    The Spinnerei artists’ enclave, Leipzig. Photograph: Alamy   The hype around Leipzig continues apace, with its flourishing arts scene earning it the “new Berlin” tag. In 2015, the city is celebrating 1,000 years since it was founded, with events running all year. Among the highlights is a week-long festival from 31 May, with street theatre and music events, followed by the Bachfest from 12-21 June and open-air concerts by the Gewandhaus Orchestra on 10-11 July. Fans of Paul Klee can catch a retrospective at the Leipzig Museum of Fine Arts (1 March-25 May). The Spinnerei, a former cotton mill that now houses an enclave of artist’s studios, celebrates a 10-year anniversary with open days in January, May and September. Stay at Meisterzimmer, which offers self-catering rooms surrounded by artists’ studios, from €75 a night. Rugby World Cup in England and Wales      Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images   Oggy, oggy, oggy! In case you hadn’t heard – the Rugby World Cup is coming to England (and Wales) later this year. The tournament lasts six weeks (18 September-31 October) and the 10 host cities include Newcastle, Cardiff, Exeter and Brighton. The opening ceremony takes place at Twickenham, west London, on 18 September ahead of England’s first game against Fiji. But Newcastle – where New Zealand’s All Blacks will be defending their title in the group stages against Tonga on 9 October (overnight package plus match ticket and match-day transfers from £299pp with englandrugbytravel.com) – has really got into the spirit. There will be a large fan zone near St James’ Park, offering music, food, drinks and, of course, all the action on big screens. Pilsen, Czech Republic      Photograph: Alamy   Pilsen is known for beer, which has been brewed in the city since 1295, and a tour of the Pilsner Urquell brewery is great fun. There are also several microbreweries and a beer spa. Beyond beer, Pilsen is one of two 2015 European Capitals of Culture (along with Mons; see page 9), has a charming centre, and is seeing its rundown industrial areas revitalised, with artworks popping up in unlikely spaces. An artist-in-residence will transform an abandoned public bathhouse, and a former brewery-cum-barracks, Svetovar, is being turned into a major cultural centre. The Hidden City project, a free app, takes you on unusual sightseeing tours devised by locals including a student, an immigrant and a second world war veteran. Exciting events run throughout the year: circus, theatre and light festivals; live music in baroque buildings; and exhibitions of art, architecture and puppetry. But back to beer: the four-star Hotel Rous (doubles from €75), in a grand old house in the centre, brews its own. Faroe Islands      Photograph: Visit Faroe Islands     A tiny 18-island archipelago roughly halfway between Iceland and Scotland, with nearly twice as many sheep as people, the Faroe Islands have a romantic appeal for travellers looking for a remote, back-to-nature experience. In March, the islands will be one of only two places in the world to see the total solar eclipse (the Norwegian islands of Svalbard being the other). It’s a great reason to visit the Faroes – a magical world of waterfalls and fjords and huge bird colonies. There’s a vibrant cultural scene, too – festivals and boat races in traditional Faroese boats fill the summer months – but among the most intimate and left-field is Hoyma, a new music festival held each November, which takes place in locals’ sitting rooms. Most hotels are booked now for the eclipse, but there are still B&B and camping options: see solareclipse.fo. Flights are via Copenhagen or Oslo with Atlantic Airways.

This year, he will debut his latest project, Museo Atlántico, off the coast of Lanzarote – Europe’s first underwater museum. The first phase will open in September and, when complete, will comprise 10 separate large-scale installations and more than 300 individual sculptures, designed to create a marine habitat for endemic species, in a sheltered bay near Playa Blanca. Visitors will be able to swim and snorkel among the sculptures or view them from a glass-bottomed boat or a submarine – a magical experience. Elsewhere in the Canaries, Tenerife hopes to attract visitors to its natural volcanic beauty with a new walking festival from 10-14 March. Greece’s lesser-known Cyclades    Church on Milos, Greece. Photograph: Gerhard Zwerger-Schoner/Corbis   New flights to the islands of Santorini and Mykonos saw visitor numbers soar last summer. This year, other central Aegean islands are likely to see the knock-on effect. Tiny, rugged Folegandros, chic Sifnos and unspoilt Milos are three islands that look set to be the subject of more attention. On the mainland, Athens continues to rise from economic downturn, with a busy start-up scene, great new restaurants and the Acropolis Museum celebrating its sixth birthday in June. Sunvil Holidays has a 10-night island-hopping trip to the lesser-known Cyclades from £850pp with flights and B&B.  Porto      Photograph: Alamy   We do love Lisbon, but Porto, Portugal’s second city, is going to be luring more visitors in 2015 as easyJet launches direct flights from Bristol, Luton and Manchester in April. Set on the banks of the Douro in the north of the country, Porto’s historic centre has been Unesco-listed since 1996 and is a picturesque mish-mash of medieval churches, cobbled lanes, pretty squares, steep steps and beautiful buildings tumbling down to the river. The birthplace of port, it’s a must for wine lovers, and recent years have witnessed something of a cultural renaissance with galleries, restaurants and boutiques opening – the city rebranded itself last year to convey its “youthful, cosmopolitan” side. The newly opened World of Discoveries museum and theme park is worth checking out – visitors can trace the journeys of past Portuguese explorers, with boat rides recreating their epic voyages to South America, Africa and Asia. Among new accommodation options is the 1872 River House, a cute eight-bedroom B&B in the historic Ribeira district (doubles from £126, breakfast served until 1pm, book on i-escape.com). Rodez, France      Photograph: Christian Richters/Corbis   The Musée Soulages opened in Rodez in May 2014. After two months, 100,000 people had visited. Suddenly this out-of-the-way town in south-central France was on the cultural map. Pierre Soulages is France’s most famous abstract artist, a sort of Gallic Mark Rothko, with the emphasis on black. The spectacular, modern cuboid steel building is home to 500 of his works gifted by the artist to his home town. A bonus for the visitor is that local award-winning chefs Sebastien and Michel Bras have opened a cafe/brasserie within the museum. Places to stay include La Ferme de Bourran, a converted 19th-century mansion with seven well-equipped, modern rooms from €89 to €200. Ryanair flies to Rodez from Stansted and Dublin. Margate     Dreamland amusement park. Photograph: Nicholas Bailey/Rex Features   When the Turner Contemporary opened in 2011, it kick-started interest in this down-at-heel Thanet town. Visitors were drawn to the harbour-wall gallery and then across the road to the cafes and antique shops of the rebranded “Old Town”, where new ventures such as Haeckels sell beauty products made from local materials. The release of Mike Leigh’s Mr Turner last year helped maintain momentum and this year’s reopening of the Dreamland amusement park – the first phase is scheduled for March despite storm damage last month – with its grade II-listed roller coaster, will boost interest further. Namibia      Photograph: Frans Lanting/Corbis   Much of the long-awaited fourth Mad Max film, which will hit the silver screen later this year, was filmed not in Australia, but in the dramatic Namib desert in Namibia – and its starring role should win the country new fans. March will see the 25th anniversary of independence from South Africa, with widespread celebrations planned. Namibia is something of a pioneer in conservation and, unlike many areas of Africa, has seen wildlife populations increase. With the South African Rand (to which the Namibian dollar is pegged) weak against the pound, it’s better value than many African destinations. Expert Africa offers a two-week, self-drive safari from £2,439pp, including flights from Heathrow, accommodation, car hire and some meals. Utrecht, Netherlands      Photograph: Maria Swärd/Getty Images/Flickr RF   As with many Dutch cities, Utrecht lives in Amsterdam’s shadow. But, having secured this year’s Grand Depart of the Tour de France – in part as an acknowledgement of its cycle-friendly outlook – the city is preparing for its day in the sun. Its appeal as a weekend break destination seems remarkably undersold. It has a historic, canal-lined centre, reminiscent of Bruges, plenty of modish cafes and restaurants, and an unpretentious urban intellectual vibe, the result of having the largest university in the Netherlands at its heart. To stay, try the Mother Goose Hotel, which opened in July and has stylish rooms from €105. Zermatt       Photograph: Patrick Frilet/Rex Features   The Swiss ski resort of Zermatt gets even more attention than usual as it celebrates the 150th anniversary of the first ascent of the Matterhorn. An open-air play about Edward Whymper’s ascent will join the dozens of regular events, such as music festival Zermatt Unplugged in April. Most exciting for gnarly types is the reopening of the Hörnlihütte (pictured), at the Matterhorn’s basecamp, in July. The improved hut (it dates from 1880 and has been closed since last summer) will have proper drains and heating, and be connected to the 100-year-old Matterhorn mountain lodge, whose later extensions will be demolished. Normandy coast     Trouville-sur-Mer, Normandy. Photograph: Alamy   It’s not exactly difficult to reach the Normandy coast from the UK, but for those who can’t be bothered with the ferry and the drive, a new Ryanair flight (from £38 return) could be an incentive to go this spring or summer. The Stansted-Deauville flights will run from 3 April until 23 October on Fridays and Mondays, making a long weekend in the chic seaside town that inspired so many artists very doable. Colourful beach umbrellas and beach cabins for hire are dotted along the 2km-long beach, and there are a number of photography and film festivals running through the year. Nearby Trouville-sur-Mer, across the Touques river, has sandy beaches and belle époque architecture, and Honfleur, a 30-minute drive east, is an attractive fishing port depicted by several impressionist painters, some of whose works are in the Eugène Boudin museum, in a former 19th-century chapel. Croatia      Photograph: Alamy   Game of Thrones has done a lot to boost tourism to Croatia – and it will do so again in 2015, when season five hits our screens, with medieval Dubrovnik once again starring as King’s Landing. The country’s reputation as Europe’s festival capital grows ever stronger – Croatia Rocks will be the new kid on the block next summer, brought to partygoers by the Ibiza Rocks Group. It will be held on Zrce beach on Pag island (the same location as the Hideout festival), and tickets cost from £99. New flights for next year make access even easier, too – BA will fly to Split from Heathrow and easyJet from Belfast, both from May, for the summer season, and European Coastal Airlines has new flights to Hvar and other islands. With the kuna more than 5% weaker than a year ago, it offers good value for UK holidaymakers, too. Palm Springs, California      Photograph: Kenneth Johansson/Kenneth Johansson/Corbis   A great place to immerse yourself in Golden-era Hollywood glamour, Palm Springs is home to the world’s best-preserved collection of modernist architecture. The showcase event for the city’s iconic design is Modernism Week, which celebrates its 10th anniversary year (12-22 February), with a host of walking tours of iconic houses and neighbourhoods. But you don’t have to be in town for that week to soak up the atmosphere and style of the era. Whenever you visit, book into a classic modernist hotel, such as the Horizon, or the Ace, for a contemporary take on design. Spring sees the opening of the 32-room Arrive hotel in the north end of the Design District. Paying homage to the local architectural heritage, it is aiming to become a social hub for locals as well as visitors. For more insight into the city’s architecture, join the excellent Palm Springs Modern Tours, which offer expert guided visits to some of the 20th-century treasures, including Frank Sinatra’s first Palm Springs home. Ol’ Blue Eyes would have been 100 in 2015, so it’s perfect timing. Northern Sri Lanka    A beach at Nilaveli, north of Trincomalee. Photograph: Alamy   Sri Lanka has golden beaches and swaying coconut palms in abundance, but some of the island’s most beautiful stretches of coast were off-limits for decades, lying as they did in territory controlled by the Tamil Tigers. Now, five years after the civil war ended, new luxury resorts such as those run by Uga Escapes, are springing up on lush and largely empty shores around the port of Trincomalee. But for truly untrodden Sri Lanka, foreign visitors should apply to the country’s ministry of defence for permission (it seems to be a formality) to head north up the now repaired and demined A9 – once called the Highway of Blood. (Or enjoy a truly novel experience by taking the train that started running from Colombo to Jaffna this autumn – £7.50 one way in an air-conditioned carriage.) This northern city is now rebuilding its few hotels and opening its doors to the world. Stay in the centre of town, close to restaurants on Stanley Road (the Cosy and the Nila are both good, and astonishing value), at the Subhas Hotel (doubles from £20 B&B). Only one wing has been rebuilt so far, but the welcome is friendly, and they’ll bring a delicious breakfast of roti or dosas, with spicy sambol, tropical fruits and tea, to your room. For somewhere less edgy, particularly if you’re a female traveller hoping for a hassle-free beer by the pool, try the Green Grass (doubles from £27 B&B). It’s a walk or short tuk-tuk ride to the fort, and dinners are excellent. Hotels – and indeed, tourists – are even rarer in the sunny, sleepy islands beyond Jaffna, reached by causeway and free ferry, but the intrepid traveller will find a ready welcome from people cut off from the west for a generation. Patagonia, Chile      Photograph: Bridget Besaw/Aurora Photos/Corbis   The 40th anniversary of Bruce Chatwin’s first visit to Patagonia and Top Gear’s recent controversial trip there have drawn attention to this stunning part of the world. Towards the end of 2015, a new national park is due to open in the Aysén region’s Chacabuco Valley – promising to protect an ecologically important corridor through the Andes between Chile and Argentina. Founded by conservationists Kris and Doug Tompkins (of North Face and Patagonia clothing company fame), it’s the fruit of a long struggle to turn a huge estancia back to its natural state. Pura Aventura has an 11-day trip to Parque Patagonia and Mallin Colorado from £2,552pp, including internal flights from the Chilean capital Santiago, but not international ones. Mons, Belgium       Photograph: Alamy   Mons, a hilltop city and a place of pilgrimage since the seventh century, is the joint 2015 European Capital of Culture (with Pilsen in the Czech Republic, see above). It is planning lots of innovative urban art; at the opening ceremony on 24 January, 18,000 free silver ponchos will be given out to create live, glittering mirror balls. There’s a major Van Gogh exhibition at BAM (25 Jan-17 May) and a maze of 8,000 sunflowers will bloom in the main square in July. Installations will appear on street corners: giant books cascading from a window; a huge red ball squeezed between buildings; and an enormous aquarium. New openings include a whopping five new museums, two concert halls (one with a meditation chapel, in a nod to Mons’s religious past) and a literary open-air cafe. There is also a focus on food, with barbecues, festivals, banquets and mystery dinners. Stay at the four-star Dream hotel, a converted neogothic convent with modern design and original features (doubles from €90). More at mons2015.eu. The Azores       Photograph: Ian Gethings/Getty Images/Moment Open   Scattered across the Atlantic Ocean almost 900 miles off the coast of Portugal, the nine volcanic islands of the Azores are a remote haven boasting amazing wildlife (whale-watching’s among the best in the world) and lush, unspoilt landscapes fringed by dramatic black sand beaches. For the past 10 years there has been a weekly direct flight from Gatwick to the main island of São Miguel with SATA. This year Ryanair becomes the first budget airline to fly to the islands, with weekly flights from Stansted to São Miguel in April, from £78 return. The other islands can then be reached by ferries and local flights. A great choice for walkers, divers and wildlife enthusiasts – and anyone who really wants to get away from it all (next stop is Canada, another 1,600 miles west). Milan    Mini cannelloni in a shop in Milan. Photograph: Alamy   A hub of fashion, design, finance and industry, Milan has always been a city with big ideas. That seems set to continue with the metropolis hosting the next world fair, Expo Milano 2015 (online tickets from €27). Over a six-month period, the expo will address the issue of feeding the planet, food security and biodiversity in events across a site laid out like a classical Roman city. Milan is also hosting Italy’s largest ever exhibition dedicated to Leonardo da Vinci. Held at the Royal Palace, it will include some of his most important paintings – such as the Dreyfus Madonna – and an impressive selection of drawings. Just as da Vinci was known for bringing together science and the arts, this year Milan will be a key place for anyone interested in life, the universe and everything. For somewhere to stay, try LaGare Hotel, a slick new pad with a roof garden, opening in February, with doubles from £120. The Channel Islands    View from a German bunker on Alderney, Channel Islands. Photograph: Alamy   While 2014 saw commemorations for the centenary of the first world war, this year marks the 70th anniversary of the end of the second. This will have particular resonance in the Channel Islands, the only part of the British Isles to be occupied during the war. To celebrate, the islands are collaborating to hold a five-week Heritage Festival, from 3 April-11 May, which will remind visitors of what life was like under German rule. Some sites, such as tunnels and bunkers dug into the islands, will be open to the public for the first time, and there will be guided walks, bike rides and tours, including a kayak tour following the routes spies used to travel between the islands. The Liberation day carnival on May 9 includes a concert and firework display on Guernsey’s picturesque St Peter Port seafront. The Farmhouse Hotel has 14 rooms in a restored 15th century farmhouse from £75 a night. New Zealand    Skyline Rotorua MTB Gravity Park, New Zealand. Photograph: Skyline Rotorua MTB Gravity Park/PR   Whether you visit the country’s North or South Island, attention is going to be lavished on NZ in 2015 – and it won’t all be Hobbit-related. Wellington will celebrate 150 years as a capital city with a week of festivities planned for July, and is to provide one of the venues (along with Auckland, Christchurch, Dunedin, Hamilton, Napier and Nelson) for the ICC Cricket World Cup, which New Zealand is co-hosting  with Australia from 14 February to 29 March. And the country’s great-outdoors appeal is sure to get an added push from having the world’s first year-round gondola-accessed mountain bike park. The Skyline Rotorua Mountain Bike Gravity Park opened last year and will be the first southern hemisphere venue for the Crankworx mountain biking festival, running from 25-29 March. Brisbane, Australia    Tryp Hotel, Fortitude Valley, Brisbane Photograph: PR   Once an overgrown country town, the Queensland capital has changed beyond recognition in recent years: Lonely Planet named it Australia’s hippest city last year. Alongside hotel and bar openings and the rise of riverside restaurants such as Pony Dining (which, in an act of gastronomic symbolism, replaced a McDonald’s at Eagle Street pier) and Stokehouse Q at Southbank, Brisvegas has a series of happening villages. Prime among them is Fortitude Valley, where the world’s first Tryp Hotel opened recently, as did Kwan Bros, a superb Japanese-fusion restaurant. Also on the north bank of the Brisbane river, once-seedy Caxton Street, near Paddington, is a new social hub, now home to the flamboyant Gambaro hotel and to Lefty’s Oldtime Music Hall, which has live bands, 100 rye whiskies, and was named Gourmet Traveller’s “best Australian bar 2014”. • This article was amended on 6 January 2015. Ryanair is not the first airline to fly direct to the Azores. Portuguese airline SATA already operate direct flights. ",,,

It’s an expensive mirage,money,Money,The Guardian,"We are entering a golden era of pension freedom this year, if you believe the government. But before doffing our caps to George Osborne for releasing us from the annuity jail, let’s explore some of the myths already building up. You’ll get free advice Watch Osborne’s lips in the 19 March 2014 budget. He said that everyone will be offered “free, impartial, face-to-face advice on how to get the most from the choices they will now have”. But you won’t. Straight after the speech, Osborne’s officials began backtracking on the promise. For the 400,000 people retiring each year, it won’t be advice (oh no, that would make the government liable for it) but “guidance”. The guidance won’t actually tell you what products to buy with your pension savings. It won’t be personally relevant, but at best will “signpost” people to where they can find real, regulated financial advice – which will cost hundreds, if not thousands of pounds. As industry expert Ned Cazalet points out, the current regulatory regime means “there is a strong danger that we end up with a two-tier nation, where the majority of retirees are effectively denied access to useful professional advice”. Annuities should continue to provide a “safety net” income for essentials The pensions industry, staring at the catastrophic collapse of £12bn a year in sales, is madly promoting the idea that annuities still have a role to play. They say you should still buy an annuity to guarantee you can afford the everyday spending essentials for the remaining years of your life, then use drawdown for other expenditure. But as Cazalet’s report reveals, annuities are even more God-awful than we thought. Even though he prepared it for a pension company, Royal London, Cazalet estimates that the industry has robbed 20% from your fund for expenses. Effectively, for every £50,000 you saved over your lifetime, they have been pocketing £10,000. Of course, Cazalet doesn’t use the word “rob”, but you see the point. Neither does he have much time for the idea that annuities leave you in profit so long as you last into your mid-80s. He reckons that flat-rate annuities (which don’t go up in line with inflation) do not pay you back the money you paid in until you reach the age of 85, which is a woeful two years above current male life expectancy at age 65. Index-linked annuities make no sense at all. On his maths, they only deliver value for money if the annuitant lives to be at least 101! You are going to live a very long time, so spread the money carefully It’s true, we are all living longer, men in particular. In 1971, a man aged 70 on average lived a further 9.5 years. Today, they are likely to live another 14.6 years. But how many of those additional years are spent in good health? The data suggests the first 10 years after 65 are spent in relatively good health, but after age 75 the average male will spend eight years in relatively poor health. What does this mean for pension planning? Blow it all before 75? Or keep it all back until 75 to spend on care needs? And if we are all supposed to be merrily drawing down our pension money, will we have the cognitive capacity to handle drawdown from our mid-80s onwards? The number of people suffering with dementia is expected to rise to 2 million by 2051. Oddly enough, Cazalet suggests that it may make sense to buy an annuity at age 75, notwithstanding their generally poor value, just to stop the elderly having to make financial decisions in later life. You will be able to use your pension like a bank account. Ha ha. Does anyone really think pension companies (and employers too) are in shape to deliver the new pension freedoms from 6 April? Get ready not for Pension Freedom Day but for Pension Total Chaos Day …",profile/patrickcollinson,Patrick ,Collinson
410,2015-01-03T07:00:11Z,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jan/03/self-assessment-tax-return-advice-help-vulnerable,Help for the vulnerable after HMRC closes tax inquiry centres,money,Money,The Guardian,"Older people may feel left in the lurch when it comes to getting help with filing accurate self-assessment returns and other tax problems after the closure of the last of HM Revenue and Customs’ 281 tax inquiry centres last summer. But new types of help are available to the 2.5 million people a year who previously used these centres. The decision to shut the centres, which used to provide face-to-face help, was taken after demand for their services halved, from 5 million visitors in 2005-06 to fewer than 2.5 million in 2011-12, as the vast majority of customers chose to get help by phone or online. Costs had also rocketed, with the average centre appointment reaching £152 by 2012. In contrast, the average cost of helping a customer by phone is £3, while an online transaction is just 9p. So the move made financial sense, saving HMRC £13m a year. But acknowledging that some vulnerable taxpayers – including many older people – would lose out, HMRC has invested in improved services to help such customers. “The issue for many older people is that this is the generation that really prefers the personal approach, and losing the ability to go and sort out their queries and concerns face to face has been something of a blow,” says Deborah Stone, managing director of specialist advice website Myageingparent.com. “Getting their tax returns accurate is very important, and it can be far from simple if you have a number of different incomes. This can cause unhealthy levels of anxiety and stress without the proper support. “Older people make least use of the internet, while many more will have hearing problems – so phoning a call centre can also pose difficulties. It’s important to know what routes are now available to get the right help.” If you need to make contact with HMRC, you can call their main telephone helpline numbers: either 0300 200 7950 or 0300 200 3300 between 8am and 8pm Monday to Friday and 8am to 4pm on Saturdays. Be warned that call waiting times can be long, but HMRC say they are working to improve their call “pick up” times. Once through to the contact centre, if the adviser is unable to resolve your issue, they can now transfer you to a specialist team where the officer you speak with will stay with you until your query is resolved. This new team is made up of experienced HMRC officers, who can liaise with other departments within HMRC, hold three-way conversations to include a family member or friend, and call you back once they have investigated your query. Another important development is that officers can transfer you to the services of the voluntary sector, where appropriate, if, for example, you want to complain about their service or an underpayment, or if you want to appeal a penalty. The new service can also be accessed directly via the voluntary sector: Citizens Advice (citizensadvice.org.uk); Tax Aid (taxaid.org.uk) and Tax Help for Older People (taxvol.org.uk) are the main organisations to contact. Age UK (ageuk.org.uk), will also be able to transfer your query to Tax Help for Older People, whose direct lines are 0845 601 3321 and 01308 488066.",profile/jillpapworth,Jill,Papworth

Inside, an introductory note advises you that the four parts of the book, the “four quarters to this story” – three stories and a poem, each about 100 pages long – can be read in any order “and the story will work”. The first quarter, the poem, written in blunt free verse, describes a girl living with her tribe in a forest beside a great lake. Some hunt; others are chosen to paint magical motifs inside nearby caves, bringing good luck. When they are attacked, the girl, unable to warn her tribe, intuits the possibility of writing: “If there was a way, / she thinks. / To make a mark in the sand. / And that mark to be known by all. / And that mark to have a meaning. / A meaning known to all. / There could be different marks / for different meanings. / Then there could be a mark to mean go / and one to mean follow.” Wandering in the forest, the girl notices spirals in snail shells and fern leaves. In the next three stories, spirals appear again and again. In “The Witch in the Water”, a fiercely puritanical priest has come from the city to purge the Welden Valley and its inhabitants of sinfulness; he sets his sights on Anna, the recently orphaned daughter of a “cunning woman”. Thrown into a pond by a mob of angry villagers, she sees a spiral carved into the rock: “There was some magic about that mark, something old and powerful, she was sure.” “The Easiest Room in Hell”, set in the 1920s, is the journal of a reforming young doctor, mourning the death of his drowned wife. Accompanied by his daughter, he takes a new job at the Orient Point insane asylum, whose occupants are housed in a seven-storey building constructed around a vast spiral staircase. The doctors have their offices at the top; the merely “disturb–ed” are on the floor below, and down at the bottom is the most severe case of all, Charles Dexter, once a successful poet, now a madman with a terror of spirals. Confronted with the staircase, Dexter screams “a howl right from the bottom of his mind, that spoke of unnameable horror at the world before him”. The final tale, “The Song of Destiny”, is the story of a spaceship travelling from Earth to find a new home for humanity, spinning through space in an ever-accelerating series of spirals. The ship carries 500 passengers and 10 crew; one of them is woken every 10 years to perform basic checks. There are several neat touches: the chapters are numbered not consecutively, but in the Our hero, Keir Fibonacci sequence; our hero is named Keir Bowman, his second name borrowed from the astronaut in 2001: A Space Odyssey, his first from the actor who played him. Bowman, dreams of spirals. When one of the sleeping passengers is murdered, he finds a spiral tattooed on her back. Then the onboard computer wakes him because it has detected signs of extraterrestrial life, a signal broadcasting the irrational number that produces a perfect spiral … The Ghosts of Heaven is an ambitious, intriguing and frustrating book: all these spirals hold out the promise of profundity and significance, but, in the end, seem to be no more than a way of linking otherwise unconnected narratives. All the tales are enjoyable, clever and nicely written, but unlike the most successful novels in this tradition – If On a Winter’s Night a Traveller;  Life A User’s Manual; Cloud Atlas – they never become greater than the sum of their parts. • Josh Lacey’s The Dragonsitter is published by Andersen.

It was 2001 and she had, until then, been labouring under the delusion she’d go to university and study languages. (Blunt wanted to be a simultaneous translator at the UN.) Instead, she found herself in a makeup chair backstage at the Haymarket theatre, being crept up on by Judi Dench, her co-star. “I just heard that voice in the room behind me,” Blunt says, “and I remember feeling the air go out of me. And she said, ‘Hello, darling. If anyone gives you any trouble in this, you come straight to me.’” Blunt has been lucky with her mentors; after Dench came Meryl Streep, whom she played opposite in The Devil Wears Prada, the bitchy assistant to the ruthless magazine editor. It was a role that bumped her, at the age of 23, to within spitting distance of A-list casting. These women set down a template by which the now 31-year-old actor has tried to abide: roughly, that there is a way to be successful in Hollywood without being a monster. “Judi is the perfect example, as is Meryl, of people who take the work so seriously and are meticulous about it, but never take themselves too seriously,” Blunt says. “To work with her right off the bat and see how she fronts a company and leads everybody with humour and grace: she was hugely inspiring.” No one notices Blunt in the hotel restaurant in Manhattan. She is slight, her hair pulled back ballerina-style, the kind of woman who looks good in tiny cardigans made of fine cashmere, a fact that belies her robust attitude to living. Blunt is happy to call out those films of hers that didn’t perform as expected at the box office (most recently, the sci-fi thriller Edge Of Tomorrow, in which she appeared with Tom Cruise) and profess disdain for getting caught up in the Hollywood machine. “You just adopt the amazing phrase, ‘Who cares?’” she says. “As soon as you have a child, it becomes the phrase that goes round and round my head all the time. Really.”    With James Corden in Into The Woods. Photograph: Rex Features   Hazel, the nine-month-old Blunt has with her husband, the actor John Krasinski, is not in New York on this four-day trip. (They are at home in California, where Hazel is only just sleeping through the night. Blunt didn’t want to disrupt her routine.) The actor was pregnant while making her latest movie, Into The Woods, and spent the latter stages of the shoot getting James Corden, her co-star, to throw out an arm or an elbow in front of her mid-section. The film is an unlikely Disney adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim stage musical, in which Anna Kendrick plays Cinderella, Christine Baranski the wicked stepmother and Meryl Streep the witch. Blunt is the baker’s wife, opposite Corden’s baker, and has the funniest lines, as well as a tiny bit of singing. “A tiny bit? Excuse me!” You sounded great. “You’re very nice, thank you.” Given that she’s not known for her singing, Blunt does have a surprisingly good voice. Rob Marshall, the director, cast for actors who could sing, rather than singers who could act, to preserve against the fate of many musicals, wherein the songs sound good, but mean very little. “Sondheim and Rob Marshall and the guys in the music department said, ‘We don’t need it to sound pretty, just make it work’,” Blunt says. In any case, none of the songs is particularly portable. “It’s that famous thing that Sondheim talks about, when he said people were up in arms about his music because you can’t hum it. And he hates that.” He’s pretty ornery. “In the most delightful way.” Blunt’s own appeal is rooted in a crisp, comic style that hits just the right note between realistic and arch, a sort of stylised normalcy that has made audiences warm to her since her film debut, the 2004 British drama My Summer Of Love, a coming-of-age story that won her instant recognition as a subtle and arresting actor. The Devil Wears Prada won her publicity, but it was her role in The Young Victoria, three years later, that marked her transition into a more substantial talent. It’s a modestly good film, in which Blunt depicts the young queen as by turns sombre, agonised and skittish, a performance marked by her ability to pare everything down. Hers is an approach that works well at rationalising silly material (Prada), or beefing up a thin script (Victoria). She has an ability to look all silent and trembly in a way that implies vast untapped reserves beneath the surface. Into The Woods, perhaps, then looks like a freeing exercise, a larky role in which she can break from the usual constraints, and which reunites her with her old buddy, Streep. Blunt suspects that, for Streep, who has been a great encourager over the years and whom she characterises as “a real broad – great fun”, it is a relief to work with former colleagues. “I feel like Meryl walks through life in a constant state of needing to defuse people’s intimidation of her. A weird way to exist. Maybe it helped that at least she didn’t have to worry about me.” Although, she adds, “It doesn’t mean I’m any less in awe of her.” The real virtue of Into The Woods is in its subversion of everything Disney has come to stand for. The sudden turn it takes from a neat happy ending into something nastier and messier is, of course, classic Sondheim, but unusual in the context of a Disney movie. (At the end of the first half, one of the characters gets her eyes pecked out by vengeful crows, a moment so unexpectedly violent, the whole cinema I was in burst out laughing with the surprise of it.) It is a return, Blunt says, to the good old days, when children weren’t cosseted. “Chris Pine [who plays the prince] was telling me that most schools in America only do the first act of the play, where everything is happy ever after. And it’s just sad that we’re choosing to coddle our children that way, because no one’s more perceptive than a child.” It wasn’t always so, Blunt adds. Look at the classic Disney tales: “Bambi loses his mother, Dumbo is wrenched away from his mother, who is chained up and tormented and bullied. It used to be darker and more challenging. Nobody goes through life unscathed. If you want to fairytale the shit out of everything, you’re doing everyone a disservice.”    Blunt’s desire to act was an anomaly in her family. She grew up in London, the second of four children, and although her mother, Janice, is a former actor and her father, Oliver, a QC (not a job exactly light on theatrics), it was assumed that she and her siblings would go to university as a matter of course. The others have (one sister, Felicity, is a literary agent who is married to the actor Stanley Tucci); her youngest sister is still studying, to be a vet, and couldn’t be less interested in Blunt’s line of work. “Absolutely zero interest. She said to me – she’s 23 – ‘Listen, I’m really proud of you, and it’s great, I just don’t want to talk about it all the time.’ The whole family loves movies and she was like, ugh.” She gives an approving laugh. The enthusiasm for acting started out partly as an effort to correct an early stammer. After joining various drama groups as a child, Blunt discovered that being in role made her fluent and gradually she outgrew the stammer. And it’s perhaps not too much of a stretch, she says, to say that she learned something about dramatic tension from watching her dad perform in court. “My dad, as a criminal defence lawyer, is in a perpetual state of pretending.” Pretending what? “That these men didn’t do what they did! Usually, they did. I’ve been there when the verdict comes in, and it is so dramatic and intense. An atmosphere you could cut with a knife.” What kind of defence lawyer is he? “He hasn’t defended any child molesters in a long time – early on in his career, he had to do that. But he hasn’t done anything related to young girls, because he has three daughters. He doesn’t like working with rapists. So he prefers, if you can you use that word, murder, drugs and fraud.” His jolliest case, she says, was defending some of the Millennium Dome robbers. “One diamond robber was a lovely old boy Dad said he felt bad for. They planned it so meticulously, and someone in their team tipped off the cops and they were waiting for them. And the guy said to my dad – they all call him “Olly”, which is bizarre – ‘Ah, Olly.’” Blunt puts on a Ray Winstone-like voice. “If I could just have touched it. I was so close!’ Dad was like, ‘I kind of wish he had!’” The oddness of Blunt’s career trajectory is that she became a professional actor before she’d even made the decision that acting was what she wanted to do. While studying in the sixth form at Hurtwood House, a boarding school in Surrey, she took part in a student production that went up to the Edinburgh festival fringe. It was a rock musical called Bliss and there were, she says, “eight people in the audience every night”. She was lucky; one of the drama teachers at the school was Adrian Rawlins, a professional actor (he plays Harry Potter’s dad in the movie franchise), who persuaded his agent, Roger Charteris, to attend the school performance in Edinburgh. Rawlins told him to look out for Blunt, and Charteris signed the teenager shortly afterwards. “He’s still my agent. I love continuity. I’ve worked with the same makeup artists for years. You create your own little family.”    In The Devil Wears Prada with Anne Hathaway and Meryl Streep. Photograph: Allstar/Tristar   After being cast in the West End play with Judi Dench, Blunt could have gone to drama school. “I was so green. I knew nothing. I don’t think I knew what I was doing for the first few years.” She had no particular expectations, which is “probably the best way to go into this. It’s not a business you want to rely upon. You’re not going to get promoted each year.” Looking back, Blunt is glad she went straight into professional work. “Drama school gives you a place to screw up and fuck up, and it gives you room for self-discovery and technique. I’ve also seen how it crushes people’s natural ability, and how it creates a space where you just overthink everything and become this neurotic performer. I’ve seen it both ways with friends, so I don’t know how it would have affected me. I just tried to sponge it up, to learn from everybody I was around. Acting is strange – it’s the ultimate expression of empathy. So if you’re interested in people and curious about life, and curious about everything other than this business, then you’ll probably get better.” After that first stage role, Blunt put in a few years popping up in TV shows such as Foyle’s War and Poirot. In 2005, she was cast in Empire, a blockbuster miniseries set in ancient Rome, and the following year starred in the Stephen Poliakoff TV drama Gideon’s Daughter, with Bill Nighy and Miranda Richardson, a role for which she won a Golden Globe. Then came The Devil Wears Prada. Since then, Blunt has been reliably good in movies as diverse as the romcom Salmon Fishing In The Yemen and Looper, the futuristic thriller that was somehow less than the sum of its parts. Her best role in recent years has been in Your Sister’s Sister, with Rosemary DeWitt and Mark Duplass, in which she hardly seems to be acting, and I mean that as a compliment.    Blunt loves the variable nature of her job, the “fresh injection of people” every six months that “keeps you vital”, although since having Hazel she has tweaked her schedule to allow for at least four or five months at home between projects. There is so much of a premium on an actor’s physical fitness that she was lucky her pregnancy came during a shoot where she could easily disguise it. For example, Blunt says, she couldn’t have made Edge Of Tomorrow while pregnant, given the amount of “clanging into each other in metal suits”. Despite disappointing returns at the box office – “And I was like, er, surely making $100m is doing well? But in this day and age it’s not” – Edge Of Tomorrow is having an afterlife. It is, Blunt says, the film she is most often approached about, by nerds wanting to discuss the metaphysical nature of its breach in the space/time continuum. Meanwhile, she says, she wouldn’t wish on anyone Cruise’s “absurd fame. You’ll never, ever be able to walk down a street without it being a meat market.” Into The Woods was a perfect vehicle, perhaps the one role in Hollywood for “an overweight and sort of happy-looking baker’s wife”. She finished filming in London, at Shepperton Studios, two months before giving birth, an odd conflation of life and art – much of Sondheim’s musical concerns the baker’s wife’s ravenous and eventually successful desire to have a baby, something Blunt sympathised with. “I have so many friends who are frenzied to have a baby, and it’s ruined their marriages and tormented them, and it becomes all they see in front of them.” Actors? “You see it particularly in actors – the precariousness of the job is what makes you suffer in the end, because you’re looking out for the next thing and the next thing and the next thing, and there’s never a good time. Same with every job, but I know a couple of actors who are in their 50s now and are really sad.” The night before we meet, Blunt was at an event with her Into The Woods co-star Christine Baranski, who gave her a reassuring pep talk about working mothers. “She was talking about being an actor and having kids, and she said the mothers who just want to be with their children all the time, I don’t know if that’s necessarily a good thing. Whereas the kids who are raised by a community of four or five people – your mum, his mum, a babysitter – they’re the kids who run through the door of the classroom and don’t look back. And that was so helpful for me to hear.”    In Young Victoria. Photograph: Rex Features   Krasinski is pretty reliable, she says, although since the baby is now on a schedule, “he just has to keep it all going and wash the bottles”. And does he? “He does! Which becomes the biggest turn-on in the world – just having the bottles done and the food ready for the next day.” While they’re at home in Ojai, a town about two hours north by car from Los Angeles, the couple live a determinedly low-key life – Blunt’s husband “is from Boston and the Bostonians are quite British in some ways” – something they disrupt now and then to, for example, attend George Clooney’s wedding. “In your mind, you’re just going to see your friends get married. But with the high possibility of it being documented by… everybody. It’s odd. It’s odd.” Existentially, it’s all a bit odd, the fairytale aspect of wealth and fame, and the darker side, too. But what are you going to do? Or, as Blunt would say, who cares? • Into The Woods is released on 9 January. Emily wears: Wool dress, £3,005, LouisVuitton.com. Beaded gown, £2,240, JennyPackham.com.

Teachers enter the staffroom as if they’re going to the gallows. Some sit down dejectedly, resigned to their fate, while others scan the room hoping for subversive complicity from anyone who might catch their eye. A final – more seasoned – few march to the back of the room, prepared with enormous piles of marking; the next two hours were not going to be a waste of time for them. Within moments, the speaker begins. What follows over the next two hours is a reiteration of the same ideas, using the same presentation we have seen before. All this on a bleak November night when outside the cold wind rips the dead leaves off the trees and the rain rattles against the windows. What could have been a relevant and useful inset session became an ordeal. It was something to endure before the weekend after it had already been a busy week. At the end of the two hours, you are left with a nagging suspicion that the inset has been called purely to satisfy the whim of an out of touch headteacher or, even worse, to fulfil the required number of hours in the school’s calendar. When I left the UK to live and work abroad I knew that there would be things that I would miss. But unlike the distance from my friends and family, cosy pubs and cheddar cheese, one challenge I didn’t expect to face was the lack of professional development – even if that has saved me from the odd hour of post-work horror and this, so far, has cast a small but distinct shadow over my experience. There were many reasons why I decided to leave, though significant among them was the frequently recurring feeling of having my head buckled down, my eyelids prised apart and my body squeezed into the increasingly tight straitjacket of target-driven, exam-orientated education. This, I thought, was not what I signed up for. But despite the undoubted flaws that exist in the system itself, the quality of the teaching and training in the UK is consistently high. And this is the problem I’ve found with international schools. Due to the relative freedom from inspection that these schools enjoy the powers-that-be seem to be far less interested in the performance of the teachers and students than in the wooing of parents. I remember an incident in my previous international school which caused a new teacher to quit in the first weeks of the year after an altercation with a student. After going to the senior management team for support, the teacher was told that the student was “off-limits” due to the family’s connection to the school. The child escaped with little more than an avuncular reminder of the rules. Examples of rule-bending for children of special parents are commonplace and, though this venality may keep the child (and fees) in the school in the short-term, it breeds resentful staff and an unruly student body who views the rules as a guide to desirable behaviour, rather than something which must be followed. This problem is exacerbated by the poor quality of training and the infrequent, and often irrelevant, observations. I have been observed only once in two years and, in both cases, by someone who did not teach my subject. According to general consensus, the feedback (if there is any) is often vague to the point of uselessness (“great lesson the other day!”) and given days late in the form of a friendly slap on the shoulder in the corridor between lessons.  This lack of intrusion may seem like a godsend, especially to those teachers afflicted with never-ending performance management observations. But the reality has been the reverse. I find myself teaching almost entirely what I like with no one to tell me whether or not what I am doing is correct or if it could be improved.  In all but the most extreme cases, the identification of struggling teachers is almost non-existent. Due to this and the lack of quality training and support for classroom management, many teachers in my school are not even able to have their students enter classrooms appropriately, on time and follow simple instructions, let alone allowing them off the leash to participate in more interactive activities.  This is not to say that good teachers do not exist in these schools or that they are too jaded to want to improve. Many teachers in my school would love to have relevant, focused and constructive staff training. They want training that can help them carry out their jobs with greater competence and confidence and allow them to convey their subject more effectively to their students.  But the system does not allow for the support and training needed. Instead, these schools, with their lax oversight, often seem to be a place where incompetence can hide unseen and even thrive.  The dearth of well-trained teachers means that un(der)qualified people are often promoted far beyond their level of competence. This trickles down through the school like a leaky pipe, corroding the whole system. The result is a demoralised staff who don’t respect their managers and a student body who do not achieve their potential. Often, neither staff nor students clearly understand what is expected of them or how they need to improve. Students go from class to class, experiencing wildly different teaching styles and classroom expectations and teachers do not know where to turn for help and so become bitter and frustrated. Ultimately, everyone suffers. The idea of attending an inset when you are exhausted and under pressure can feel like torture. That is why it is so important that the time schools allocate to staff development (including insets) is well-considered, targeted and engaging. After all, this is how we are told to teach our students. The least that schools can do is to show their teachers the same consideration. Follow us on Twitter via @GuardianTeach.

415,2015-01-03T08:26:11Z,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jan/03/emily-brothers-labours-first-transgender-candidate-interview,"Emily Brothers, Labour’s first transgender candidate: ‘I walked into the sea. Something brought me back’",society,Society,The Guardian,"When I rang the doorbell of Labour’s candidate for Sutton and Cheam, I thought I had a fairly clear picture of the woman I was about to meet. Anyone who stands for a party that polled 9% in the seat last time round has to be pretty bold. To do so as a blind woman with impaired hearing must take serious nerve. To have won the nomination without mentioning her transgender identity, then to announce it 12 months later without even warning her own party leader, suggests a degree of audacity uncommon even by the standards of politicians. Within days of her decision in December to out herself as Labour’s first transgender candidate, Emily Brothers was ridiculed by the Sun’s Rod Liddle, who wrote: “Being blind, how did she know she was the wrong sex?” By the time we meet a week later, Brothers has seen off his mockery with a crisp retort (“I wonder how he knows he’s a man when he turns the light out”), and extracted a rare public apology from the columnist, if not the tabloid. “If anyone thinks I’m just going to go quietly into the corner, they are sorely mistaken,” she says coolly, dismissing Liddle as “a ridiculous man writing in a rag of a paper”. Brothers’ manner is rather stiff and combative at first. She has been “impatient with the world” since her teens. “I don’t do rules very well,” she says, adding: “If people tell me I can’t do something, it’s like a red rag to a bull.” She can see no legitimate grounds for local party members who selected her to feel in any way deceived: “I don’t think I said anything during the selection hustings that was inauthentic.” But by the time I leave, invulnerable is the last word I would use to describe Brothers. Like many people who have lived with a secret for most of their life, she is not very skilled at telling her own story, and the narrative that unfolds is by turn halting and digressive. But once she has started, she doesn’t want to stop. She talks for more than three hours, weeps several times, and once or twice I’m almost moved to tears myself. Brothers has never known what she looks like. Born on Merseyside in 1964, the middle child of working-class parents who lived in a “very basic flat, two rooms, inner-city”, she was diagnosed with aniridia – a condition affecting the iris – at six months old, and spent the first 10 years of her life undergoing eye surgery, sometimes weekly, in a futile battle to save what little sight she had. At seven she became a weekly boarder at a Catholic school for blind and partially sighted children, and “began to feel more and more apart from my family, because my world was so different to theirs”. But she felt isolated within the school, too, unable to believe in God, increasingly insomniac and severely depressed by the time she reached her teens. “I didn’t even have the words to express it. I knew I had male characteristics, but all the time I just imagined myself as a girl.” She “acquired” a skirt and a top, and would wear them in secret, but was “terrified” of being caught. Getting into higher education was a battle – “In those days blind people went to rehabilitation centres. They did basket weaving, or piano tuning; the clever ones did physiotherapy” – but at Teesside university she became involved in student politics and “started to get the hang of socialising”. For the first time in her life, she learned of the existence of “cross-dressers, ladyboys in Thailand, that sort of thing. But that all sounded too sexualised, that wasn’t me.” With no access to magazines or newspapers or public libraries, she still had no name for how she felt, and though she had several girlfriends, she didn’t dare tell them about it. Working at an organisation for blind people in the late 80s, she fell in love with a colleague who was also blind, and in 1993 they married. “But I had serious doubts. Not about how I felt about her, but I did question whether it was the right thing for me to do, because I had this secret.” The couple had a son, then a daughter. When Brothers’ wife found a skirt hidden under their bed, she thought her husband was having an affair. It wasn’t until the internet arrived in the late 90s that Brothers began to read about gender identity, and finally understood her condition. She began attending meetings of the Beaumont Society, a transgender support group, found her way to a psychiatrist who specialised in transgender identity, and in the summer of 2006 summoned the courage to tell her wife. “She was shocked, but not surprised. She said it was like somebody suddenly switched on the lights. But it was very difficult. I got more depressed. I wanted us to stay together, but she didn’t want to be married to another woman, and I knew I wanted to live full time as Emily.” But Brothers wasn’t sure she ever could. She didn’t know what she looked like, so didn’t know if she could ever look like a woman. “I thought: don’t be ridiculous, no one will ever think you’re a woman, you can’t pass as a woman. I didn’t want to become some sort of point of ridicule for people to poke fun at. And I’d heard so many stories about people being harassed in the street. I thought: I don’t want to be a spectacle, and I don’t want to be a glamour model, I just want to live as an ordinary woman. And I didn’t understand that I could do that.”    Emily Brothers with Labour leader Ed Miliband at last year’s party conference in Manchester Photograph: PR   She was depressed and frightened. She began spending a lot of time alone at the family’s holiday home on the Isle of Wight. “And one night in December 2006 I was walking home along the sea front in the early hours of the morning, wearing men’s clothes. There was nobody around, and I walked down to the beach and walked into the sea.” She begins to cry. “If it had been a rough sea that night, a rough tide … I don’t think I had the physical strength to have fought it. I was fully dressed in the sea, up to my neck, but I didn’t quite have the courage to let go. And I stood there for ages. It was freezing, but I didn’t feel cold. And then something brought me back. I think it was probably my children. Thinking of my children.” She breaks off, weeping. “And I remember thinking that it was just a shambles, but if I couldn’t take my own life, I had to face up to it. I went back up the cliff top, back to the house. And it was sort of – I can’t live like this. I was upset, I was angry, I hated it. I took the clothes off – I hated them. It’s a symbol of something I don’t want to be. This isn’t me. I threw them in the bin. I just threw the clothes away. And after that, I was increasingly living as Emily.” After six months of rows, the couple told their children, then 12 and 10, and Brothers moved out of their south London home. “That was probably the worst day of my life, the day I left,” she chokes, breaking down in tears again. “I’d heard so much about other people losing contact with their children. I thought I might lose them. And of course, they were shell shocked. They said: ‘We still love you, but we don’t understand.’” Brothers moved to the Isle of Wight, underwent hormone and voice therapy, and began to live openly as Emily. “And when I went out, for a coffee, or shopping, I wasn’t being hassled. And I began to think: I might really be able to do this. This might be possible.” The vulnerability of not knowing what she looked liked is manifest in her relief and understated pride as she recalls the reassurance of others’ reactions. After she visited her wife a few months after moving out, she left in a local minicab and recognised the driver’s voice at once. “But when we started talking, he said: ‘Oh it’s a shame about Mrs Brothers. Her husband left her, you know. Apparently he was a terrible womaniser.’” When she moved back to London and returned to her job at the Equality and Human Rights Commission, another taxi driver told her: “I used to pick up a blind guy from your office, and he was a right miserable so-and-so. But you’re very chatty, love.” In 2008 she travelled to Thailand for genital surgery, and completed her transition. “I contemplated breast surgery, but fortunately I didn’t need it.” She touches her bust. “This is all me. Hormones did the job. Which is very, very unusual, and might suggest some kind of intersex.” Following the divorce, Brothers moved back into the former marital home, where she now lives with her 20-year-old son. “Six months ago,” she says, beginning to cry again, “my son said: ‘I miss my dad. But if you were to go through a gender reversal now – well, I don’t want to lose Emily.’” If her old neighbours have recognised her, none has ever said anything to her. She outed herself last month, only out of fear that if she didn’t, a newspaper might discover her secret and do it for her. Not once has anyone questioned her gender. In fact, the very first person ever to laugh at her was Liddle in the Sun. It hurt, she says, only because of what her parents must have thought. “I’m sure they’ll be aware of all the publicity about Rod Liddle. His joke probably just confirmed their worst suspicions about what the world thinks, and they’ll assume this is what I’ve been going through for years, people ridiculing me. Because they’ve never met Emily. They’ve never tried to get to know me.” When Brothers’ marriage was ending, she travelled north to tell her parents why. “But I knew my family was never going to accept me. They said it was a midlife crisis, they said: ‘You need to go to the doctors and get a pill.’ Then they got very angry after I left, and we’d talk on the phone, and they said: ‘You’re sick in the head, you’re going to be toddling around the streets and people are going to be laughing at you. How could you do this to us? Are you satisfied now?’ They were very aggressive.” Eventually she wrote to them to say: “Until you can respect me and give me some dignity, then contact can only be by correspondence.” She hasn’t seen or spoken to them since. In 2013, 10 days before Christmas, Brothers received a letter from her parents telling her that her younger brother had died a month earlier. “It said: ‘We didn’t invite you to the funeral because we can’t have someone like you there.’” Her voice falters. “That’s how deep it goes. I wrote back to them and said: ‘I know this is such a difficult time, but it was wrong to exclude me. I enclosed some Harvester vouchers and said please, go out and have a meal.’ I got a letter back saying: ‘You don’t know what it’s like, we’ve now lost two sons, and we’re sending the vouchers back because if we eat your food we’ll choke on it.’” • This article was amended on 3 January 2015 to correct the spelling of Isle of Wight. It was further amended on 5 January 2015. An earlier version said both Rod Liddle and the Sun had apologised to Brothers. That is true only of Liddle.",profile/deccaaitkenhead,Decca,Aitkenhead
416,2015-01-03T08:30:12Z,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/03/how-i-gave-up-twitter,How I gave up Twitter,lifeandstyle,Life and style,The Guardian,"Over the course of my 32 years on Earth, I have come to accept that I am a show-off. And there is no better place to draw an audience than on Twitter. I am on it constantly and, over the years, I have gathered a few thousand followers (OK, 13,800 at the time of writing). In return, I post news and photos, videos and gifs, and a few jokes (that I spend far too much time crafting). In the grand scheme of addictions, it’s not on a par with crack or clear spirits, but, faced with a week without it, I felt a genuine pang. It’s not as if I need it, I rationalised. I just really like it. A lot. I signed off Twitter on a Wednesday night, and after telling my followers I would not be doing #Bims10Things, my weekly collection of things I’ve found and loved on the internet, I stepped into the unknown. On day one, en route to the station, I spotted a woman with stunning green makeup. My first reaction was to go to my phone and broadcast this banality; I stopped myself just in time. On the train platform, I once again reached for my phone to check the news of the day. Without Twitter, I barely remembered where to start. I have curated my timeline to be a sophisticated news sieve. Without it, I am having to do the filtering myself. I wouldn’t recommend it. Day two was a Friday, which usually means #Bims10Things. I went to launch the app a couple of times before catching myself and closing it guiltily. I realised I have optimised its placement for my thumb to find first, which is… troubling. I worked from home, and every freelancer knows Twitter is basically a portable office. I felt its absence keenly. The next day, I recreated an amazing kale and apple salad that I’d had in New York, and made parmentier potatoes from scratch. Without a Twitpic, though, can I even be sure I’ve got this right? I didn’t watch Strictly or X Factor – with no live-tweeting, and no opportunity to take the piss, there is no point. I want to claw my face off. The fourth day turned out to be the hardest of the week: musician Solange Knowles, aka the crush of my life, got married, and it was perfect. This is my Twitter bread and butter! I genuinely felt sad not being able to tweet about it. So I made up witty little comments in my head and set my jaw. Eventually, I deleted the app from my phone before temptation got the best of me. The next few days were calmer, possibly because I’d started to accept that I might be able to live without Twitter, though more likely because the end was in sight. A large man in a camel coat bumped me with his bag for three stops on the train, and I amused myself by drafting intricate insults in 140 characters or fewer. By day seven, I realised that practically everything I’d read in the week had been on paper. I felt like a 90-year-old. I began a countdown to the magical “tweet again” hour. And then I was free. The lesson here is: you can do anything you set your mind to, and having that knowledge is a beautiful, powerful thing. But should you? My week without Twitter was hell. There is no doubt in my mind that I rely on it far too much – for work, for entertainment, for knowledge and for relaxation. It is the first thing I reach for when idling at a bus stop; most of the time, I will select it over a book. Is it healthy? Probably not. But I don’t do drugs or even alcohol, so this feels benign in comparison. I am a useless millennial, and come the resources wars of the future, I may well be killed in the first wave. But I’ll probably be live-tweeting my demise.",profile/bim-adewunmi,Bim,Adewunmi

For many and many a year I sang songs. Whenever I tried to sing of love, it turned to pain. And again, when I tried to sing of pain, it turned to love. Schubert, “My Dream”, manuscript, July 3, 1822 Winterreise – Winter Journey – a cycle of 24 songs for voice and piano based on poems by Wilhelm Müller, was composed by Franz Schubert towards the end of his short life. He died in Vienna in 1828 aged only 31. Piano-accompanied song is no longer part of everyday domestic life and has lost its one-time primacy in the concert hall. What Germans know as Lieder – is a niche product, even within the niche that is classical music; but Winter Journey is an indispensable work of art that should be as much a part of our common experience as the poetry of Shakespeare and Dante, the paintings of Van Gogh and Picasso, the novels of the Brontë sisters or Marcel Proust. The 24 songs are forerunners, in a sense, of all those songs of love and loss that have been the soundtrack of generation on generation of teenagers. But the loss of love, which is only sketched ambiguously in the first song, “Goodnight”, is just the beginning of it. Schubert’s wanderer embarks on a journey through a winter landscape that leads him to question his identity, the conditions of his existence – social, political and metaphysical – and the meaning of life. And it is all done with light and shadow, moving between sardonic humour and depressive longing. (Not surprisingly, Beckett was one of the cycle’s biggest fans.) The wanderer’s tears turn to ice; he sees flowers etched in the frost of the hut where he takes refuge; he is eyed from the sky by a carrion crow, his only faithful companion; and at the last, he sees a beggar musician playing in the street, ignored and unrewarded, the hurdy-gurdy man.    Der Leiermann – The Hurdy-Gurdy Man Over there behind the villageStands a hurdy-gurdy man,And with numb fingersHe grinds away, as best he can. Barefoot on the iceHe sways back and forth,And his little plateRemains always empty. No-one wants to hear him,No-one looks at him,And the dogs growlAround the old man. And he lets it go on,Everything, just as it will;Turns the wheel, and his hurdy-gurdyNever stays still for a moment. Strange old man,Should I go with you?Will you to my songsPlay your hurdy-gurdy? There is a Romantic irony embedded in the title of this last poem. The German leier, or lyre, was the most Romantic of instruments, so how apt, poignant and poetic to have ended this cycle with a lyre song. This, however, is no ordinary lyre, but a vulgar, indecent hurdy-gurdy, a Drehleier (a rotating or turning lyre), the chosen instrument of the musically unaccomplished beggar, the lowest of the low. The hurdy-gurdy is the fiddler’s version of the bagpipe. The sound box can be that of a fiddle, a guitar or a lute, but the strings are neither plucked nor bowed. Instead, a wheel in the middle sets the strings vibrating as it is turned by a crank. As a result, the hurdy-gurdy can seem mechanical and dissociating – the perfect instrument, at once ancient and modern, for the expression of alienation. Styles of singing are bound by convention; it is the musical context in which listeners hear them that determines whether they sound “natural” or “mannered”. The simple classical delivery of a folk song by a “trained” voice may sound uptight and artificial to an audience used to hearing “Barbara Allen” or “O Waly Waly” in the nasal twang that has become associated with an “authentic” folk voice. Crossing boundaries is perilous, and on the whole, opera singers sound as wrong in pop music as pop singers do in German song. At the same time, crossing boundaries, respectful borrowings and outrageous thefts do essential work in keeping any art form alive. Admiring vocalism from Bob Dylan to Billie Holiday to Frank Sinatra, I have always thought that, in principle, one should be influenced by these extraordinary singers and their compelling way of bending melody to words and vice versa. Classical song and popular song should not be so far apart: they share a lot in their subject matter and in their aesthetic of intimacy. Mostly, however, the influence has to be a subliminal one, for only then can it avoid self-consciousness or a certain archness. One of the rare occasions on which I became conscious of channelling a different kind of musical expression was in a concert in Moscow. I’ve often reimagined “Der Leiermann” as a sort of Dylan song that doesn’t conform to classical norms in singing, but it is hard to achieve the requisite vibe. On this occasion, however, it clicked: I felt a connection with the greatest Dylan love song performance on record, the bitter masterpiece “Don’t Think Twice, It’s All Right” on The Freewheelin’ Bob Dylan. Schubert’s “Hurdy-Gurdy Man” emerged as a song that was hardly sung, rasping and guttural by the standards of bel canto, but without sounding – I hope – like a ridiculous intrusion of pop singing into the classical world. I have no idea if Dylan was aware of Winterreise. Given his eclectic influences in the 1960s – from Rimbaud to Brecht to Elvis to the Beat poets – it is not such an outlandish suggestion. There is a definite kinship between Schubert’s hurdy-gurdy player and Dylan’s tambourine man. This weary but not sleepy poet-wanderer talks of how you might hear “laughin’, spinnin’, swingin’ madly across the sun”; of disappearing “far past the frozen leaves / The haunted, frightened trees”. It’s not a million miles from his jingle jangle to Schubert’s hurdy-gurdy. It is entirely appropriate that Schubert gave the wretched old hurdy‑gurdy man “poor music”. Our wanderer’s existential misery is for the first time confronted with real distress, unchosen and stoically borne. The world of Beckett here collides with that of Henry Mayhew, the Victorian cartographer and ethnographer of the London poor, or of Sebastião Salgado, the documentary photographer of contemporary Brazilian life; and as listeners we are taken aback. At the same time, we feel, and are meant to feel, pity and revulsion in equal measure as we encounter this outcast fragment of humanity with his irritating little folksy tune, droning on and on. Our compassion is complex, and what ultimately complicates it is the fear that this lonely, squalid figure could be us. There but for the grace of God go you or I. We are repelled and we are drawn in; we resist, but also admire the fortitude of one who can carry on in such circumstances. Could we do the same? If the poem resonated with Schubert it’s because he, too, was a musician. Historically, he is the first of the canonical “great” composers to have made his living solely in the marketplace, without a patron, a position in the court or church, or a musical sinecure. He was by no means the unsuccessful unknown of legend and made plenty of money from his compositions. But his position was perilous. He led a bohemian life, financially insecure.    Bob Dylan. Photograph: Elliott Landy Photograph: Elliott Landy/press   During the middle ages, instrumentalists had been viewed as incompetent in legal matters: they were not allowed to be judges, witnesses, nor jurors; ineligible for land tenure; unable to serve as guardians or to hold civic office; not accepted by the trade guilds; and had no right to normal damages as plaintiffs in a civil case. Laws changed but the stigma remained, allied to the deep-rooted suspicion of the rootless and of those whose musical activities verged on the mystical, the magical, and the shamanic-demonic – the tale of the Pied Piper of Hamelin had cast a long shadow. Müller’s hurdy-gurdy player, then, must have seemed particularly appealing to a composer and musician living on the threshold of modernity, all too conscious of the dangers of falling into the terrifying state of indigence that the old man represents. Schubert’s awareness of his own prognosis – the terrifying fate of the syphilitic, the inevitable physical and mental deterioration – can only have intensified these fears. Up until “The Hurdy‑Gurdy Man” Winterreise has been a “monodrama”. Everything has been presented to us by the poetic voice, the wanderer; and neither Müller nor Schubert has played sophisticated games by suggesting shiftiness in the narration. The story may be incomplete, even reticent or teasing, but the narrator is not unreliable. Everything is filtered through the wanderer’s subjectivity, even if the harmonic transformations of the piano part sometimes seem to reflect more the unconscious than the conscious mind. In this last song, however, a notional source of alternative subjectivity, however pinched and etiolated, presents itself: the hurdy-gurdy player. What is achieved, in the end, is a wonderful circularity, with the musical-poetical serpent biting its own tail, and the tantalising offer of narrative closure, an explanation for what has been going on. We now see the possibility that the hurdy-gurdy player may have been there all along, and have been the very occasion for the wanderer singing his woes. “Will you play your hurdy-gurdy to my songs?” the wanderer asks. If the answer were to be a “yes”, then the crazy but logical procedure would be to go right back to the beginning of the whole cycle and start all over again. This could explore a notion of eternal recurrence: we are trapped in the endless repetition of this existential lament. Alternatively, the first sing-through could be the monodrama with pianistic imaginarium that we all experienced, but with the second, and subsequent, performances given to the accompaniment of the hurdy-gurdy. The cycle ends with a final cadence that, in its open-endedness, allows us the freedom to choose our own ending. What happens after a performance of Winterreise is a little mysterious but usually follows a pattern. Silence emerges as the last hurdy-gurdy phrase dissipates into the hall, a silence that is often extended and forms part of the shared experience of the piece; a silence performed as much by the audience as it is by singer and pianist. A mute, stunned applause usually follows, which can swell into noisier acclaim. Acclaim? Acclaim for what? For the composer? For the music? For the performance? Is applause, and the performers’ acceptance of it, somehow impertinent? It sometimes, indeed often, feels that way. The normal rules of the song recital are in abeyance. No encores are prepared or expected and, however enthusiastically the audience respond, none will be forthcoming.    Schubert by Wilhelm August. Photograph: The Art Archive/Corbis Photograph: Alfredo Dagli Orti/The Art Archive/Corbis   Winterreise can seem a little intimidating. Its 24 gloomy songs are to be taken in one, extended, 70-minute dose. It shouldn’t be like that. The music of the cycle is varied and engagingly weird – Schubert’s friends were shocked when they first heard it. It is full of energy, despair, passion, sensuality and gallows humour. It is a drama, too, a piece of theatre, with its own rhythm, and a crucial role for the confrontation between singer and audience. Not to forget the piano, which turns sonic imagery – rustling leaves, posthorns, a falling leaf – into a psychological landscape. Singer as ego, piano as id. By placing the piece in as broad a context as possible – exploring its roots in the 1820s, its resonances now, its personal meaning for Schubert and for others, listeners and performers – I hope I’ve provided a way in to one of the great creations of the western musical tradition. • Schubert’s Winter Journey: Anatomy of an Obsession by Ian Bostridge is published by Faber at £20.

418,2015-01-03T08:30:13Z,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/03/how-i-gave-up-fine-dining,How I gave up fine dining,lifeandstyle,Life and style,The Guardian,"“You have the best job in the world,” is what almost everyone says to me on the rare occasions I tell them what I do for a living. (Closely followed by “I could do that”, but let’s not go there.) I’d agree with them: I’m ridiculously lucky to be able to indulge my love for restaurants on an almost daily basis – way more when I’m abroad – and my job frequently fills me with joy. It also fills me with a lot of other stuff. Recent studies tell us that eating in restaurants is even more unhealthy than a fast food habit. I could have told you that without the study: I don’t know many McDonald’s fans who preface their Big Mac with a nice frosty martini and mull over which bordeaux will go with the fries. But mostly I could have told you by looking at my legs, latterly dead ringers for a pair of sausage skins stuffed with porridge. My life is sedentary: plonked in front of menus or the computer screen. I loathe gyms or classes or any kind of organised activity; Pilates bores me to distraction. I can’t stand ploughing up and down the lanes of a swimming pool. So, day after day, I sit on my ever-expanding, distinctly non-Kardashian arse. Something needed to be done. Prompted by a recent David Sedaris article, I buy a Fitbit, a pimped-up pedometer. It gives me 10,000 steps to do as a target and I’m rapidly addicted. I know! Turns out that walking I can do. It’s such a wake-up call, making me realise how the computer screen can very quickly turn into a wormhole, sucking me in for hours while my body gently spreads around me. If I find that I can’t do the steps outdoors, I take to stoating around the island in my kitchen or stomping up and down in front of the TV. My family moves out, husband to shed, daughter to room: I’m not much fun to be around. But I feel so much better and the porridge is starting to dissipate. Eventually this plateaus out – there are only so many hours in the day for stoating – and I wonder, what next? The appeal of a short, sharp weightloss plan is obvious: I research endless residential detoxes, from the spa in France where you’re fed by Gallic superchef Michel Guérard to the glamorous one in Thailand where you spend days examining your own poo. But my guilt demands something way more hairshirted, and eventually I find a place in the middle of nowhere, where the ethos is rigid and the sybaritism low. It offers, through a raw food diet and holistic practices, to rebalance my mind, body and soul. Testimonials from previous residents gush about changing lives for the better in one week and giving up wheat, dairy, coffee, tea, red wine. Oh, really? But it promises a quick fix kickstart for healthy weight loss. The pal recruited to chum along and take the bare look off my antisocial tendencies sends me a link to a Victoria Wood playlet, Mens Sana In Thingummy Doodah, in which the spa is led by Julie Walters and the bedspreads are candlewick. Our destination immediately becomes Candlewick, and so it remains for the duration. Day 1 The train leaves from St Pancras in London, so obviously the pal and I breakfast on Fortnum’s bacon sandwiches and mushrooms on toast (lovely dark shrooms, fried, licked with a bit of cream and tarragon, and piled on to buttery toast) in anticipation of starvation. We’re not sure whether we feel excited or doomed. We have no idea where we’re going on the map, but it turns out to be beautiful: quintessentially English landscape, grey churches, rolling fields, village pub and fields scattered with animals. Candlewick is pretty, too: honey-coloured stone buildings around a central courtyard occasionally crossed by serious-looking women in grey tunics. The interior is like an explosion in a wallpaper factory, the temperature menopausal. My room is nice in a Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen way – faux-French furniture and a lot of lilac and purple – and the bathrooms are sleek and well-appointed with a lot of loo roll. Our introductory talk is “COMPULSORY” and enlightening. A whole blah blah about their ethos and the health benefits, weight loss and energy gains about to be bestowed upon us through eating hardly anything, all of it vegetal, most of it juiced, all of it raw. “There are hairdryers and robes and water bottles in your rooms,” we’re told. “We do count them, so if they find their way into your suitcases, they find their way on to your bills.” Our directrice delivers, in sombre tones, a depressing list of millennial toxins, in the air and on our plates. “You must also avoid cosmetic oils, hair dye and fake tan.” Crikey! More poisons to worry about? “Because,” she continues, “they stain our sheets.” It transpires that we’re not allowed to use our phones anywhere in the communal parts. Wait – what? Starve me if you like, but don’t take away my phone. I have my introductory health check, which involves measurements. I can’t remember the last time I measured myself and I gasp in horror: I’m basically a Weeble. My blood pressure is very high. No wonder. We’re to live on juices, mixed vegetables and fruit, served from a hotel-breakfast style dispenser that usually features a weirdly alive-looking scum. Then soup in the evenings: basically pulped veg with added boiling water. Routinely, there are also bullet-sized fibre pills, a mucousy fibre drink, shots of lemon juice and violently green superfoods that taste as though something has been recently exhumed. There’s no cooking at all. I feel fear for the first time. We’re given our “weeksheets”: days composed of various exercises and treatments punctuated by juices. My world has suddenly shrunk. Our talk tonight is about digestion, the mucoid plaque and bowel movements, plus a certain procedure we’re to undergo. Of a terrifying-looking colonic machine, we’re told, “Sometimes, in the viewing panel, you can see the likes of mushrooms and jacket potato.” I snort like a teenager. “Meals” are communal, the embodiment of all my dinner party phobias. We are all female. An American woman with oddly grey teeth who otherwise sleeps in her room all day asks me if I’ve ever fasted before. Does going without sausage rolls for a week count? R&R is the evening film. Tonight’s is called Food Matters: various rather unhealthy-looking men chunter on about raw food to a bad clubby soundtrack. But at the end of it, I want to mainline vitamin C and niacin. Day 2 After “breakfast”, the first thing on the agenda is Nordic walking. It turns out to be that thing I’ve laughed at for ages: people marching about with the help of what look like ski poles. Off we set through lovely, frost-kissed countryside, and within seconds I’m miles behind everyone else in their impressive sports kit. I can’t do it – it’s like rubbing your stomach and patting your head at the same time. “I can’t just leave you in a field,” the instructor frets. She then leaves me in a field and I trudge back to the mothership to watch Frasier in my room. Conversation, whether at the table or in the infrared sauna or kitchen, displays an Olympic level of self-obsession – and not just from me. People will happily talk about their sinuses for hours, or the various sadnesses that led them to detoxing as a solution. One beautiful creature is less navel-gazing: “I just need to lose a couple of inches because I take me kit off for a living.” We all have treatments, Hoover-like machines galumphing over our bodies, or things like electric toothbrushes furnished with tiny needles skittering over our faces. The house tone of voice is sing-song, for addressing idiots (“Just pop yourself on here. Just pop off your undies”). I ask one of the therapists what was the most unusual reason she’d heard for detoxing: “Well, there was one guy whose bowels stopped working after he gave up the marijuana.” Tonight’s talk from the directrice is on detoxification: briefly, acid foods bad, alkaline foods good. And you should never reuse plastic water bottles, because it makes you grow breasts or something. Apparently emotions, too, can be acid or alkaline. “I’m feeling some acid emotions towards her,” the pal says. I wander into the kitchen and the smell is intoxicating: the raw food chef is preparing kale chips in the dehydrator. My heart soars: are these for tonight? They’re not. I’m devastated. And I can’t believe my heart soared over kale chips. Is it only Day 2? Day 3 Let us never talk of what happened today. Never. Day 4 I’m hallucinating food, and not yer fancy-schmancy restaurant food, but mature cheddar bubbling over sourdough toast, macaroni cheese, homemade sausage rolls. The hallucinations extend to my sense of smell: the whole compound seems to be fragranced with bacon. You’re supposed to fill out a form to say what food you’d like the following day. I haven’t done so; I didn’t know I was supposed to. “You were told at the induction,” the directrice admonishes, “but you were too busy nattering.” It has come to this: I’ve been told off for nattering. The soups are called fanciful and toe-curling things like Bright Eyed And Bushy Tailed, but all seem to consist of the same things: carrot, celery, onion and parsnips, in varying ratios. An earth-shattering occurrence: actual men have arrived. Day 5 I make the mistake of asking one of the new men why he’s here and get a 15-minute disquisition on himself. And I thought us gals were self-obsessed. His hair is dyed an unconvincing aubergine, his jokes are painful and he likes to tell us what we laydeez are thinking; he’s like an old, northern, David Brent. He comes accessorised with a meek, whiskery chum, the Madge Allsop to his Dame Edna. We are, by now, institutionalised, mechanically padding in our gowns from yoga to gym class to treatment to juice. Both the pal and I come laden with books, but hardly open a page – our brains seem to have turned to butternut squash. I stare at the TV, but there’s so much eating going on. Oh god no, not Jamie’s Comfort Food. I end up locked on to something called ITVBe, where nobody much seems to eat. I may be tackling my dependence on carbs, but I’m now addicted to Millionaire Matchmaker. There’s basically bugger all else to do. Even the village contains nothing but a church and a pub. Oh, wait a moment… No, no. In every sense of the phrase: not going there. The pal and I jump ship and go to the pub. But once there, we nurse a pair of (forbidden) sparkling waters. What have we become? There’s a raw food demonstration by the in-house “gourmet chef” who has the most preternaturally hairy arms. Everyone has turned up for this because – food. She teaches us how to make cucumber and avocado soup (put cucumber and avocado in a blender) and nut milk (put nuts and water in a blender). As a special treat, there are minuscule shot glasses filled with a dessert made from raw cacao and avocado; their effect on my co-detoxers makes the words ravening hyenas spring to mind. Tonight’s film – to which we’ve been looking forward all week – is Fat, Sick And Nearly Dead. Day 6 More of the bloody same. I can’t get out of bed. I lie under the duvet, watching ITVBe while everyone else Nordic walks and yogas. Oh no: Dinner Date. I don’t even make it to the evening movie, Forks Over Knives. I feel I’ve got the constantly drummed-home message: what I’m eating is killing me, yada yada. And even the constant scenic shots of piles of vegetables now cause me to salivate like Old Faithful. Day 7 The sun is shining and I feel grrrrreat. Clear of eye and bouncy of step. I’m not even starving. My face has lost its puffiness and I’ve slept like a baby all week, not having to touch the armoury of sleeping aids I always travel with. I’ve hardly been near social media and have deleted all the stupid app games I use the way I used to use cigarettes. Dear Lord, is this a new me? While getting dressed, ITVBe shows a programme where Olly Murs – someone I’m normally entirely immune to – surprise visits a couple of teenage fans. Their reaction makes me burst out crying. We have our leaving analyses: I’ve lost 5lb and several inches – more in a week than I managed doing the 5:2 diet for six months. But most importantly, my porridgey limbs are looking vastly improved: Candlewick has come up with the goods. The pal has lost 8lb, despite not even once drinking the Kool-Aid – she didn’t even drink the bloody juices, having actual breakfast (albeit a thin layer of millety stuff garnished with three blueberries and a quarter of a strawberry) and salads. She’s still not buying it: “When you eat and drink as much as we do, any kind of break is bound to have results.” I’m inclined to agree: I didn’t need to be force-fed kale juice, I just needed to be locked away from bars and restaurants for a week. And to move more. Quite bluntly, to get off my backside. God, it feels good to be free. What a week it’s been: I’ve never ingested so much cucumber, drunk so much herbal tea or showed my naked arse to so many strangers. And a considerably peachier arse it now is. Back home Well, it was a Ginger Pig sausage roll…",profile/marina-oloughlin,Marina,O'Loughlin
419,2015-01-03T08:30:13Z,https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2015/jan/03/how-engage-students-lessons-after-holidays,How to use brain science to engage students after the holidays,teacher-network,Teacher Network,The Guardian,"As the holidays come to an end, thoughts of students and lesson plans replace time spent indulging in puddings and turkey. But teachers know all too well that it’s challenging enough to motivate a class on a Monday morning after a weekend, nevermind after a longer break. To reignite energy levels this January here are my tips as a neurologist and former teacher: What gets the brain’s attention? All learning starts as information perceived by the five senses: vision, hearing, touch, taste and smell. There are also millions of sensory nerve endings throughout the skin, muscles and internal organs. But the brain is only able to process about 1% of this information and it gives priority to certain things. With the help of brain imaging, we can see that the sensory information that gets priority is that which helps mammals survive. This tends to be information that is unexpected – our attention filter first takes in sensory information about change and novelty. On the first day back get your class to share stories After a break, there is a higher than normal amount of new sensory information competing for access to the brain. Students have not seen each other for a while and the novelty of returning to school is enhanced by their interest in what classmates did during the holidays.  So beginning the first day back by returning immediately to routine is unlikely to get your students’ attention and can cause bad behavior and inattention. But if you know that a child’s brain is programmed to be curious about new experiences and what friends have done, you can use it to promote important qualities. Students are likely to want to tell their class about what they got for Christmas or a trip they’ve been on. Tell them they can do this but only if they also share something that they did for others or generous acts that they saw or heard about. Get class attention through curiosity It’s essential that students remember the information you teach them. For this to happen, you can use strategies to make sure the sensory information you provide (through what you say, show, do or have them experience through physical movement) gets through their attention filters. Once students have had the chance to satisfy their curiosity about classmates, you can redirect their focus to classroom instruction by starting with sensory input that is most likely to get through the attention filter. Through neuroimaging research, we know the types of novelty or change that get attention priority include movement, curious objects, pictures, videos, unexpected class visitors or speakers, changes of colour and things you do that are unusual. So why not wear something unusual? Have music playing when children enter class, open with a dynamic video clip, a curious picture, or an optical illusion?  Here are some other suggestions: What you say (or don’t say). A sudden mid-sentence silence is a curiosity the attention filter wants to know more about. A suspenseful pause in your speech before saying something important increases alertness and memory of what you will say or do next.  Change the furniture arrangement. Or put up photos of last year’s students doing an activity your students will be doing in the unit they are beginning, light a candle, put a new exciting poster relating to the new unit under the one that has been hanging and when you walk by, “inadvertently” bump into the wall so the old one falls down and the new one is suddenly revealed. Get moving. Since movement gets high priority, you can move in an unexpected way such as doing what you usually do (handing out papers or posting information on the walls) while walking backwards. That could lead to a lesson about negative numbers, negative electric charges, going “back” in history, or the past tense of verbs. Rotate techniques, lest the unexpected become expected. Greet students at the door with a riddle or a note card with a vocabulary word. They can seek their new seats by looking for the table with the note card that has the riddle answer or the definition of their word. Good teachers are highly responsive to their students’ moods and needs. Knowing a bit of the neuroscience can help you prepare for times when it’s harder to get your students’ attention. I recall a poster that read: “A Mind Stretched Will Never Revert to its Original Size.” That mind stretching is what teachers do. Using strategies to first captivate their attention will hook into their brains’ intake programing, stimulate their curiosity, and sustain the attentive focus needed to turn information into knowledge.

Marula trees grow across southern Africa and in parts of east and west Africa. The oil is extracted from the hard kernels of its fruits. Until the late 1990s, the sole major commercial use of marula oil was for the South African cream liqueur, Amarula.  That changed when a women’s cooperative in Namibia began to develop the oil for use in the cosmetics industry. Within a year it was discovered by the Body Shop; by 2011, the company was using it in more than 140 products, sourced exclusively from Namibia, according to a case study by the World Intellectual Property Organisation. With higher levels of antioxidants and omega 9 acid than argan oil, another skincare superstar, marula oil provides some of the best natural protection against environmental damage and free radicals that lead to early ageing.  Marula oil will soon be commercially produced and marketed in east Africa, thanks to Philip Leakey, a Kenyan farmer with 6,000 marula trees growing naturally on his 3,000 acre farm. He is planting a further 50,000.  Leakey and his business-partner and wife, Katy, have so far produced more than 6,000 litres of marula oil on their farm, Ol Kerii, in Kenya, selling it in the US through the Leakey Collection, a fair trade company they built to promote entrepreneurial opportunities that complement the environment and culture of rural Kenyans.  This year, they will launch new marula oil products at a lower price for the east African market. Most mass-produced marula oils are obtained by crushing the kernel, sometimes together with the nut and flesh, and extracting the oil using heat and chemicals. However, this process destroys the oil’s natural antioxidant properties. To avoid this, Leakey has built a modular, mobile cold-press system that extracts the oil. His team cuts the kernels by hand first to remove the rancid ones. To date, much of the selection of marula trees by international agricultural organisations has been for fruit size, to produce more pulp, rather than for kernel size. “Scientific selection for pulp is the opposite to what you want for oil, we’ve found on the farm,” Leakey says. He is now selecting trees based on the size of the kernel.  Concessions of trees have been carefully selected from across east Africa so that nuts are ripening at different times of the year in different areas. Harvesting is spread over 10 months, which makes labour, production chains and storage easier to manage.  Ol Kerii’s marula oil gives regular work to about 800 people, 95% of them women. There is no factory, no clocking-in and clocking-out. Workers, once trained, can do as many (or as few) hours as they want, so it doesn’t interrupt the demands of daily life. But pay-scales rise in line with how much work you do, to incentivise production.  For a full day, an average worker might take home $10 (£6.40). According to the UN, rural wages in Kenya usually vary between 3,000 and 9,000 shillings – $35-104 – a month. Leakey believes that marula oil could develop into a multibillion-dollar business, and estimates that the Ol Kerii business alone could create work for 10,000 people. The communities currently hacking down marula trees to make way for farmland, he fears, are missing out on a huge opportunity.      ",profile/jessica-hatcher,hatcher-moore,jessica

But with many great artists, we can’t definitively say that their grandeur is not grossness, their profundity superficiality. The uncertainty principle was formulated brilliantly in 1759, when Sir Joshua Reynolds said of Michelangelo: “I have seen figures by him of which it was very difficult to determine whether they were in the highest degree sublime or extremely ridiculous”; too great an indulgence of imagination produced “incoherent monsters”, Reynolds said, while too much restraint resulted in “lifeless insipidity”. What would Reynolds have made of his Spanish near-contemporary, Goya, who takes us on an ethical-aesthetic roller coaster ride, both attractive and repulsive? Goya is now routinely considered the first “modern” artist, the first – and last – who dared look evil in the eye, then punch it on the nose. Thus Robert Hughes: “His work asserted that men and women should be free from tyranny and superstition; that torture, rape, despoliation and massacre … were intolerable.” Really? Or did he not – artistically, at any rate – rather enjoy it? Was not barbarity, ugliness and superstition the making of Goya? Was he not like William Blake’s Milton, when he wrote Paradise Lost (“of the Devil’s party without knowing it”), and so a great artist? An exhibition opening soon at the Courtauld gallery, in London, Goya: the Witches and Old Women Album, should dispel the simplistic, saintly image. Here, in 22 rumbustious late drawings, Goya reinflates a standard theme in European art, dating back to the beginning of the witch-hunts – the demonic energy, and lawless creativity, of old crones. They Rise Merrily, an airborne old lady and monk with tambourines, is the only piece which could conceivably be used in a Saga advertisement. And in the autumn, we can marvel at Goya’s smouldering aristocratic and commoner portraits, and wonder what he’s really saying about his often doll-like sitters. I can’t – and can – wait. • Goya: the Witches and Old Women Album opens at the Courtauld, London WC2, on 26 February.

424,2015-01-03T09:17:22Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/03/crystal-palace-appoint-alan-pardew-manager,Alan Pardew keen to restore spirit of his playing days to Crystal Palace,football,Football,The Guardian,"Alan Pardew has said that he wants to restore the spirit of his playing days after taking over as the manager of Crystal Palace. Pardew was released from his Newcastle contract on Saturday morning and signed a three-and-a-half-year contract to return to the club he served for four years as a player. The former midfielder was part of a successful spell in the club’s history between 1987 and 1991, scoring the winner against Liverpool to take them to the 1990 FA Cup final. In an interview broadcast on the club’s website, he said: “I think the fans remember that era I was in, they admired the spirit and they’d probably like to see a bit more of that. Hopefully I can bring that back. “It’s been a while since I played here but it’s somewhere I know well and it’s close to my heart. It was difficult because I’m leaving a big club in Newcastle [but] really and truly, my home is in this area and for me it’s what you would class – as close as you can as a manager – as your own club.” Pardew takes over a side in the Premier League bottom three that has not won for eight matches, since the 3-1 victory over Liverpool at Anfield in November, and he acknowledged results must improve. “It’s a little bit sticky at the moment and we need to find a way out of that. “The players have got great attitudes here, I’ve been very impressed. Can I help change that energy into more tangible results? That might take a transfer, it might take a change of style a little bit and that’s what hopefully a manager of my experience can do.” One target Pardew has been linked with in the January transfer window is the Swansea striker Bafétimbi Gomis and he admitted that there was a need to add to his squad: “Without putting pressure on the chairman – because it’s difficult when the manager keeps talking publicly about players – I think we’re going to need a player or two and that’s what we’re going to try and do.”    Alan Pardew spent four years at Crystal Palace as a player between 1987 and 1991. Photograph: Bob Thomas/Getty Images   Pardew is the permanent successor to Neil Warnock, after Keith Millen took caretaker charge for the goalless draw against Aston Villa, and becomes Palace’s fourth manager in less than 18 months. Warnock succeeded Tony Pulis in the summer, with the former Stoke manager also serving less than a year before walking away in a dispute over transfer targets. Pardew will now be looking to steady the ship and the chairman, Steve Parish, told the club’s website: “We wanted a manager with a great track record and proven experience in the Premier League. In Alan we have both these things as well as a man who has great affection for this club and shares my determination to take us to the next level.” Pardew’s departure from St James’ Park signals the end of an eventful era during which he took the club to fifth place in the Premier League and the quarter-finals of the Europa League but also came in for concerted criticism from some fans. The Newcastle owner, Mike Ashley, remained strongly behind him, though, even after Pardew had been banned from the touchline and fined for butting the Hull midfielder David Meyler in March. Pardew said: “It’s been a privilege to manage Newcastle United and I want to thank my captain, Fabricio Coloccini, and all the players, John Carver, Steve Stone, Andy Woodman and all the staff, all of whom have been outstanding servants to Newcastle United. Special thanks also goes to the fans for all their support over the last four years. I must also thank Mike Ashley and the board for their unwavering support during my tenure at the club.” Carver and Stone led the team in their 1-0 FA Cup defeat at Leicester City as the club embark on a search for a new head coach. That title – as opposed to manager – indicates the club will seek to a recruit a man comfortable with working under a continental model with managing director Lee Charnley and chief scout Graham Carr taking care of recruitment. With Steve Bruce and Tim Sherwood having reportedly been ruled out, Saint-Etienne’s Christophe Galtier and the former Mainz manager Thomas Tuchel have been linked with the club in recent days. However, it is understood that no approaches have yet been made.",,,
425,2015-01-03T09:30:14Z,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jan/03/spit-sawdust-bullseye-how-we-all-learned-to-love-darts,"Spit, sawdust, bullseye! – how we all learned to love darts",sport,Sport,The Guardian,"When the comedian Mel Smith died in 2013, most of the tributes on TV included his famous “darts sketch”, from the 1980s TV satire show Not the Nine O’Clock News. In the sketch Griff Rhys Jones is Dai “Fat Belly” Gutbucket, competing against Smith, as Tommy “Even Fatter Belly” Belcher. Puffing away on cigs, they stand by a table groaning with bottles of booze, the joke being that instead of throwing doubles, they’re downing doubles; brandy, vodka, and so on. Oh how we laughed, the young, savvy, Guardian-reading – there, I’ve said it – audience for that show. But in recent years, darts has become much more than a reliable source of cheap laughs for the chattering classes. Its major events sell out fast (darts historian Patrick Chaplin tells me World Championship tickets were the eighth-quickest seller online this year, not far behind Kate Bush and Fleetwood Mac), while TV audiences approach a million on Sky, and top two million for a rival tournament on the BBC. You might like to think that’s because viewers have lost the taste for feeling superior, that sneering has somehow become unfashionable, but in a TV world where The Only Way is Essex flourishes, a second season of Benefits Street beckons, and Jeremy Kyle’s circus rolls relentlessly on, that can’t be the case. I’ve been looking back at the many pieces I wrote about darts in my 14 years as sport-on-TV columnist for this paper, and it’s clear darts was one of those programmes – like truck racing, strongman contests or Mrs Brown’s Boys – that I watched ironically. Distracted by fat men with inadvisable haircuts, gangs of spectators dressed as penguins, and the late Sid Waddell’s sublimely nonsensical commentary, I somehow failed to give credit to the players for the steely nerve it takes to hit a match-winning double in the rumbustious atmosphere of a packed Alexandra Palace, where the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) World Championships climax this weekend. In a recent TV documentary, Martin Amis, a darts fan of long standing – Keith Talent, a character in Amis’s London Fields is a darts professional, and Amis spent some time hanging around with former world champion Keith Deller for research – described the sport as “elemental, like tiddlywinks in a bearpit”. My view is that, with regular exposure to the sport, the sport-loving public – especially sofa-sprawlers like me – has belatedly come to recognise the truth of my colleague Sean Ingle’s view on darts: “Its pleasures come from its purity. Dart and board, eye and nerve.” And it’s the frequency with which they have to throw the big dart that makes the skill even more admirable. As Stuart Pyke, commentator on darts for 12 years, told me: “They’re always finishing; a leg, a set, or a match. They have to be fully focused every second.” (Roughly every 90 seconds, a double needs to be thrown for some kind of finish.) “You can never relax into a game, and coast,” says Pyke, “If you do that, before you know it, the game will have gone.” It can be heartbreaking – trust me, I sometimes bet on darts – but also thrilling. I know of no other sport where fortunes change in a trice. It’s like a constant penalty shoot-out – the kind of pressure under which our top footballers often go to pieces. And indeed, here is another clue to the growing popularity of darts. For some, it’s blessed relief from the vainglory of Premier League football. As clubs become the playthings of rich owners, and we find ourselves just cheering on a set of shirts, darts brings us chaps we can identify with, sportsmen who don’t need a “community initiative” to mix with the common people, because you might meet them doing their shopping in Asda. Eric Bristow of Stoke Newington, north London, five times world champion and one of the undisputed stars of darts’ first wave of popularity in the late 70s and early 80s, was like that – always approachable, as demonstrated in a cracking documentary, Arrows, from 1979, recently re-run on BBC4. It showed him playing exhibition matches in pubs, and smoking his way through a long, frank radio interview of a kind you would never hear from a star of any other sport.    Eric Bristow, in 1978. Bristow discovered and mentored Phil Taylor, only to be beaten him in a championship semi-final in 1997. Photograph: Peter Johns   Bristow, who later suffered dartitis – like yips in golf, an inability to perform the routine he’d spent a lifetime perfecting – discovered and mentored darts’ greatest-ever player, Phil Taylor, only for Taylor to beat him in a championship semi-final in 1997. For sport as soap opera, you could not better it. Meanwhile the debate over whether darts is a sport or merely a pastime continues. Andy “The Viking” Fordham, former British Darts Organisation champion, who weighed 31 stone at one point, defused it best when asked how he could call himself an athlete. “Sure I’m an athlete,” he responded. “I wear trainers and I’ve been on Grandstand.” Fordham is substantially slimmer these days, and Taylor, 16 times world champion, has been talking about his new-found love of fruit juice. He says he’s been in consultation with “a qualified juice therapist”, and even spent three weeks on a retreat in Portugal with his juicemaster. His favourite, he said, is apple, avocado and ginger. But still the image of Mel Smith with a cushion up his front and a pint in his hand refuses to fade. Not that anyone in the darts world seems too worried. Taylor, I feel, is out on his own with the ginger grater. Certainly Michael Smith and Stephen Bunting, who met in a last-16 match the other night, did not look to me like the sort of chaps guilty of intimacy with either cross-trainer or juice bar. The PDC is one of two championships bestriding the festive season, running from mid-December and culminating in Sunday’s final, after which the British Darts Organisation tournament starts. The BDO was formed in 1973, and according to Chaplin, did fine work in organising tournaments and getting the sport on to TV. But by 1990 ITV had abandoned darts, fearing its “Fat Belly Gutbucket” image too downmarket for its advertisers. The top players found their prize money much diminished, and in 1993, 16 of them set up their own organisation, first called the World Darts Council, later the Professional Darts Corporation, and signed up with Sky TV. Ollie Croft, who runs the BDO from his home in Muswell Hill, north London, banned the “rebels” from BDO tournaments, and has resisted any rapprochement. You can view the split in two ways: either that the “rebels” sold their soul to Sky TV; or that they took a heroic risk, taking matters into their own hands and getting themselves on TV. (It was a risk, says Chaplin: in 1994, the first rebel tournament, there wasn’t enough in the kitty for winner Dennis Priestley’s prize money.) The standard of play in the PDC tends to be a touch higher than at the BDO, and the atmosphere in Ally Pally is certainly more exuberant than at the Lakeside Country Club in Frimley Green. “The PDC has done for darts what the FA did for football in the 1920s and 30s – turned it into a massive spectator sport, more than a participation sport,” says Chaplin. “Barry Hearn has made the championships an event.” (Sports promoter Hearn, who has done similar work with snooker, became chairman of the PDC in 2000.) “You don’t even have to be a darts fan. Bunches of guys – and girls these days – go purely for a good night out.” It’s true. I watched a clip of the 1980 final between Bristow and Bobby George, and there was not a female face to be seen. That’s not the case now. Still, darts is not in immediate danger of winning any diversity awards; not while players are accompanied to the oche by what I suppose we have to call “glamour girls”, and the participants remain predominantly, if not exclusively, white men.    Phil Taylor winning his 7th PDC world darts championship in 1999, beating Phil Manley 6-2. Photograph: John Gichigi/Allsport   Working-class heroes, Waddell called them. It was Waddell, long before he became the voice of the TV coverage, who first brought darts to our screens via Indoor League, which he produced for Yorkshire Television in 1972. It featured skittles, a darts tournament and compere Fred Trueman smoking a pipe and swigging a pint of bitter. “It was a magnificent subculture,” Waddell recalled on Sky TV in 2011. “Big guys with tattoos, who liked a pint and a bet. Leighton Rees from the Valleys, who lived with his mam; Alan Evans, whose dad had a pub, and used to stand him on a box to play at the age of eight. Later there was Keith Deller, whose mum used to fry chips with one hand and throw darts with the other; and Jocky Wilson, who would bring his own optic to tournaments, and a bottle of vodka with his name on it. He’d win darts matches when other people would have been in intensive care.” Nick Hunter, a BBC producer to whom the corporation assigned much of its working-class sports output – rugby league and snooker, as well as darts – was responsible for the next big breakthrough in televised darts, introducing the split screen in 1978. “It was all there at last,” said Waddell. “The agony and the ecstasy. On one side, a closeup of the player’s face; on the other, the board. It was made for TV.” The popularity of darts even spawned a quiz show, Bullseye, which ran from 1981 to 1995, in which darts champs partnered amateurs. It was hosted by comedian Jim Bowen, who always seemed to be showing sheet metal workers or glassblowers how close they had come to winning a new car or a speedboat. “Look at what you could have won,” was his catchphrase, alongside “super, smashing, lovely”. It attracted 17 million viewers, and a host of jokes about council houses with two speedboats in the drive. Even then, it seems, the undervaluing of darts had more to do with class prejudice than anything in the sport itself. It’s a very difficult skill, and arguably demands as much dedication as a sport such as golf if you’re to reach the top. As darts fan Stephen Fry says, “The ability to send tungsten into a small area reliably and consistently is breathtaking.” It really ought to be an Olympic sport. In the meantime, though, Waddell’s working-class heroes seem to be having the last laugh. The PDC championship has a record prize fund this year of just over £1m. For his steady hand and eye, his hours of practice, and a nervelessness unseen outside the field of bomb disposal, tomorrow’s winner will be rewarded with a lot more than a speedboat.",profile/martinkelner,kelner,
426,2015-01-03T10:00:14Z,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/03/curtain-call-anthony-quinn-review,"Curtain Call by Anthony Quinn review – a complex, surprising, pleasing murder mystery",books,Books,The Guardian,"London, 1936. An artist, Stephen Wyley, paints the portrait of a society hostess. His mind is wandering. He worries that he may never be recognised as a serious artist. His new shoes are “pinching with a vehemence he could almost have taken personally”. His subject gushes about Oswald “Tom” Mosley, a name Wyley registers vaguely. Waiting for him on the fourth floor of the Imperial hotel is an actor, Nina Land, who has signed the register with an alias. Kneeling before him, she helps him off with his too-tight shoes, but their assignation is interrupted by cries of terror from the neighbouring room. When Nina knocks on the door she unwittingly saves the life of the latest intended victim of the Tie-pin Killer, a man the papers have eagerly labelled “the new Ripper”. From that moment the plot is driven smartly along by the threat of murder and the many characters of Quinn’s prewar demimonde are inexorably drawn together. If they are too absorbed in their own affairs to take much notice of the urgent reports in the papers – murder, home-grown fascism, the threat of war – Quinn does not judge them for their weaknesses, even if society does. They are unflinchingly but lovingly described, and none more so than the theatre critic Jimmy Erskine. Rude, arrogant, hypochondriac, Erskine is both tyrant and darling. A gay man at a time when homosexuality is a jailable offence, he dismisses the risks with airy defiance and indulges in gaspingly naughty practices. In his group is the gentle Hungarian Jew Laszlo Balatzsovits, a prodigiously talented violist living in squalor. When talking of music Laszlo reveals “a toothy smile like two octaves of a miniature piano”. (In the game of Fantasy Casting, he would surely be played by Peter Lorre.) Surrounded by people, Erskine muses that Laszlo is perhaps “his best … his only friend”. Laszlo cares little for money, nothing for glory – while Erskine adores both. His faults are glaring and familiarity with him reveals still greater failings, but by the time he goes to a drag ball in a full-length Edwardian evening gown and long white gloves with a cigar clamped between his teeth he is unquestionably lovable. The drag ball is a glorious set-piece of comedy and pathos; but Henry James’s description of death as “the distinguished thing” recurs throughout the book. All the characters in Quinn’s novel are complex and surprising and none of them is above suspicion. There is a lot of fun to be had with names and aliases, messages and notes. Thomas Tunner, who cannot tell anyone the truth about himself; Madeleine Farewell, the innocent who is no stranger to vice. The characters themselves talk about their favourite names from Dickens: a clue is dropped here, a mirror held up there. Nina Land, one of three sisters, relates not to a Chekhovian figure but Shakespeare’s King Lear. And Macbeth is everywhere. Quinn employs a battery of literary references for direction and misdirection of the plot or illumination of the dramatis personae – and Curtain Call holds up to the invited scrutiny. There is something of Waugh in the acute observation, of Maugham in the sophistication of the world, a dash of John Buchan in the pace and action, and the comedy is a delight. Neither pastiche nor melodrama, the novel is simply itself. A man takes out a cigar, “dark and stubby as a turd”. Another’s premature ejaculation is described as “getting off a stop too early”. A half-bottle of muscadet goes down “quicker than a homesick mole”. And beneath it all there is clear humanity, as each character pursues their destiny, for better or for worse. Jimmy Erskine observes that Laszlo “had secured … good fortune by virtue of being a kind and deserving person. And that he, in contrast, would never be thought so.” It is a rare moment of self-knowledge. “What is good writing?” asks Erskine in the final pages of Curtain Call. He is, after all, London’s most influential critic. It might be a dangerous question, but there’s no danger here. “We know good writing when we see it, or rather hear it,” he goes on. ‘The essential purpose of writing must be to please.” This book is utterly pleasing from the first page to the last. • Sadie Jones’s latest novel is Fallout (Chatto & Windus). • To order Curtain Call for £9.99 go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.",profile/sadie-jones,jones,sadie

Further, this newest squirrel obstacle course video uses a theme that we all can appreciate: the Grand National Steeplechase at Aintree racecourse. Except, squirrels are plump nut-eating rodents instead of leggy thoroughbred racehorses, so this grand race has been suitably modified and renamed as the Squirrel Grand Nutional.  This fun video provides overstuffed armchair sitters (no railbirds in this crowd!) with a hawk’s-eye view of several of these small hairy beasts as they encounter a number of famous obstacles inspired by those in the Grand National. These obstacles are attached a rope that stretches across Mr Barley’s back garden (now known as Faintree racecourse) and were created from imaginative combinations of scrap wood, green pan scourer-ers and plastic spoons.  Starting in this year’s six-furlong Grand Nutional are three celebrated racing squirrels: the top contender from last year, Lord Greystroke (who, it turns out, was a last-minute scratch), Ninja Nutcase (wearing black and red colours), and Lady Bobtail (wearing pink and black colours). In this video, these racing squirrels face five famous and imposing fences, including The Chair, Canal Turn, the Water Jump and of course, one of the most challenging fences in the entire race, Creecher’s Brook.

A dreadful 12 months for olives in several major producing countries has led to 2014 being labelled the “black year” for the industry and to the doubling of the bulk cost of olive oil in some areas. Unusual weather and a proliferation of insects and bacterial blight have devastated the harvest in several countries. Analysts have been predicting a bad year for olive oil since the summer, after it became clear that hot late spring weather in Spain – the world’s largest producer of olives – was going to have a key impact on autumn harvests. Other producers have been coming in with equally poor results, adding to the woes of the industry Europe-wide. Farmers in Italy have suffered so badly from pests and adverse weather that many are reporting harvests 40% to 50% down on 2013. Unusually large flocks of starlings have been reported as further destroying the fruits in parts of southern Italy, leading to calls for a cull. “This is the worst year in memory,” said Pietro Sandali, head of the Italian olive growers consortium, Unaprol. In Greece, the olive output has been more stable, but the other smaller producing countries cannot pick up the strain: Morocco and Tunisia have also suffered bad weather, while Syria, which claims to be the birthplace of the olive tree and which has 74 million trees, has been affected by the civil war. The International Olive Council (IOC) says production will hit its lowest level in 15 years and admits there will be an upswing in prices; its latest figures show the price from the producers had risen by 121% in the last month of 2014 compared with December 2013, with supply down by almost a third. That increase, the experts say, is likely to be passed on at the supermarkets, meaning a bottle of olive oil is likely to cost British shoppers more than a high-end bottle of wine. Ever since the first bulbs of garlic began to appear in British kitchens in the 1970s, the Mediterranean diet has been so wholeheartedly adopted here that its ingredients have become commonplace. Now a price hike in a bottle of olive oil could make a luxury out of a staple. The Italian Olive Oil Company in Hever, Kent, says it is already warning customers that its supplies will be limited. Olive farmers with low harvests are inclined to go for quantity over quality and do fewer of the initial virgin pressings so beloved of foodies in Britain. But worst hit will be the farmers and the economies of the olive oil-producing countries, all of which are still struggling to emerge from several years of dire economic straits. The olive oil industry is worth more than £2bn to southern European producers. Curtis Cord, publisher of the Olive Oil Times, has called the situation “particularly painful”, adding that millions of people rely on the industry in Spain, Italy, Greece, Portugal, Morocco and Tunisia. “This has a profound, profound effect on families and producers in these regions, so it is a crisis,” he said. “That’s one of the unfortunate parts of producing olives and olive oil. It’s cyclical: you’re going to have bad years and good years.” Spain and Italy account for just under 70% of output, and the Madrid-based IOC, which publishes benchmark supply and demand estimates, forecasts that Spanish olive oil production will more than halve next year, to 825,700 tonnes. Production in Italy is expected to fall about a third to 302,500 tonnes, the lowest level since 1991. Olive oil comes in so many different types and qualities of pressings that it is difficult to compare prices, but broadly it varies from around £4 a litre in Aldi to £6.50 at Waitrose. However, Europe, where two-thirds of the world’s olive oil supply is consumed, will have cheaper alternatives. Favourable weather elsewhere in the world has meant that harvests of oilseed crops have been plentiful and prices have been falling. The future could also see olive oil coming from the US, where more and more landowners in the increasingly climatically challenged states of California and Texas are planting olive trees. To add insult to culinary injury for Britain’s salad lovers, the drought in Spain is also likely to see fewer tomatoes and lettuces available to us.",profile/tracymcveigh,Tracy ,McVeigh

The accusation against the Duke of York is contained in a motion filed in a Florida court this week in connection with a long-running lawsuit brought by women who say they were exploited by Jeffrey Epstein, a multi-millionaire convicted of soliciting sex with an underage girl after a plea deal.    Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein in New York. Photograph: Jae Donnelly/News Syndication   The woman, who filed the motion anonymously, alleges that between 1999 and 2002 she was repeatedly sexually abused by Epstein who, she also alleges, loaned her out to rich and influential men around the world. The document – a motion to expand an ongoing lawsuit relating to prosecutors’ handling of Epstein’s case with two new plaintiffs – alleges that the woman “was forced to have sexual relations with this prince when she was a minor” in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein.    Jeffrey Epstein. Photograph: Sipa Press/Rex   The prince is not a named party to the legal claim, which is directed against federal prosecutors. He has not had any opportunity to respond to the allegations in the legal claim. The woman is said to have been 17 at the time, considered to be a minor in Florida. In a 2011 Vanity Fair article, Prince Andrew denied any sexual contact with young women associated with Epstein. Contacted on Thursday, Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the allegations contained in the court document. A palace spokesperson said the royal household would “never comment on an ongoing legal matter”. However following publication of this article on theguardian.com, Buckingham Palace issued the following statement: “This relates to long-running and ongoing civil proceedings in the United States to which the Duke of York is not a party. As such we would not comment in detail. However, for the avoidance of doubt, any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.” Another close associate of Epstein who is also accused in the lawsuit, Alan Dershowitz, told the Guardian that the woman’s accusations against himself were “totally false and made up”. The Harvard law professor and esteemed criminal defence attorney who later advised Epstein on how to respond to the FBI’s investigation is accused in the court motion of having sexual relations with the woman when she was a minor and of witnessing the abuse of other minors. On Thursday he told the Guardian: “There is no more strenuous denial than the one I am giving. I never met her. I don’t know her. I have never had sex with an underage person.” He added: “This person has made this up out of cloth, maliciously and knowingly in order to extort money from Mr Epstein.” Dershowitz, who has occasionally written op-ed articles for the Guardian, said he could not comment on the woman’s allegations against Prince Andrew or any other men, but he said her claims against him were demonstrably false and challenged her to file criminal charges against him. “It is a totally fabricated charge in every possible way,” he said. “It just never happened.” He said he was considering taking legal action to have Brad Edwards and Paul Cassell, the lawyers who filed the motion, disbarred for “knowingly filing … a false, malicious and defamatory statement in a lawsuit”. Edwards said: “We have been informed of Mr Dershowitz’s threats of legal action and bar proceedings … we carefully investigate all of the allegations in our pleadings before presenting them.” In a statement to the Guardian through her lawyers, the woman behind the allegations said she was being “unjustly victimised again”. “These types of aggressive attacks on me are exactly the reason why sexual abuse victims typically remain silent and the reason why I did for a long time,” she said. “That trend should change. I’m not going to be bullied back into silence.” The Guardian is aware of the identity of the plaintiff behind the allegations, but is respecting her wish to bring the case anonymously. Andrew’s close relationship with Epstein – he visited him in New York two years after the American’s release from prison in 2009 – has long been a source of controversy. The Daily Mail reported in 2011 that the prince had broken off contact with the banker. The duke had previously been accused of meeting Epstein’s young victims and possibly being aware of their sexual exploitation. However, this is the first time he has been named in a court document as a participant in any sexual activity with one of the young women allegedly trafficked by Epstein. As the claim has only just been lodged, and as the duke is not a named party to it, he has not had the opportunity to formally file a defence or denial to the claims. In 2006, the FBI opened an investigation into allegations that Epstein had been paying for sex with underage girls at his Palm Beach mansion for years. By the following year federal prosecutors said they had identified 40 young women who may have been illegally procured by Epstein. In 2008, however, the federal inquiry was dropped after Epstein negotiated a deal with prosecutors in which he agreed to plead guilty to a relatively minor state charge relating to soliciting paid sex with a minor – a 14-year-old girl. He served 13 months of an 18-month sentence and is now a registered sex offender. Many of his alleged victims have since reached out-of-court settlements with Epstein, who was once considered among the wealthiest investment bankers in the world. However, two of Epstein’s alleged victims, referred to in court documents as Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2, have brought a lawsuit arguing that federal prosecutors violated a victims’ rights statute by failing to consult them over Epstein’s secret deal. The pair won a significant legal victory in July last year entitling them to see previously confidential documents from the plea bargain discussions between Epstein’s lawyers and federal prosecutors. The court document filed this week containing allegations against Andrew is a motion to allow two more alleged Epstein victims, referred to as Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4, to join the action. Jane Doe 3 – the woman who made the accusations against Andrew – claims her contact with Epstein began when she was approached at the age of 15 by Ghislaine Maxwell, the daughter of the late media mogul Robert Maxwell and a close friend of Epstein. The motion alleges that Maxwell “was one of the main women whom Epstein used to procure under-aged girls for sexual activities”. With Maxwell’s assistance, the document alleges, Epstein converted the girl into a “sex slave”, repeatedly abusing her in his private jet or his lavish residences in New York, New Mexico, Florida and the US Virgin Islands. “Epstein also sexually trafficked the then-minor Jane Doe, making her available for sex to politically connected and financially powerful people,” the court document alleges. “Epstein’s purposes in ‘lending’ Jane Doe (along with other young girls) to such powerful people were to ingratiate himself with them for business, personal, political, and financial gain, as well as to obtain potential blackmail information.” The motion alleges that Maxwell was “a primary co-conspirator in his sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme” and that she also participated in the abuse. The document goes on to allege: “Perhaps even more important to her role in Epstein’s sexual abuse ring, Maxwell had direct connections to other powerful individuals with whom she could connect Epstein. For instance, one such powerful individual Epstein forced Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with was a member of the British royal family, Prince Andrew (aka Duke of York).” The document lists three locations where the woman alleges she was forced to have sexual relations with Andrew: Maxwell’s London apartment, Epstein’s private Caribbean island in what was allegedly “an orgy with numerous other under-aged girls”, and an undisclosed location in New York. Requests made to representatives of Ghislaine Maxwell for comment had not been returned at the time of publication, but she has previously strenuously denied any involvement in procuring young girls for Epstein or any of his associates. In 2011 a spokesperson for Maxwell said she had never been contacted by any law enforcement agency in connection with the allegations.  However a statement issued on behalf of Maxwell after the Guardian published details of the lawsuit on Friday said the claims were “not new and have been fully responded to and shown to be untrue”. It added: “Ghislaine Maxwell’s original response to the lies and defamatory claims remains the same.” The new motion alleges that Epstein instructed the girl “to give the prince whatever he demanded” and also instructed her to “report back on the details of the sexual abuse”. The woman’s lawyers allege in their motion that, in addition to facilitating her alleged encounters with the prince and Dershowitz, Epstein trafficked her to “many other powerful men, including numerous prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well-known prime minister, and other world leaders”.",profile/paullewis,Paul,Lewis
430,2015-01-03T11:00:15Z,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/03/depression-doesnt-make-you-sad-all-the-time,Depression doesn’t make you sad all the time,commentisfree,Opinion,The Guardian,"One of the most popular, enduring, and irritating myths about depression is that it means depressed people are sad all the time – and that by extension, people who are happy can’t be experiencing depression, even if they say they are. It is a skewed and horrible version of depression, and it’s one that further stigmatises the condition and isolates people with depression and related mental health conditions. This is because, put bluntly, depression doesn’t make you sad all the time – though the level of sadness a patient experiences can of course vary depending on the individual and the severity of depression. When I’m having a depressive episode, I’m not walking around in tattered black clothes, weeping and wailing. I go out with friends. I crack jokes (especially sardonic ones). I keep working, and have friendly chats with the people I work with. I often manage to feed and clothe myself, I read books. Above all, I experience moments of happiness: a flash of delight as I’m walking on the beach with a friend and the sun is perfect and the breeze is just right; a surge somewhere deep inside when I’m surrounded by beautiful trees and it’s raining and I feel my heart swelling to encompass the whole world; a warm, friendly, affectionate sensation at the touch of a friend, a hug at the end of an evening or a hand placed over mine as we lean forward to see something better. Yet I feel a strange conflicting pressure. On the one hand, I feel like I need to engage in a sort of relentless performative sadness to be taken seriously, for people to understand that I really am depressed and that each day – each moment of each day – is a struggle for me, that even when I am happy, I am still fighting the monster. I feel like I need to darken everything around me, to stop communicating with the world, to stop publishing anything, to just stop. Because that way I will appear suitably, certifiably sad, and thus, depressed – and then maybe people will recognise that I’m depressed and perhaps they’ll even offer support and assistance. The jokes die in my throat, the smile never reaches my lips, I don’t share that moment of happiness on the beach by turning to my friend and expressing joy. I don’t, in other words, do the things that can help ameliorate depression, encourage people to reach out, and help depressed people with functioning, completing daily tasks of life, and finding a reason to live again. I don’t find and build a rich community of people who can offer support (and whom I can support in turn), because I have to be so wrapped up in performing my sadness at all times to prove that I’m depressed enough – even as I want to scream that this is a reinforcement of stereotypes that hurt people, that by doing this I am hurting not just myself but others. On the other, I feel an extreme pressure to perform just the opposite, because sad depressed people are boring and no fun, as I am continually reminded every time I speak openly about depression or express feelings of sadness and frustration. I’m caught in a trap where if I don’t perform sadness, I’m not really depressed, but if I express sadness at all to any degree, I’m annoying and boring and should stop being so self-centred. Thus I’m effectively pushed into fronting, putting a face on it even when I am depressed and deeply sad – when I feel like I am choking on my own misery, I put up a cheeky Tweet. When I hate myself and I want to die, I post a link to something fun, or I write up something silly to run somewhere – even though as I write it, I am drawn deeper and deeper into my unhappiness. Depression is an asshole, and it can become your master, but you can slip out from under it occasionally. And many depressed people in the midst of an episode don’t actually spend it fainting dramatically on the couch and talking about how miserable they are. Some are high-functioning (bolstered by the need to put a face on it), others are into morbid jokes, others try to reach out for help (isn’t that what we’re “supposed” to do?) from friends and try to make their depression less scary. Depression isn’t an all-or-nothing deal – seeing a person who identifies with depression cracking a joke or having fun or dancing with a friend isn’t evidence that the person is faking it, whether the person is experiencing a moment of genuine happiness, or fronting. Conversely, jollying up people with depression to demand that they start being more fun is equally revolting, a refusal to acknowledge that people experiencing a rough day, or a rough week, or a rough few hours aren’t going to be your trained monkeys. Depression manifests differently in everyone and at different times. Various behaviours are not proof positive that someone is or isn’t depressed, and, as with any armchair diagnosis, insisting that someone is not actually depressed just because of a show of something other than deep, entrenched sadness is actively harmful. Look at the woman above, joyously cycling on a beach, hair fluttering in the breeze. You can’t judge her emotional state or her larger mental health picture, nor should you. • This article was originally published on This Ain’t Livin’, part of the Guardian Comment Network",profile/s-e-smith,s.e.,smith
431,2015-01-03T11:00:33Z,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/03/israel-avigdor-lieberman-poll-meltdown-corruption-probe,Israel’s Avigdor Lieberman faces poll meltdown after party corruption probe,world,World news,The Guardian,"When Israel’s hawkish rightwing foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, addressed New York’s Russian-Jewish community last April, he focused on the political success of Russian immigrants like him in Israel. “Only in Israel,” Lieberman ventured, “can a young Russian immigrant arrive and in 20 years become foreign minister. One day we will have a Russian-speaking minister of defence, a Russian-speaking president, and soon, we may have a Russian-speaking prime minister.” Few doubted that he meant himself. Today, however, his political fortunes appear to be in sharp decline after his party, Yisrael Beiteinu, became embroiled in a far-reaching corruption investigation. The former nightclub bouncer from Moldova has also fallen out with his erstwhile ally, prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu, with whose Likud party he briefly merged Yisrael Beiteinu at the last elections. Running on a joint list in 2013, the two parties won 31 seats. These days polls suggest Lieberman’s party would be lucky to win more than a handful. There is also evidence that the million-strong core of Russian-speaking voters in Israel are abandoning his party. Parties in Israel’s political system – particularly those closely identified with individuals – tend to come and go. But Lieberman’s woes threaten to affect the outcome of the snap elections called for 17 March . Alongside Netanyahu, Lieberman has been one of the key faces of Israel’s international diplomacy. He derided efforts by the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, to win support for statehood at the UN as “diplomatic terrorism” and has called for Israel’s sizable Arab minority to be made to swear a loyalty oath to the state. Lieberman’s other big idea – his own variant of the two-state solution – is no less controversial: he envisages the transfer of Israeli-Arab towns into a new Palestinian state.    Israel’s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, whose Likud party would benefit from a drift of votes away from Yisrael Beiteinu. Photograph: Amir Cohen/Reuters   Critics, such as former president Shimon Peres, have described that plan as discriminatory and impractical. “Israel cannot take away its citizens’ citizenship simply because they’re Arab,” Peres said. Last year Lieberman was also criticised for urging Israelis, via his Facebook page, to boycott Israeli-Arab businesses that went on strike in sympathy with Gaza. Lieberman’s fate matters because under Israel’s electoral system the president first invites the party with the largest number of seats to try to form a coalition. With Netanyahu’s rightwing Likud party polling neck and neck with – or a few seats behind – a new party representing a joint slate of Labour’s Isaac Herzog and former justice minister Tzipi Livni, votes lost by Lieberman would, most analysts believe, drift towards Likud. At the centre of Lieberman’s problems is a police investigation into his party and its contacts in which 30 people have been arrested, including one of Lieberman’s close confidants, Moshe Lion, although Lieberman has not been personally implicated. It is claimed that figures allegedly associated with Lieberman’s party – including some in government ministries, NGOs, local councils, clubs and state bodies – funnelled kickbacks for personal and political advantage. Lieberman, who has been investigated and cleared of corruption in the past, says the investigation is politically motivated. Launching his election campaign last week in the occupied West Bank settlement of Ariel, Lieberman, who lives in the more southerly settlement of Nokdim, said: “Had the current affair broken the day before elections were called, or two days after the end of the election campaign, I’d have understood. But the fact that it was declared two weeks after the disbanding of the Knesset is strange to me – and that’s an understatement. And I would like to believe that this is not connected to the elections and is entirely coincidental. But how can I believe that when I have encountered this coincidence for the sixth time?” That claim was denied forcefully last Thursday by Israel’s attorney general, Yehuda Weinstein, who insisted that the investigation had been in place long before the elections were announced. Whatever the truth, it is clear that the allegations are damaging to Lieberman’s party at a time when it has been struggling to appeal to a younger generation of more integrated Russian-speaking voters. “The party is going through a massive earthquake,” Avraham Diskin, a political scientist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said last week. “It’s clear that it is in very big danger.” Gideon Rahat, a political scientist at the Hebrew University, points out that Lieberman’s party, which was founded in 1999, has struggled to prosper of late in an overcrowded Israeli right, where he has been seen as tacking in the wrong direction. Rahat does not believe that the investigation is politically motivated, but argues that Lieberman has “survived” previous crises where he has personally come under investigation. He was forced to step down temporarily as foreign minister over claims (of which he was cleared) that he had tried to advance the career of a former diplomat who relayed information to him about a criminal investigation into his business dealings. Rahat believes a more important issue for Lieberman is whether he will still be interested in staying in politics if his trajectory is stalled or in a sharp decline. “His party was small in 2003. He did well out of his alliance with Likud in 2013 and succeeded to win a lot of seats with them. He can survive if he is willing to relinquish some power.”    Avigdor Lieberman addresses the media in Jerusalem last month. Photograph: Xinhua News Agency/Rex   That appears to be the crucial question. Lieberman’s party, Rahat points out, is little more than a vehicle for his political personality, with key decisions made by him. “The question is whether he would be satisfied now leading a small- to medium-size party.” Of late, it has appeared that Lieberman had been trying to reposition himself and his party away from the further reaches of the right. This would allow him, say some commentators, to join a coalition with whatever bloc came top in the elections. That may be damaging Lieberman the most in his constituency. Nadav Haetzni, writing in the Maariv daily newspaper, said: “Even before the troubles brought upon [Yisrael Beiteinu] by the police investigation, it had lost most of the Russian electorate that created and upheld it. At the same time, the rightwing idealist voter, who had once voted for Lieberman, has become clever and wised-up and gone to [Naftali] Bennett’s [Jewish Home]. Now under investigation, this party is also on the way to collapse, as the Russian sectarianism will fade together with it as well.”",profile/peterbeaumont,Peter,Beaumont

Two men died at different addresses within hours of each other on New Year’s Day after taking what police believe were ecstasy pills made with a high concentration of the chemical PMMA instead of MDMA, usually the main component of ecstasy. A third man who was taken to hospital in a serious condition after being discovered at the same address as one of the dead men. Police believe those cases may be linked to the death of another man in Ipswich on Christmas Eve. Police say all the men were in their 20s. West Mercia police believe a 27-year-old man, named locally as Daniel Bagnall, who was found dead at a property in Ketley, Telford on New Year’s Day may also have taken the drug. Suffolk police have offered a temporary drug amnesty to anyone who surrenders the red or pink tablets of ecstasy, inscribed with a Superman-style “S” in their centre. Police have given five locations where the tablets can be handed in. Police say they are not offering a general drug amnesty but the ecstasy tablets, thought to be to blame for the four deaths and one hospital admission, are “potentially so dangerous we need to remove them from the streets to prevent further deaths”. Supt Louisa Pepper of Suffolk police said: “Please don’t be worried about any sort of prosecution because we genuinely just want the drugs off the streets. We view this particular drug as especially dangerous and want to prevent further deaths and save lives.” Last night the Suffolk force said it had arrested three men, aged 19, 20 and 26, all from Ipswich, on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of controlled drugs. The death in Telford on Friday follows the deaths of two young men in Suffolk within hours of each other on Thursday morning, with another admitted to hospital in a serious condition. Gediminas Kulokas, a Lithuanian labourer, died on New Year’s Day – his 24th birthday – after collapsing at his Ipswich home. Kulokas’s 22-year-old friend Donatas was admitted to hospital at the same time in a serious condition after taking the same drug. Kulokas died less than three hours after 20-year-old John Hocking, also a labourer, died in nearby Rendlesham, near Woodbridge.    Victim John Hocking, a 20-year-old labourer. Photograph: Photograph   The first victim of the rogue batch of drugs is thought to be a Lithuanian factory worker, Eustace Ropas, 22, who died on Christmas Eve at his home, also in Ipswich. Natasha Mumby, Kulokas’s partner, has described how she desperately tried to resuscitate him after he stopped breathing. “We were at the flat having a few quiet drinks to celebrate New Year’s Eve and his birthday in the early hours,” she said. “I went to bed at 2 am and woke up a few times because he and his friend were making a bit of noise. I had no idea that they had been taking drugs. “Every time I got up to tell them to keep quiet, they were looking the worse for wear. His friend popped out and when I checked on Gediminas, he was breathing in a funny way. I propped him up and went back to bed,” she said. “I then came back in the lounge because he was not making the breathing noise any more. He was just sitting there not breathing.” Police believe the drug taken by all five men could have a similar chemical mix to dangerous ecstasy pills with a similar appearance that were in circulation in the Netherlands last month. In December, the Dutch Trimbos drug addiction clinic issued a warning about the pills, which have a high concentration of PMMA instead of MDMA, which is the usual main drug in ecstasy pills. PMMA is dangerous because the chemical takes longer to work than MDMA. The delay can cause users who do not know they have taken a different variety of ecstasy to overdose because they think their first pills have not worked. Dutch media reported on at least two PMMA-related deaths in the Netherlands in 2013.    An ecstasy pill of the kind police believe may be linked to one man’s death in Telford and three in Suffolk. Photograph: Suffolk police/PA   Both drugs are stimulants, causing an energy boost and feelings of affection for other people, but PMMA is far more toxic, with an overdose of just 50mg having potentially fatal consequences. Harry Shapiro, director of communications at the charity Drugscope, said a possible explanation for the increased use of PMMA and the closely related chemical PMA in ecstasy was a crackdown in Cambodia on the production of safrole, a key ingredient in MDMA production, causing drug manufacturers to turn to other ingredients. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show there were no deaths from PMA or PMMA in 2009 or 2010, but this jumped to 20 in 2012. By 2013, there were 29 deaths connected to the drugs. The Irish drugs website Drugs.ie says between December 2013 and May last year, six people in Ireland were found to have had PMMA in their systems when they died. In 2011 the Scottish Drug and Crime Enforcement Agency released a warning about PMMA after a spate of deaths. It was also believed to be the cause of a series of deaths across Europe at around the same time. Speaking at the time, Det Insp Tommy Crombie, drugs co-ordinator at the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland, warned: “PMMA and other harmful substances could be present in many illicit drugs including powders, products sold as legal highs and ecstasy tablets in all sorts of colours and with all sorts of logos. “Like all illicit drugs, there is no way to tell what’s in them until it’s too late.” • This article was amended on 7 January 2015 to update police advice on handing in ecstasy tablets under a temporary amnesty.",profile/ameliahill,Amelia,Hill

Abu Anas al-Liby, 50, died on Friday from complications following liver surgery, his wife said. He had a $5m (£3.3m) bounty on his head and was high on the FBI’s most-wanted list when he was captured by US forces in Tripoli in October 2013. He and a Saudi businessman Khalid al-Fawwaz were due to stand trial on 12 January over the attacks, in which 244 people were killed and more than 5,000 wounded. His wife, Um Abdullah, accused the US government of “kidnapping, mistreating, and killing an innocent man”, according to Associated Press. She said that Liby’s experiences had made his illnesses, including hepatitis C, worse and that had contributed to his death. He was also reported to have had advanced liver cancer. Liby had previously pleaded not guilty to conspiracy charges in relation to the 1998 attacks. A third suspect, the Egyptian Adel Abdel Bary, pleaded guilty last year to playing a role in the bombings. In December 2013, Bernard Kleinman, a lawyer for Liby, said his client was only accused of participating in visual and photographic surveillance of the US embassy in Nairobi in late 1993, and researching potential sites for other attacks with members of al-Qaida in 1994. Liby is believed to have been an early associate of Osama bin Laden, and is thought to have been granted asylum in Britain in 1995. Scotland Yard arrested him four years later but police were forced to release him for lack of evidence. When officers later raided his home, they found terrorist training material, dubbed the Manchester manual. Liby, however, had already fled the country. He was indicted by a New York grand jury in 2000 for the 1998 attacks.",profile/dominic-smith,smith,dominic

Manjoo said that the incident was similar to the way Bangladesh blocked her from visiting a notorious refugee camp and India stopped her investigating state-run detention facilities. Manjoo said she hoped that other countries would raise the issue with the UK government of why she was not allowed to enter Britain’s largest immigration centre for women, questioning if there was “something to hide”. During her two-week tour of Britain in April, organised by senior Home Office officials, Manjoo heard a series of allegations over the plight of female detainees inside Yarl’s Wood, including allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour and privacy issues, but was not allowed to inspect the facility at the end of her official visit. Manjoo said the decision would be raised in the final draft of her report documenting Britain’s approach to violence against womenin the same way she raised concerns following similarly restrictive moves by the Bangladeshi and Indian governments. In May 2013 Manjoo was prevented from entering Bangladesh’s Kutupalong refugee camp, which houses members of the Rohingya community in the south-east of the country. Manjoo had received reports of “human rights violations, including violence against women” inside the Bangladeshi camps. Speaking from Johannesburg, Manjoo said: “If you look at my Bangladeshi report, I was denied entry to a refugee camp and I have made a note in my report, in the same way I will put in the UK report that I was denied entry to Yarl’s Wood.” Days before arriving in the UK last year, Manjoo published her investigation into India, which states: “The special rapporteur regrets that, despite her specific requests prior to and during the mission, no visits to state-run shelters, prisons or detention centres were programmed.” She said the failure to allow her to inspect Yarl’s Wood meant the concerns of the detainees had been suppressed. “It’s a missed opportunity, let’s put it that way, to have a dialogue on conditions in such detention centres where there are all sorts of constraints in terms of disclosure, including the possibility of victimisation,” she said. “More importantly for people facing the threat of deportation, it’s in their interests to talk about this.” Manjoo added: “I can’t speculate on the state’s reasons since I wasn’t giving access to discuss the issue. Whether there is something to hide, whether there’s a denial or whether there’s a lack of accountability I wouldn’t be able to comment, because I didn’t go.” Her draft report is understood to have been submitted to the UK last month and contains recommendations to help tackle sexism and misogyny. Next month a parliamentary inquiry is expected to publish a critical report on immigration detention, followed by another report questioning the behaviour of some male guards inside Yarl’s Wood.",profile/marktownsend,Mark ,Townsend

This Australian’s obsession is particularly niche: she loves making paper-cutout animations, kind of like a pop-up book in sketchpad form. These form a big part of her stage act, allied to a barrage of deliberately silly gags and an infectiously positive attitude. Ellipsis is inspired by an awestruck encounter with New Adventures Of Superman star Dean Cain (see what we mean about her being a geek), which led Hill to a hubristic pledge: come what may, she was going to come up with an award-winning show. It’s not the most appealing prospect for an evening’s entertainment (does anyone care about comedy awards as much as comedians?), but Hill manages to turn it into a daffy and ultimately uplifting hour. Upstairs, Soho Theatre, W1, Tue to 10 Jan  Gein’s Family Giftshop: Volume 1, On tour Sketch trio Gein’s Family Giftshop are proud of their north-west roots, and they certainly provide a brand of comedy far removed from the off-the-peg sub-Mitchell and Webb conceptualism peddled by many of their southern counterparts. Theirs is a dark and sinister comic world, peopled by misfits and frequently erupting in explosions of gore. You can see all sorts of interesting influences at work here – there’s a strong debt to Chris Morris’s Blue Jam, as well as a dash of Limmy, and a sprinkling of The League Of Gentlemen in the Giftshop’s genetic makeup. But rather than slavishly homaging their heroes, Kath Hughes, Ed Easton and James Meehan (plus non-performing member Kiri Pritchard-McLean) conjure something that feels very now. You may need a strong stomach to cope with some of their ideas but, given that they take their name from a murderer who skinned corpses to make a suit, you can’t say you haven’t been warned. Various venues Tony Law: Enter The Tonezone, London For years, Tony Law has trafficked in a particularly free-wheeling form of surrealistic whimsy. Dressed erratically, he bellows non sequiturs at his audience, seemingly free of rhyme or reason. Enter The Tonezone sees more of this glorious stuff, but it’s accessorised this time by a newly introspective air. Following the death of his beloved dog last year, Law’s mind has become increasingly preoccupied by mortality, and this sensibility provides an unexpected undercurrent to the usual wild careering. It’s easy to turn armchair psychologist and suggest this kind of bleakness lies at the heart of any surrealist comic, with the absurdities they pile up reflecting a fundamental belief that life is pointless. But such philosophising shouldn’t distract us from noticing that Law is better than ever in this new show: indeed he’s getting funnier with every passing year.

436,2015-01-03T12:00:17Z,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/03/ben-lerner-1004-novel-books-interview,"Ben Lerner: ‘People say, “Oh, here’s another Brooklyn novel by a guy with glasses”’",books,Books,The Guardian,"Some years ago, after eating one at a Japanese restaurant, the poet and novelist Ben Lerner became interested in the sensory life of the octopus. He went on the internet, where he learned that the cephalopod’s neurons are evenly distributed, and that as a result the octopus can taste anything it touches. As a downside of this nervous condition, the octopus has a poor concept of its overall position in space. The word for what the octopus lacks is “proprioception”: the unconscious sense by which a being monitors the position of its limbs. In Lerner’s new novel, 10:04, the word appears many times. It’s a literary homage (the poet Charles Olson wrote an essay about the term) but also a refrain about the poor perceptual relationship of the individual to the social body. As Lerner writes, of the octopus, and of his narrator, who is also named Ben: the octopus “can detect local texture variations, but cannot integrate that information into a larger picture, cannot read the realistic fiction the world appears to be”. 10:04 is a novel that considers global trade, social inequality, ecological catastrophe, the limitations of a human’s reproductive lifespan, and the passage and accumulation of time (the title references the moment the lightning strikes the clock tower in Back to the Future). But 10:04 only approaches such difficult problems through a detailed description of the “local texture variations” of New York City in the years between tropical storm Irene, in August 2011, and hurricane Sandy, in October 2013. In Lerner’s novel this New York is one of extreme luxury – a place where a baby octopus is imported from Portugal and then delicately massaged to death and served for lunch – but also constant insecurity, with a clear sense of an untenably unequal society. Lerner’s characters both enjoy their access to obscure consumer goods and resort to living on unemployment cheques. They await a collapse of their empire – expecting, either during a hurricane or Occupy Wall Street, a toppling of the social order – but somehow the moment never seems to arrive. As they wait, they go to museums. I met Lerner at the Brooklyn Museum of Art on a rainy afternoon in early December. He lives nearby and visits it often with his young daughter. Museums are frequent settings in Lerner’s writing. His first novel, Leaving the Atocha Station, begins with a scene in the Prado in Madrid. A man stands in tears before Rogier van der Weyden’s The Descent From the Cross. Is the man grieving, wonders Adam Gordon, the book’s narrator, or is he having “a profound experience of art”? The question is a joke about how much of art is dissimulation; Adam, a poet, feels like a fraud. He and his friends wait to experience something “real” to write about. He tends to enjoy poetry more when its lines are embedded in works of prose. “Insofar as I was interested in the arts I was interested in the disconnect between my experience of actual artworks and the claims made on their behalf,” Adam says. Lerner describes his first novel, a satire of the poetry world and serious young men, as “accidental”. By the time of its publication, when he was 32, he was already a successful poet, with three published collections, a nomination for the National Book Award for poetry, and a teaching job at Brooklyn College. He was tired of writing in lines, however, and tired of academic criticism too. He began to put some of the ideas from his third book of poems and from an academic paper about John Ashbery into what he initially thought of as a first-person essay but later turned out to be Leaving the Atocha Station. Lerner describes the narrator of that book as “a neurotic version of my already quite neurotic self”. Adam Gordon mirrors Lerner in key respects – he is a poet on a fellowship in Spain, and Lerner spent a year in Spain on a Fulbright grant to study poetry; both he and his narrator are from Topeka, Kansas – but Gordon is a dissimulator, who shirks responsibilities and tells petty lies to elicit sympathy. Writing in the New Yorker, the critic James Wood described Adam as “a creature of privilege and lassitude, living through a time of inflamed political certainty, yet certain only of his own uncertainty”. The novel, published by an independent non-profit press in the US, received critical praise, but Lerner’s sudden transition to prose fiction worried some of his fellow poets. “Poets really haven’t gotten the news that the novel is also dead,” he says, of the opinion among some poets that writing in prose is a capitulation to market forces. Still, the poets tolerated a single attempt – even Ashbery wrote a novel. “It’s like some weird homeopathic myth, that you avoid the novel but you are allowed to write one,” Lerner says. “You can write one novel in your life as a poet.”    The title 10:04 references the moment the lightning strikes the clock tower in Back to the Future. Photograph: PR   Afterwards, Lerner began work on a long poem. Then he wrote some essays, some art criticism and a short story. A frame started to grow around them, and that frame became 10:04. “I decided to write more fiction – something I’d promised my poet friends I wasn’t going to do,” says the main character in his book. Like Leaving the Atocha Station, 10:04 has an early scene in a museum. Lerner’s 33-year-old narrator stands in front of Jules Bastien-Lepage’s Joan of Arc at New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art. He gazes at the painting alongside his best friend, a woman named Alex. The narrator here could be seen as a continuation of Adam Gordon: he is a poet who has recently published his first novel; he is also from Topeka; he is a few years older. But for Lerner the parallel gazes mark “Ben” as different – he is far more aware of the concerns of others around him. As they stand side-by-side before the painting, Alex breaks the silence: “I’m 36 and single,” she says, “apropos of nothing.” Then she asks Ben if he will donate his sperm to her so she can have a child. He agrees. The close platonic friendship between Alex and Ben has no precedent that I can think of in recent fiction, despite the prevalence of such relationships in the world around me. If the question put by Nora Ephron in the 1980s was “Can men and women be friends?”, the question today might be “Why can’t men and women who are friends just marry each other and start families?” It’s not that Alex and Ben are suppressing the question of sex, it’s that, for all their intimacy, they don’t love each other in that way (eventually, to see if it can hasten the pregnancy, they try having sex – “a passion I did not feel, but which rose within me as I faked it”). Now, due to the time limitations of reproductive biology, such friends must confront the problem of producing a family outside the structure of a monogamous relationship. Lerner himself has been married for eight years. His wife, Ariana Mangual, is a professor of education at Rutgers University. Her name appears twice in 10:04, but she does not figure as a character. Despite the traditional structure of his own nuclear family (Mangual was pregnant with their daughter during much of the time he was writing the book), Lerner wanted 10:04 to address the expanded spectrum of domestic arrangements.    In the 1980s Nora Ephron asked whether women and men could be friends, a topic Lerner explores. Photograph: Linda Nylind/Guardian   ‘The novel has to respond intelligently to this fact, which is that when you see a kid, you no longer necessarily assume the kid was made by two people having sex,” he says. “It’s a huge change for our lives but also a huge change for the novel.” What was previously the material of dystopian science fiction has become everyday reality; new novels can reassure us that it’s possible to explore new modes of reproduction without becoming the totalitarian, Shakespeare-rejecting eugenicists of Aldous Huxley’s most pessimistic predictions. The story of this irregular conception causes Ben to reconsider his relationship to the world around him. If humans can reinvent even basic facts of biology, what other seemingly immutable problems can be solved? Can he do good in the world, or do all of his attempts to assert political will devolve into banal consumer choices? In between storms, the narrator gets a book deal, tutors an eight-year-old immigrant from El Salvador, takes ketamine at a writing residency in Marfa, Texas, and navigates the donation of his sperm. He wanders the bridges and parks of New York City, watches Christian Marclay’s film The Clock, and goes to the Met and the Museum of Natural History. He reflects on certain cultural totems of his childhood in the 1980s: the explosion of the Challenger spaceship, which killed seven astronauts; the movie Back to the Future; and how Peggy Noonan, Ronald Reagan’s speechwriter, introduced the budding poet to his first inklings of rhyme and metre. “I think a lot of the time the book is talked about, like, ‘Oh here’s another Brooklyn novel by a guy with glasses,’” says Lerner, who wears glasses. The vain attempts of America’s middle-class liberals to put their “first‑world problems” into context and acknowledge their disproportionate share of the world’s limited resources have been highly satirised in recent fiction, where Jonathan Franzen’s Walter Berglund (in Freedom) can be read as the literary heir to Charles Dickens’s Mrs Jellyby. In 10:04 the attempts of thirtysomethings in Brooklyn to live ethical lives is not taken as an object of derision but is treated rather earnestly. Ben goes to museums instead spending all day and night at Occupy Wall Street, but that does not mean he has given up on the promise of the latter. “I can see why, if I, the historical person, choose to write a book that’s set in Brooklyn and talks about book advances and eating bluefin tuna or whatever, that it’s just automatically in the category of the self-absorbed,” says Lerner. “The book wants to acknowledge all of that as an attempt to see what spaces for healing can exist, as opposed to the model of fiction that’s like ‘The way I deal with the political is that I pretend to have access to the mind of a nine-year-old boy in Sudan’ – instead of evading the material conditions of the book.” The result can make for an uncomfortable reading experience. I was ashamed that the narrator’s biography, place of residence, membership of the Park Slope food co-op and sometimes insipid ethical dilemmas so neatly mirrored my own. But Lerner is interested in what agency is actually available to his characters to address the great problems of the world, what he calls “modes of care”. One of the reasons why Lerner enjoys writing novels is the possibility of indulging in the subjective experiences of looking at art that traditional criticism avoids. He likes being able to write about looking at art and also about “all this other kind of contingent stuff, like how you feel and how you slept, and who you’re in love with or not in love with”. After talking in the cafe for a while, we ascend several floors to watch a work of video art that Lerner marked as his favourite piece in an exhibition of work by Brooklyn artists. The video is called Personal by Steffani Jemison. It shows different shots of East New York, a neighbourhood in Brooklyn. In a park and a basketball court, black men and boys walk or run or play on paved suraces. Sometimes they are walking backwards, sometimes forwards, and sometimes they have been edited to move in reverse. In one shot, a man strolls back and forth in front of a mural of Nelson Mandela and Barack Obama. “There are moments when you can’t tell which direction time is going when he stands there, and I was just thinking about progress in some state,” says Lerner. “It’s really weird to have these figures of post-apartheid, post-racial America and then have this man in front of this peeling mural and not know if history was happening or going backwards.” He adds, of the artist: “But I don’t know what she was setting out to do.” We watch in silence, then Lerner says he can’t help thinking about Eric Garner. Earlier that day, a grand jury had declined to indict the police officer who killed him. We sit in the museum and think about this.",,,

He first described and named Munchausen’s syndrome, and numbered Oliver Sacks, Jonathan Miller and Roger Bannister among his students. I adored him and grew up listening to fascinating descriptions of his patients and their illnesses around the dinner table. My favourite bedtime reading was Tales from the London hospital, a grisly collection that included the extraordinary story of the “Elephant Man”. At my insistence, my father took me to see Joseph Merrick’s skeleton in the hospital museum. Hospitals, strangely, give me a little frisson of positive excitement. It is probably because, as children, every Christmas morning we would go with my father to Central Middlesex hospital, where he worked, and visit each ward, where we would be encouraged to take presents off the tree. When we reached his own ward, he would put on a white chef’s hat and carve a giant turkey to distribute to the patients, while the nurses sang carols. That’s probably why I have that unusual reaction to hospitals. Three times that sense of anticipation has been fulfilled by the birth of my children, but otherwise it has been a letdown. My first memory is of being on a film set. It was Mandy, a film about a deaf child, starring a brilliant young actress called Mandy Miller. I was five. It wasn’t just acting I learned at a young age. The official chaperone who looked after me on tour when I played Wendy in Peter Pan at the age of 15 taught me to smoke, and the Lost Boys taught me a few other things in the confines of the tiny wendy house they built around me every night. If I hadn’t been an actress, I would have been a doctor. I am sure it is no coincidence that all the voluntary work I have done over the years involving autism, arthritis and Parkinson’s disease is all medically based. I’m a science groupie – the only magazine I take is the New Scientist and the only club of which I’m a member is the Royal Society of Medicine. My mother, Margaret, was an oboist. An orchestral player for much of her life, she turned to teaching once she had my brother, sister and me, and we would often arrive home from school to the sound of Bach, Handel or badly played scales. She loved us all unconditionally and was full of praise – together with my father’s more realistically critical views, they were the perfect combination. My mother was a good basic cook. But cake-decorating wasn’t her strong point and that, coupled with my showbiz instinct for making a big effect, was what led to my taking over the family celebration cakes and making them ever more personal and ornate. But if you’d have told me that, decades later, I would be writing books about them and running a small business, I’d never have believed it. I was terribly homesick as a young actress. It was hard being away from home, and it is a such a cruel and precarious profession, in which humiliation and disappointment are inevitable. It is a very unnatural existence for a child. My husband Gerald [Scarfe, the cartoonist and illustrator] and I had plenty of tempting offers for our own children – I remember in particular when our oldest, Katie, was offered the part of my daughter in A Voyage Round my Father in 1984 – but we kept them well away from show business until they were old enough to know their own minds, heavily influenced by my dire warnings. In spite of my best efforts, Katie is now an actress and, of course, I am immensely proud of her. Jane Asher stars in Eve on CBBC, Mondays at 5.30pm",,,

The Associated Press said on Friday that Tehran and Washington had agreed the outline of a deal under which Iran would ship its surplus enriched uranium to Russia. It also said negotiators had drawn up a catalogue outlining areas of potential agreement and differences in the long-running dispute. Iran’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Marzieh Afkham said, however, that “no agreement on any nuclear topic” had been reached. “Such news is spread out of political motives and its goal is to tarnish the climate of the talks and make it more complicated to reach a settlement,” the state IRNA news agency quoted her as saying. The semi-official ISNA agency, citing an “informed source”, also denied the report: “The topic of transferring uranium abroad has been circulating for a while, but we haven’t had any agreement in this regard.” Iran denies it wants to develop nuclear weapons and insists its programme is peaceful. It plans to resume talks with the US, Russia, China, France, Britain and Germany in Geneva on 15 January 15, but wide gaps remain between the two sides. Diplomats have said, however, that even agreement of a to-do-list would previously have been difficult, suggesting that at least some progress had been made. The main point of contention is uranium enrichment, which can create both reactor fuel and fissile material for weapons. The US has proposed that Tehran exports much of its enriched uranium stockpile, something which Iran has previously said it would not do. AP reported diplomats saying that both sides in the talks were still arguing about the size of stockpile Iran should be allowed to retain. It currently has enough for several bombs, and Washington wants it to have substantially less. An interim deal was struck in November 2013 for Iran to curb some aspects of its nuclear activity, including higher-grade enrichment, in return for some relief from economic sanctions. The two sides have failed, however, to meet two deadlines since on ending the standoff.",profile/dominic-smith,smith,dominic
439,2015-01-03T13:34:02Z,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/03/will-not-binge-watch-television-shows,I can't stand to binge watch television shows. I know what you think of me,commentisfree,Opinion,The Guardian,"I have never been able to binge watch television shows, despite all the modern amenities that put seasons upon seasons of obscure and groundbreaking television at my fingertips. Instead, I linger, too intimidated to begin what has always felt like a chore, while everyone I know flies through a whole series in a week to catch up – or keep up – with the cultural conversation.  The first show I tried to binge watch was Pretty Little Liars, a ridiculous three-season teen drama now on Netflix that illustrates one of the main problems with binge-watching: if a show is bad, you notice really quickly. The constant cliffhangers and campiness would have kept me coming back had I watched it in real time – but, watching a dozen episodes all in a row on Netflix revealed just how monotonously formulaic it really was. A similar thing happened when a group of friends and I tried to binge on Sabrina, The Teenage Witch: even nostalgia could only hold our attention for about six episodes. Being unable to stomach hours of middling teen TV may not seem like a great cultural loss, but it’s not just “bad” shows that can’t hold my interest for hours at a go. I’ve dutifully sat through most of The Wire, but have been stalled halfway through the fifth season for about six months (and, with every day, I have less and less intention of ever finishing). I’m also halfway through the eight-episode first season of Twin Peaks, but if my husband didn’t bring up watching the next installment so often, I’m not sure I’d remember to re-start. My friends assume that my inability to binge-watch means that I don’t like brilliant shows or, worse, that I don’t like television at all. I am berated for not taking the time to consume pieces of our collective history; I am told of the countless series that have shaped our media landscape, the ur-texts considered necessary for understanding anything currently being produced. I would probably enjoy watching a lot of the shows they mention – I’ve enjoyed The Wire and Twin Peaks – but actually finishing them feels more like a chore and less like the entertainment I thought TV was supposed to be. The problem is that I am incredibly impatient, which would seem the perfect fuel for a binge watching habit. Instead, I’m driven to simply look up the endings of shows that went off the air years ago, and find myself satisfied just knowing what happens. These good shows have made their impressions on other people and society already and, while I can curiously listen in, the truth is that I missed the original conversation, so it’s no longer as interesting. It’s a good thing, then, that I’ve never been bothered by “spoilers” (and that I think information about a show’s plot ceases to be a “spoiler” if the show ended a decade ago). Knowing how something ends does not ruin the story for me – but I do increasingly enjoy the ritual of watching the story unfold on actual live television. I love getting together with friends and watching together: laughing or gasping at the same moments; frantically dissecting character motives during the commercial breaks; and guessing at the next week’s plot before we disperse. We count down the weeks or months until a new season starts or a show returns from hiatus, with a guarantee that, no matter how hectic our lives get, we have a standing date to watch. Binge watching doesn’t give me any of that when I partake either solitarily or with a group. It’s instead a race to complete something for the sake of completing it, to get to an ending that is often just a Google search away. I even know people who will refuse to watch shows currently on TV, and who go to great lengths to avoid “spoilers”, just waiting until they can sit down and watch a whole series in one go. For them, the isolation of binge watching is pretty much the point – as is the immediacy of being able to see what happens without waiting for weeks as a season unfolds. I find I prefer to be part of the journey – almost to the point where the finish has ceased to matter as much as getting there.",profile/jaya-saxena,saxena,jaya
